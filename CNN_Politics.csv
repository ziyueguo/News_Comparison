The next Obama: Democrats grapple with the former president's legacy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/obama-legacy-2020/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Joe Biden has said former President Barack Obama has nothing to apologize for. Pete Buttigieg's campaign has compared his rise in Iowa to that of Obama's a dozen years ago. Kamala Harris was once heralded as the best candidate to unite the Obama electorate.And Deval Patrick, the latest candidate to get into the race, is Obama's closest friend in the primary field, sharing both a personal story and close relationship with the former President.Obama may have left office nearly three years ago, but his presence -- and the legacy he left from running two successful presidential campaigns -- looms over the 2020 race, with many of the Democrats looking to retake his old job by attempting to lay claim to portions of the Obama mantle.That was evident at Wednesday night's Democratic debate. Harris said she would ""rebuild the Obama coalition."" Biden claimed to be ""part of the Obama coalition."" And Buttigieg used Obama's words to validate himself.How to approach Obama's eight years in office has become a complicated question for Democratic presidential candidates. While at times some of the them have seemingly tried to out-Obama each other with their reverence for the last president, there have been flashes of discord between the candidates over the former president's legacy.The second Democratic debate in July was the highlight of the anti-Obama sentiment inside the 2020 race, with a host of candidates questioning the former President's immigration and health care policy. The arguments have been of pragmatism vs. progressivism and show how some liberals in the party believe the former president didn't do enough in office.Then there are Democrats like Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who ended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden this month, and recently warned Democrats of focusing too closely on Obama suggesting comparing candidates to the former president belies that ""every election is unique.""Walking the tightrope of embracing a former popular president and giving your own take on the positive vision for the future is tricky,"" said Jen Psaki, Obama's former White House communications director. But ""Obama remains the most popular Democrat today, so for any candidate to run on building and building beyond his legacy is smart.""The internal debate is evidence of a party coming to grips with how three years out of power -- and the rise of President Donald Trump, a figure singularly different than the former President -- has changed the Democratic Party. While the lines at the second debate helped candidates score points on Biden, there was quick blowback from some Democratic activists and operatives, further proof of Obama's rock-solid popularity inside the Democratic Party.Obama, for his part, has urged candidates to find their own balance of acknowledging what his administration accomplished and building beyond his record, telling donors at a high-priced confab earlier this month that he hopes candidates build beyond what he accomplished because that ""is the whole point.""""I built off the process other people made,"" he said last week. ""And tried to take the baton and run the race a little further and then I expect people to take the baton from me and then I want them to run it a little further from that"".But Obama's advice also came with a warning. The former President told the candidates to ""pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters.""Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,"" Obama said, adding that candidates should not think ""if you get so far out and you think automatically people will follow because 'look at how bold and creative I am.'""Advisers to some of the moderate candidates cheered these comments, viewing them as an indictment of liberal leaders like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Obama's decision to make a rare comment on the 2020 race has further complicated his standing in the primary. Warren, for example, entirely dodged a question about the comments, instead choosing to laud the former President.Obama's outspokenness is likely to continue, too, as the former president is slated to keep a full schedule this week and in the coming months. Obama gave the keynote address of the annual Greenbuild International Conference on Wednesday in Atlanta, the same day as the debate, and will next travel to San Francisco, where he will headline a top-dollar fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and give remarks.Who can claim the Obama mantle?Biden is -- by far -- the candidate with the clearest claim to the Obama mantle. He was the president's number two, stood by him for eight years and mentions him often on the campaign trail, regularly using what the duo accomplished in office as a way to explain why voters should back him in 2020.And conversations with his supporters show how important his time with Obama -- and the fact that the former president worked with him for eight years -- is to his presidential bid.Karen Macias, a 30-year old Nevada voter born in Mexico but raised in Las Vegas, is leaning toward Biden/""That is a huge part of the reason. ... I am assuming because he worked with him in the past, he will do a lot of things like him,"" said Macias, who has lived in Las Vegas since 2000. ""It's the biggest reason why I would vote for him.""That was echoed by Rev. Jerome Lewis, the 56-year old reverend of a black Christian church in Las Vegas.""I think Obama had seen something in him, to where he said if I am not here, you can do it,"" Lewis said. ""That is what I like about it, that Obama had faith in him. Of all the candidates he could have picked, he chose Biden.""But what Biden has in actually connections to the former president, the 76-year old Democrat lacks in the kind of newness and excitement that propelled Obama in 2008.If Biden is the candidate most closely tied to Obama, Patrick is the newly minted candidate most similar to the former President.Obama and Patrick are close friends and the former Massachusetts governor called the former president to get advice on his late entry 2020 bid. Patrick's first campaign for governor in 2006 was helmed by political consultants David Axelrod and David Plouffe, who would later go on to work for Obama, and Patrick's slogan -- ""Together We Can"" -- was seen as a precursor to Obama's hopeful message in 2008.More than that, though, the two share similar personal stories. Obama, throughout his career, has been tied to the South Side of Chicago and his presidential library is slated to be built in the neighborhood he moved to after college. But Patrick's ties to the area are even deeper: He was born and raised in the South Side of Chicago and only left when he received a scholarship to attend the prestigious Milton Academy in Massachusetts.Despite that, Patrick said Sunday that he thinks this moment calls for something different than what Obama offered.""I think President Obama was a terrific president. He's been a friend and was a friend along a long time before he was in any public office. And I supported him from the beginning,"" Patrick said. ""But I also think that the moment demands something different from whomever our next president is and will get from me.""Where Biden and Patrick have actual ties to Obama, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg appears to be the candidate that voters most often compare to the former President.The mayor, at 37 years old, is young, offers a historic candidacy and running against the standard politics, three things Obama had over his opponents in 2008. Buttigieg's campaign has leaned into the Obama comparisons, and his supporters often draw those parallels.""It's the intelligence, it's the cool composure, it's the ability to be presidential,"" said Terri Hale, an Iowa activist who backed Obama in 2008 and is now backing Buttigieg. ""The energy, the excitement and the positivity and the hope, that is what I feel at events for Pete. And I gave not felt that since Barack Obama."" Unlike the nation's first black president, though, Buttigieg's existential struggle as a candidate is his inability to win black voters, something that did not hamper Obama but could sink the mayor's candidacy given how important vlack voters are to the Democratic Party.People close to Obama have skeptically watched the candidates struggle with the former president legacy, with one source close to Obama telling CNN that ""the irony of trying to fashion yourself as the next Obama is that Obama had this incredible sense of self, he knew who he was and had a level of authenticity that voters responded to."" Axelrod, Obama's longtime top adviser, said ""seizing the Obama mantle and record is fundamental"" for Biden, while others are ""claiming the spirit is, at a minimum, a box to check"" because of Obama's outsized popularity inside the party.""Underneath,"" Axelrod said, ""there is the same tension that existed when Obama first ran, between those who argue for dramatic, defiant change and those who argue for change by forging consensus a big, diverse democracy requires.""CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report."
Judiciary Committee clashes over impeachment ahead of vote to send articles to the floor,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/judiciary-committee-impeachment-amendment-vote-thursday/index.html,"The messy legislative sausage-making prompted a debate over the President's conduct and the impeachment proceedings themselves, as Republicans sought to poke holes and do away altogether with the impeachment articles against the President.LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Trump impeachment inquiryLawmakers sparred at length over an amendment to remove the entire first article, charging Trump with abuse of power, from the impeachment resolution, and scores more amendments from Republicans were expected Thursday in a debate that could last late into the day.The committee process for debating and approving the articles is used for hundreds of pieces of legislation on Capitol Hill each year, but Thursday's debate is as contentious as ever with a vote by the full House to remove the President from office potentially less than a week away.The committee debate follows the Democratic introduction of two articles of impeachment against the President, charging him with abuse of power for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals while withholding US security aid and a White House meeting, and obstruction of Congress for refusing to cooperate in any manner with the impeachment inquiry into his conduct.Thursday's committee vote to approve the articles sets the stage for a vote on the House floor that is likely to make Trump the third president in US history to be impeached. Democratic leadership sources say they could lose more than at least two moderate Democrats on the impeachment votes, but there's no concern about major defections that could endanger the articles.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is not lobbying moderates on the fence to vote for impeachment.""People have to come to their own conclusions,"" Pelosi said.The speaker said the facts are clear, and she isn't concerned about losing more Democrats on the articles of impeachment than the two who voted against the resolution establishing procedures for the inquiry. ""People will vote the way they vote,"" she said.While the White House did not participate in the House impeachment proceedings, Trump weighed in on the debate Thursday, tweeting that two Democrats were misconstruing his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the US President he asked for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.""Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call,"" Trump said. ""I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.""But the White House is preparing for the proceedings to move to the Senate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland huddled Thursday in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office.""We are having a lot of good conversations with Senate Republicans,"" Ueland said after the meeting. ""We will continue to do that here over the next few days and weeks as we work through all these issues and priorities the President has outlined when it comes to where we should go on these articles, which starts with defeating them in the House because they are not based on the facts.""House Republican leaders, meanwhile, are lobbying their members on the House floor to oppose impeachment, as Republicans work to keep the number of GOP defections on impeachment at zero. A free-wheeling committee debateThursday's debate was free-wheeling, as any committee member was able to offer an amendment to the impeachment articles and every lawmaker could speak up to debate it.The first Republican amendment, introduced by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, simply removed the first impeachment article from the resolution. It was defeated in a party-line vote.""Article one in this resolution ignores the truth, ignores the facts, it ignores what happened and what has been laid out for the American people over the last three weeks,"" Jordan said.Democrats responded that Republicans were ignoring the President's misconduct, continuing the partisan debate over impeachment that began on Wednesday night when every lawmaker on the 41-member committee delivered an opening statement.""The President committed the highest crime against the Constitution by abusing his office,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. ""Cheating in an election, inviting foreign interference for a purely personal gain while jeopardizing our national security and the integrity of our elections.""Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida offered the second Republican amendment to replace Joe Biden's name in the impeachment resolution with the ""well-known corrupt company, Burisma,"" and Hunter Biden, saying that Hunter Biden's appointment to the Ukrainian energy company ""looks dirty as it is."" The amendment was also defeated along party lines.Explaining the resolution, Gaetz walked through Hunter Biden's substance abuse problems, which drew a sharp rebuke from Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. ""I would say that the pot calling the kettle black is not something that we should do,"" Johnson said.He then alluded to Gaetz's past DUI arrest, without mentioning him by name: ""I don't know what members, if any, have had any problems with substance abuse, been busted in DUI, I don't know,"" Johnson said. ""But if I did, I wouldn't raise it against anyone on this committee.""Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence in 2008, but the charges were later dismissed. He said he was ""focused on the President"" and didn't think the public was ""hanging on a traffic incident I had a decade ago.""The impeachment debate even veered back two decades, as two lawmakers who were on the Judiciary Committee when President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 debated the merits of that case compared to the current impeachment proceedings.""I would just like to note that the argument that somehow, lying about a sexual affair is an abuse of presidential power, but the misuse of presidential power to get a benefit somehow doesn't matter -- if it's lying about sex, we could put Stormy Daniels' case ahead of us,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was also a congressional staffer during the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon. ""We don't believe that's a high crime and misdemeanor.""Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was an impeachment manager in 1998, argued there was a clear crime in the Clinton impeachment.""The important thing is, is that Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury. That is a crime,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""The article of impeachment that passed the House accused Bill Clinton of lying to a grand jury, a crime, and something that obstructs the ability of the courts to get to the truth. This is not what is happening here. Big difference.""Republicans' efforts to change the text of the impeachment articles or block them entirely were ultimately futile, thanks to the Democrats' 23-17 advantage in the committee. But for each amendment, every member had the opportunity to speak for five minutes -- meaning Republicans could extend the committee meeting as long as they wanted to keep talking.""If we have to fact check you all night, we will,"" Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said Thursday afternoon, saying he wasn't concerned about the congressional ball at the White House taking place Thursday evening.Republicans also detailed their process complaints about the impeachment proceedings. Collins demanded House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler agree to hold a Republican hearing day before moving forward, but his objection was defeated along party lines.""This committee has become nothing but a rubber stamp,"" Collins said. ""This committee is amazingly now on such a clock and calendar process that they don't care -- facts be damned.""Committee vote sets up House to impeach Trump next weekHouse Democratic leaders have not said yet when the impeachment articles will go to the floor, but a vote is expected next week, along with votes to fund the government and hand the President a significant win by approving the new US trade deal.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the path forward  on the House floor would be announced later Thursday.When the impeachment resolution comes to the floor, the House will take separate votes on each article of impeachment. Two Democratic leadership sources say it's possible they could lose more than two Democrats — the number who voted against the procedural vote on the impeachment inquiry in October — when the floor vote takes place.Those two Democrats, Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Colin Peterson of Minnesota, have already said they will vote against the impeachment articles. At the same time, Democrats are likely to pick up independent Justin Amash of Michigan.But the sources acknowledge they could lose a handful more from swing districts on either or both articles. Many vulnerable members are not saying what they'll do yet, as they head back to their districts this weekend and get feedback from voters.Democrats are not expecting mass defections and they expect to have more than enough votes for final passage.Two other Democratic leadership sources say they are not planning to whip their members on the floor vote on the articles, meaning they won't twist arms to keep Democrats in line. That is intended to back up what Pelosi has been saying throughout the impeachment proceedings: The vote will be a ""vote of conscience.""This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."
Impeachment inquiry's move to Judiciary Committee returns spotlight to its chairman,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/jerry-nadler-house-judiciary-committee-preview/index.html," (CNN)House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler will once again be in the hot seat Wednesday, as the impeachment inquiry moves to a new phase from gathering information to possibly charging President Donald Trump with crimes.In the past two months, the House Intelligence Committee has issued dozens of subpoenas and taken more than 100 hours of testimony from current and former Trump administration officials. It held seven public hearings featuring a dozen witnesses. On Monday, it issued a 300-page report alleging that that Trump abused his power and obstructed justice in pressuring Ukraine to open investigations against Democrats.But now, that panel will retreat into the background as the Judiciary Committee is expected to draft articles of impeachment.Nadler worked for months on his own sweeping investigation into Trump, his campaign's activities and potential obstruction of justice requesting information from more than 80 individuals and entities with ties to the President. But, Nadler -- who pledged the House was engaged an impeachment inquiry before the Ukraine scandal boiled over -- had faced some criticism from colleagues who argued some of the high-profile hearings including that one with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had gone off the rails. Now, Nadler's committee will be responsible for deciding on the scope the articles of impeachment and whether to keep them focused on the Ukraine scandal or reach back as far as issues related to Mueller.The House Judiciary Committee's opening hearing Wednesday will feature four constitutional law experts and be a far cry from the high-profile testimony Nadler oversaw this summer with former special counsel Robert Mueller. Instead, the tone will be academic, a recitation of the merits of impeachment, its history and its purpose in democracy. The House Intelligence Committee's hearings brought with them stunning admissions from career State Department officials, heated exchanges and sometimes colorful language.The Judiciary Committee's hearing Wednesday won't be that.""I don't think our responsibility is to entertain the American people,"" House Judiciary Committee member David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, told CNN. ""This is deadly serious. This is about making sure the American people know what is at stake. This is about the preservation of our democracy.Up until now, the hearings in the House Intelligence Committee have been made up of a smaller group of members selected by the leaders of each party for their serious-minded manners, who are entrusted with secret information handled in private settings. Many of the witnesses were sober-minded, career federal government officials keen on discussing the matter at hand: Trump seeking investigations of his political opponents from Ukraine, while using aid and a coveted White House meeting as leverage. The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, is almost twice as large, and filled with some of each side's loudest defenders, skilled in waging fights over the country's most divisive issues, including immigration, abortion and gun control. Nadler's job in part will be containing the personalities on his committee.""He's more than up to the task,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia told CNN. ""You know, Jerry Nadler is in his own right a constitutional scholar. He specializes here in constitutional law, and he's a very, you know, a very measured person in terms of parsing through issues and looking at them through a very disciplined mind, and he will bring that kind of legal temperament to the task at hand.""Leading up to the Judiciary Committee's hearing, House Democrats on the committee praised Nadler saying he's well-equipped to handle the first impeachment hearing. Rep. Val Demings, Democrat of Florida, said that the House passed new rules determining this hearing, which will allow staff counsel to extract information regarding the Constitution's grounds for impeachment from four preeminent law professors. She also said Nadler's long experience -- nearly three decades -- in Congress and playing a pivotal role during the Clinton impeachment ,will serve him well.""It's not his first impeachment inquiry,"" she noted.Nadler also is set to not let Republicans take control of the hearing. In a Tuesday morning session preparing for Wednesday's hearing, Nadler reportedly said, ""I'm not going to take any s--t,"" according to Politico.When asked about the remark, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat representing Brooklyn, New York, smiled and joked about his colleague from Manhattan. ""Is that something that someone from the Upper West Side would say?"" asked Jeffries.Jeffries later added that Nadler is ""a constitutional scholar"" who will face a ""a formidable adversary"" in Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the panel. In a possible preview of that message, Collins and other committee Republicans sent a letter to Nadler on Tuesday criticizing what they described as ""Democrats' obsession with impeaching the President and undoing the 2016 election.""Jeffries made a plea on Tuesday evening for cooler heads to prevail.""It's my hope and my expectation that both sides will conduct themselves with the decency, the dignity and respect that the process of an impeachment inquiry deserves,"" he said.CNN's Jeremy Herb and Clare Foran contributed to this report."
Nearly 3 in 4 Americans say impeachment won't change minds,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/politics/impeachment-public-opinion-polling-monmouth/index.html,"But the American public isn't optimistic that minds will change.A new poll from Monmouth University found 71% say they believe Americans are set in their opinions on the impeachment inquiry, regardless of new information that comes to light. Only 24% say that new information in the impeachment inquiry could change the minds of the American people. That's very similar to numbers from way back in March.Overall, 45% of Americans want Trump impeached, while 50% say they do not. That's the same split as in November. Trump's approval rating also continues to hold steady at 43% approving and 50% disapproving. That hasn't budged much over the last year. Monmouth's polling shows Trump's approval rating has ranged from 40% to 44%, while his disapproval rating has ranged from 50% to 54%, during the last 12 months.One note on timing: This poll was conducted by telephone December 4 to 8 -- well after the House's hearings had been underway but before this week's Judiciary Committee hearings.Trump is now the fourth president in US history to face articles of impeachment. That gives this entire process more historical gravitas and much higher stakes. Even if public opinion isn't moving, the entire saga will still go down in history. But the fact that Americans don't think new information could change opinions shows just how deeply entrenched those opinions are.The Point: Democrats and Republicans are working hard to make their cases on impeachment. But is anyone open to being persuaded?"
Nadler: Impeachment would be a guilty verdict in 'three minutes flat',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/jerry-nadler-donald-trump-impeachment-obstruction-of-justice/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)With sources telling CNN a vote in the Judiciary Committee to impeach President Donald Trump is expected as soon as this week, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Sunday that he sees the Ukraine evidence as part of ""a pattern"" of conduct by the President. But, in an interview Sunday with CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union,"" Nadler would not commit to including the evidence of obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller's special counsel report as part of the articles of impeachment.Nadler said he was confident in Democrats' ""solid"" case for impeachment, expressing optimism about the matter as the party moves closer to drafting articles. He thinks his party's case ""if presented to a jury would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat."" ""There is considerable direct evidence,"" Nadler said, adding that ""it ill behooves a President or his partisans to say you don't have enough direct evidence when the reason we don't have even more evidence is the President has ordered everybody in the executive branch not to cooperate with Congress in the impeachment inquiry.""Sunday's comments from Nadler, a New York Democrat, come a day after his committee released a report laying out historical arguments for impeachment. The Saturday report did not accuse Trump of committing impeachable offenses, but it lays the groundwork for a Monday hearing before the panel, where evidence against Trump will be presented by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, as well as the possible introduction of articles of impeachment next week.Nadler said decisions about what to include in articles of impeachment will be made following the hearing, telling Bash: ""We're going to have to take a lot of considerations into account."" ""What is the level of proof for the various allegations? How do they relate together? What is the level of support in our caucus and in the House for them? What might we persuade the Senate of -- all of these things have to be taken into account, realizing again that the central allegation, it's all of a pattern,"" Nadler said. As Democrats consider including evidence from Mueller's probe into the articles, Trump's conduct as detailed in the special counsel's report will at least be part of Monday's discussion.Democratic sources say that Monday's hearing will showcase a ""pattern of behavior"" of Trump that shows impeachable conduct while in office.House Judiciary Committee counsel Barry Berke is likely to detail a pattern of Trump's behavior in his opening statement. That will likely include some discussion of the details of the Mueller report, sources said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry along with Nadler, would not on Sunday say explicitly whether he supports including information from the Mueller report in articles of impeachment, but seemed to indicate he does not.""I can tell you as a former prosecutor it's always been you know, my strategy, in a charging decision, and an impeachment in the House is essentially a charging decision, to charge those that there's the strongest and most overwhelming evidence, and not try to charge everything even though you could charge other things,"" he said in interview on CBS' ""Face The Nation."" He later added: ""I think we should focus on those issues that provide the greatest threat to the country.""'Patriots or partisans'Although Nadler during the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton warned against ""a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other,"" the chairman on Sunday expressed little concern about the total lack of support from Republicans for Trump's impeachment. ""So you are willing to impeach the President with no Republican votes, correct?"" Bash asked him. ""We're going to impeach the President -- if we impeach the President -- we will impeach him on adequate, urgent grounds to defend our democratic republic,"" Nadler responded, prompting Bash to ask if he's fine with there possibly being no Republican votes in favor of impeachment.Nadler mostly dismissed Republican complaints regarding the fairness of the process saying the GOP and the President have been offered the opportunity to present witnesses and have seen the public reports. ""It's up to them to decide whether they want to be patriots or partisans,"" he replied. Nadler also said he declined last week to call the eight witnesses Republicans requested to come before the committee because he viewed them as being ""irrelevant."" ""They can appeal to the full committee if they wish and we'll have a vote on that. But like any trial judge, you keep the witnesses to the relevancy,"" he said, adding that ""every procedure, every fairness has been given to them."" ""They have had adequate time (to call witnesses),"" Nadler told Bash, referring to House rules that require him to give Republicans a day to call their own witnesses. In anticipation of Monday's hearing members of the House Judiciary Committee spent Sunday much like Saturday, prepping in the same hearing room they'll sit in Monday and workshopping potential questions in real time.They were joined on Sunday by Cass Sunstein, according to one person familiar. Sunstein, a constitutional scholar who also worked as the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during the Obama administration, was a vocal opponent of the Clinton impeachment.

"Rep. Duncan Hunter spent $625 on 'flights for a pet rabbit,' report shows",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/duncan-hunter-flight-pet-rabbit/index.html," (CNN)Embattled Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter spent upwards of $45,000 from his campaign on personal expenditures -- including $625 on flights for a pet rabbit, according to a House Ethics Committee report released Monday.The California congressman announced last week that he would resign after the holidays, following his guilty plea to federal corruption charges stemming from his misuse of more than $200,000 in campaign funds. The committee urged Hunter in a letter last week to stop voting on legislation and other matters on the House floor.Hunter, who represents the northeastern San Diego area, had previously denied dipping into campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, including video games, an Italian vacation and groceries.The committee report released Monday found records of those expenses -- as well as charges for flights for a pet rabbit.An unnamed staffer told investigators ""that at some point after she no longer worked in the congressional office, Rep. Hunter kept a rabbit named Cadbury in his congressional office"" that ""had a cage in the congressional office,"" according to the report. ""Rep. Hunter and his wife repeatedly used campaign committee funds for flight costs with no clear campaign nexus, including the cost of flying a pet rabbit,"" the report states, adding that ""in 2014 and 2015, Rep. Hunter's campaign committee spent $625.00 on five separate $125.00 'pet in cabin' United Airlines charges to fly a pet rabbit.""Hunter and his wife Margaret were indicted in August 2018 for using funds to pay for personal expenses, leading him to step down from his congressional committee assignments, though he later went on to win reelection after running an anti-Muslim campaign against his Democratic opponent. Margaret Hunter pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiring with her husband to ""knowingly and willingly"" convert campaign funds for personal use.CNN's Lauren Fox, Clare Foran, Devan Cole and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report."
Analysis: Sanders responds to Clinton's accusation: 'I'm sorry that Hillary Clinton is rerunning 2016',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-howard-stern-interview/index.html," (CNN)Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday denied an accusation made by Hillary Clinton last week that the Vermont senator's delayed endorsement in 2016 hurt her Democratic presidential candidacy, saying that he did everything he could to get the former secretary of state elected president. ""I'm sorry that Hillary Clinton is rerunning 2016,"" Sanders said in an interview with Iowa Press that aired Sunday. ""I could take out a letter from Hillary Clinton saying, 'Thank you Bernie for working so hard to try to make me the President of the United States.' "" Sanders' rebuttal comes after Clinton talked to Howard Stern Wednesday in a radio interview in which she spoke to questions of whether the Democratic Party did enough to come together during the last presidential election cycle. ""I don't hate anybody,"" Clinton said when Stern asked about Sanders and his 2016 Democratic primary campaign. But Clinton did not hesitate to point out that she believed Sanders' delayed endorsement hurt her campaign. ""He hurt me there's no doubt about it, and I hope he doesn't do it again to whoever gets the nomination. Once is enough,"" Clinton said. Sanders said Sunday that he ""worked as hard as humanly possible"" once Clinton was the Democratic nominee. ""We did dozens and dozens of rallies around this country,"" he added. Sanders also mentioned how the pair sat down in 2016 after Clinton won the primary ""to create a Democratic platform that was as progressive as it could be, and that ended up happening."""
Eric Holder says Barr 'unfit' to serve as attorney general,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/eric-holder-william-barr-unfit-attorney-general/index.html,"In the opinion piece published Wednesday night, Holder, who served in the Obama administration between 2009 and 2015, excoriated Barr for ""a series of public statements and ... actions that are so plainly ideological, so nakedly partisan and so deeply inappropriate"" for an attorney general to make. He pointed to a number of recent headline-grabbing remarks by Barr, including his comments this week that the FBI may have acted in ""bad faith"" when it opened an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe despite the Justice Department's inspector general report that said the bureau was justified in doing so.""(It) was infuriating to watch him publicly undermine an independent inspector general report -- based on an exhaustive review of the FBI's conduct -- using partisan talking points bearing no resemblance to the facts his own department has uncovered,"" he wrote. Holder, who said he was ""reluctant to publicly criticize (his) successors,"" also blasted Barr for comments he made last month at an event held by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, in which the attorney general affirmed his credentials as a staunch defender of presidential power, trashed the so-called resistance movement and mocked Senate Democrats. ""To me, his attempts to vilify the President's critics sounded more like the tactics of an unscrupulous criminal defense lawyer than a U.S. attorney general,"" Holder wrote, adding that in his comments, Barr ""exposed himself as a partisan actor, not an impartial law enforcement official."" ""Virtually since the moment he took office, though, Barr's words and actions have been fundamentally inconsistent with his duty to the Constitution,"" Holder wrote. ""Which is why I now fear that his conduct -- running political interference for an increasingly lawless president -- will wreak lasting damage.""CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. The former attorney general also went after Barr for ""bizarre"" comments he made at an event last week about the need for people to show ""respect and support"" for law enforcement or they risk finding ""themselves without the police protection they need.""""It is antithetical to the most basic tenets of equality and justice, and it undermines the need for understanding between law enforcement and certain communities and flies in the face of everything the Justice Department stands for,"" Holder wrote.

Jewish leaders criticized Trump for telling Jewish audience they have 'no choice' but to vote for him instead of Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/donald-trump-accused-of-anti-semitic-language/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Several Jewish groups have criticized President Donald Trump over a speech he delivered Saturday to an Israeli-American organization, accusing him of using anti-Semitic stereotypes.Speaking at the Israeli American Council National Summit in Florida, Trump suggested that many of the attendees at the event are wealthy and in real estate and that their wealth would guide their votes in the 2020 presidential election.""A lot of you are in the real estate business because I know you very well. You're brutal killers, not nice people at all. But you have to vote for me, you have no choice,"" he said. Trump argued the Israeli-American crowd would not be able to vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, because of her proposed wealth tax plan. ""You're not going to vote for the wealth tax. ...Yeah, let's take 100% of your wealth away. No, no. Even if you don't like me, some of you don't. Some of you, I don't like at all actually. And you're going to be my biggest supporters because you'd be out of business in about 15 minutes if they get it,"" Trump said.Warren has proposed a plan that would impose a 2% tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on billionaires. It does not specifically address marginal tax rates.Trump's remarks were greeted with laughter and applause from the conservative-leaning crowd, which at several points during Trump's speech chanted ""four more years.""But the remarks drew sharp criticism from several Jewish groups that argued Trump was peddling anti-Semitic tropes by suggesting Jewish people are motivated by money. The American Jewish Committee on Sunday called for Trump to change his rhetoric.""Dear @POTUS - Much as we appreciate your unwavering support for Israel, surely there must be a better way to appeal to American Jewish voters, as you just did in Florida, than by money references that feed age-old and ugly stereotypes. Let's stay off that mine-infested road.""Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, a group that monitors anti-Semitism around the world, also denounced Trump's remarks in a series of Twitter posts, arguing he trafficked in ""anti-Semitic tropes.""""While important @POTUS called out BDS and #antiSemitism, it's essentially undone by his own trafficking of #antiSemitic tropes: questioning American Jews' loyalty to Israel and asserting that Jewish voters only care about their wealth,"" Greenblatt tweeted on Sunday. ""Instead of speaking singularly about hate, he attacked Ds. While some trends on the left are incredibly problematic, that's no excuse to discount/ignore hateful trends on the extreme right that led to the murder of Jews in Pittsburgh & Poway; Latinos in #ElPaso; and others.""Greenblatt added: ""So, yet again, we're reminded of the necessity to call out #antiSemitism as a vile poison but these comments fall short of the mark and actually could empower those who traffic in bigotry.""Halie Soifer, executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, slammed Trump's remarks as ""anti-Semitic"" and ""deeply offensive.""""As predicted, @realDonaldTrump, addressing a room full of Jews, invoked anti-Semitic tropes suggesting Jews are motivated by money and not loyal ""enough"" to Israel,"" she said in a post on Twitter on Sunday. ""His remarks were unequivocally anti-Semitic, deeply offensive, and completely consistent with his past statements.""Matt Brooks, the executive Director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, defended Trump's comments, saying ""To all those who are saying @realDonaldTrump trafficked in anti-semitic tropes in his speech last night by talking about how the Dems will tax them see their wealth evaporate- get over yourselves. He literally talks about this at every rally!""This is not the first time the President has been accused of making anti-Semitic remarks or peddling anti-Semitic tropes.In August, Jewish leaders criticized Trump over his remarks that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats show ""either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.""Trump made similar remarks on Saturday, castigating some Jewish Americans for not loving Israel ""enough.""While Trump came under fire for making anti-Semitic remarks, the President also spent part of his speech addressing the rise in anti-Semitism in the US and around the world and proclaimed that his administration ""is committed to aggressively challenging and confronting anti-Semitic bigotry in every resource, and using every single weapon at our disposal.""Trump also accused ""far-left members of Congress"" of pushing ""dangerous anti-Semitic rhetoric"" and called the fight against anti-Semitism ""a top priority for our country."" He also invited Elan Carr, the US's special envoy for combatting anti-Semitism, to the stage. "
Trump's former physician retires from Navy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/ronny-jackson-retires-from-navy/index.html," (CNN)President Donald Trump's former chief physician, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, retired from the Navy on Sunday even as the Defense Department's Inspector General continues to investigate allegations that he was periodically intoxicated and mishandled prescription drugs, CNN has learned.Jackson withdrew from consideration to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs in light of similar allegations last year.Former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer approved Jackson's retirement before his ouster, according to a senior DOD official. Jackson did not respond to a request for comment. Typically military officials under inspector general investigation are not allowed to retire until the probe is completed. However, there are provisions for personnel to retire while under investigation under the condition they might be brought back on active duty to face disciplinary action if wrongdoing is found in administrative matters such as the allegations facing Jackson. In that case, standard military procedures would allow for Jackson to be brought back on active duty and face a reprimand or even a reduction of rank in his retirement, which could impact his pension -- though Trump could also overturn any potential disciplinary action.Dwrena Allen, spokeswoman for the inspector general, told CNN that the investigation remains ongoing. Two other officials tell CNN that it has been difficult to conduct the investigation because all requests for interviews or information have had to go through the White House.Trump re-nominated Jackson to receive a second star -- a bump in his military rank -- in February, though that promotion was not approved by the Senate. This came less than a year after Jackson withdrew from consideration as Trump's nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs over allegations that he was ""abusive"" toward colleagues, loosely handled prescription pain medications and was periodically intoxicated. Jackson denied all of the allegations leveled against him, calling them ""completely false and fabricated.""CNN has previously reported that Jackson is considering a run for Congress in Texas, according to a source familiar with his plans. A Texas native, Jackson is eyeing a run as a Republican in the 13th District, which opened after longtime GOP incumbent Mac Thornberry announced his retirement. Trump won the district by 63 points in 2016.Jackson also served as a physician for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. CNN's Caroline Kelly contributed to this report."
"Kennedy says he's done talking about Ukraine, as Senate GOP is sharply divided on the issue",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/republican-senate-john-kennedy-ukraine-reaction/index.html," (CNN)Republican Sen. John Kennedy said he's done talking about Ukraine, days after stirring up a controversy with his on-again, off-again, on-again theories about whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 US election. ""There's nothing else I'm going to say on it,"" he told a group of reporters who rushed to speak to him as he made his way through a crowded Capitol basement to take an elevator to the Senate floor for a vote. CNN asked the Louisiana senator -- who is famous for his loquacious, Southern-accented and folksy manner -- if that meant he's never again talking about the Ukraine interference matter, after making headlines on the issue for days. ""No,"" he said, he wasn't. ""Reasonable people can disagree. I believe what I believe and some people believe otherwise and they are entitled to it.""Kennedy then implored an elevator operator to help him escape the reporters and seemed to acknowledge that his shifting Ukraine views -- disputed by many other GOP senators but backed by President Donald Trump -- had hurt him. ""Ma'am, can you help me here,"" Kennedy called out. ""These people are trying to kill me and hurt me the entire time that I'm dying.""As he finally climbed aboard the ""Senators Only"" elevator, he bumped directly into Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, who moments earlier had told many of the same reporters that he strongly disagrees with Kennedy that Ukraine interfered in the US elections. Reporters had pressed Romney to directly criticize his fellow Republican but he declined to take their offer.A reporter asked the senators if they were going to hash out their differences while riding up. ""Mitt said I don't have to answer,"" Kennedy replied as the doors shut.Kennedy's comments Tuesday afternoon followed remarks he had made in the morning to CNN's Suzanne Malveaux after he was repeatedly asked about the evidence for his claim of Ukraine's election meddling.""There's no question in my mind Ukraine did try to influence the election,"" Kennedy said Tuesday morning.""I do believe that Ukraine tried to influence our election in 2016 and I think our media has documented it well,"" he said, pointing to examples including reports in the Financial Times and Politico, as well as an op-ed by the Ukrainian ambassador in The Hill, as well as Facebook posts. ""Now, that doesn't mean that Russia didn't. Russia did. Russia was the master at it."" When asked if he was spreading Russian propaganda that Ukraine was involved in US election meddling, Kennedy replied, ""Well, I have no way of knowing what Vladimir Putin says or thinks. I think he's a thug or a monster, but I don't think any of these periodicals have withdrawn the articles.""Moments after Kennedy and Romney exited on the elevator Tuesday afternoon, two other GOP lawmakers who are wary of the claims about Ukraine arrived. Standing in the same hallway, they told reporters that Russia is the real problem, putting on full display the GOP divide on the issue. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham -- in a notable break from the President -- sharply disputed Trump and other Republicans pushing the Ukraine theory. ""That is not true,"" Graham said. ""They didn't. It was the Russians. I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else."" The South Carolina Republican said he has seen media reports of a possible connection between Ukraine and the hacked Democratic National Committee emails but added, ""No one from the intelligence community has ever told me that happened.""Republican Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana said the US would be making a mistake if it shifted its attention to Ukraine when Russia was responsible for the election interference.""I think Sen. Kennedy is firm in his belief that they had some impact. To me, don't take your eye off Russia. That's where I think we need to focus,"" he said. ""They clearly have the capability and intent and will be there in some way every election down the road to the extent that they can penetrate the system.""Some GOP senators -- including several up for reelection in states where Trump is popular -- were noncommittal, leaving themselves room to support the President's theories. Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas who is on the Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Monday that he's inclined to believe Ukraine might have been involved. ""I believe there was some open-source reporting to the effect there were actors in Ukraine actively encouraging the Clinton campaign,"" he said, referring to news reports. ""There is a lot of intrigue that happens behind the curtains. I guess I would not be surprised if that were true.""Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, said, ""I would tend to believe that Russia would do something like that.""But pressed on whether the Ukrainians hadn't interfered, she wouldn't declare one way or another. ""We have not been briefed on that so I would have no way of knowing that, yes or no,"" she said. At a news conference, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was questioned about the divide in his party and asked ""to set the record straight.""McConnell, the longest-serving Republican Senate majority leader in history, has a well-earned reputation for saying exactly what he wants and not a drop more. Up for reelection in red Kentucky, he also knows how to avoid saying anything critical of certain subjects that are important to the President, like whether or not Ukraine interfered. At first McConnell seemed to answer an unrelated question about the impeachment inquiry in the House before eventually being steered back by a second reporter to the original question, though McConnell still masterfully avoided providing clarity on his views about Ukraine. ""That is something for the Intelligence Committee to look at, if they choose to. And I don't have any particular reaction to it,"" he said. As Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is second-ranking to McConnell in GOP leadership, left that same news conference, he was asked why his party was divided on the issue. While he didn't answer that part of the question, he made clear he believes Ukraine was not involved. ""All I know is that the intelligence community and the Intelligence Committee here has concluded conclusively that it was the Russians,"" he said. ""So, that's what I know and believe to be true. I have not seen any evidence that it was anybody else.""Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he knows why Republican are split: ""Obeisance to Trump.""""This was a right-wing conspiracy theory and we're in a new time here,"" the New York Democrat said. ""I'm just aghast that my Republican colleagues, you know, in obeisance to Trump, we know will say anything, whether it's true or not, just embrace it. It's appalling and it's shameful on them.""CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report."
Fact-checking Rudy Giuliani's newest allegations from his Ukraine trip,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/rudy-giuliani-new-ukraine-conspiracies-fact-check/index.html,"Giuliani, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into the President, tweeted out Thursday evening and into Friday morning several allegations over US aid to Ukraine and supposed stand-down orders directed from the US embassy in Ukraine to the country's police force.""The Accounts Chamber in Ukraine found an alleged misuse of $5.3B in U.S. funds during the Obama administration while Biden was 'Point Man,'"" Giuliani tweeted Thursday night. ""Obama embassy urged Ukrainian police NOT to investigate!""The next morning Giuliani tweeted the same allegations, this time naming former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch -- who Giuliani worked to have removed from her post -- and adding a new conspiracy that ""much of the $5.3B in US Aid Ukraine reported as misused was given to the embassy's favored NGO's.""Facts First: The $5.3 billion figure comes from multiple countries, not solely from the US, and funds to non-government organizations represents a small percentage of this aid. The Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported that there was not a proper accounting of the funds and their designated projects, not that the funds were ""misused."" And there is no evidence to support the accusation that the US embassy ""urged Ukrainian police NOT to investigate."" Foreign aid During his trip to Ukraine this week, Giuliani met with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach Thursday, who -- days prior -- provided Giuliani with documents on foreign aid to Ukraine. Activists and anti-corruption experts describe Derkach as a politician with suspect political motives. His father was the head of Ukraine's security services under President Leonid Kuchma. The younger Derkach's biography states he attended the Academy of the Ministry of Security of Russia in the early 90s, also known as the academy of the FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB.In a letter sent Tuesday from Derkach to Giuliani, Derkach -- after flattering Giuliani as a promoter of ""justice, freedom and other American values"" and a fighter against corruption -- mentioned (and provided copies of) a 2017 report from the Accounting Chamber to draw Giuliani's ""attention to the facts of the inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer's funds.""It's here that Derkach points to the $5.3 billion in foreign aid, which he mentions span across 390 projects in Ukraine. The 2017 report from Ukraine's Accounting Chamber, however, does not state that these funds were misused as Giuliani claims, but rather that there was not a ""proper and complete accounting of the projects"" due to a lack of solid regulatory framework in the government. NGOsSergey Fursa, a financial expert in Kiev and analyst for Dragon Capital, told CNN that the category in the report which likely encompasses NGOs represents ""only 6 percent of total funding"" whereas ""70 percent of the funds went towards nuclear power stations security and military support which are large government-controlled programs."" Out of the $5.3, the US provided 27 percent, approximately $1.4 billion,  according to the report.US Embassy  Giuliani presented no evidence to support his claim that the US embassy in Ukraine ordered police there not to investigate this theoretical (and unfounded) misuse of US aid. Given that the report does not claim a ""misuse"" of the $5.3 billion in foreign aid, it doesn't make sense that the US embassy would direct police in Ukraine not to investigate something that never was.  In his tweet, Giuliani noted that ""at the time"" of these supposed events, ""Yovanovitch, witness for the Witchunt, was the [US Ambassador to Ukraine]."" This is not the first time Giuliani has gone after Yovanovitch. In her testimony to the House Intelligence Committee during the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch said that she became aware of a campaign to get her removed from her post and that it was led by Rudy Giuliani and Yuriy Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General who was also behind Giuliani's debunked claims against the Bidens.One part of this campaign to remove the ambassador was the accusation from Lutsenko that Yovanovitch created a ""Do Not Prosecute"" list for the Ukrainian government of individuals exempt from investigations into corruption. Yovanovitch testified that Lutsenko later retracted this claim and the State Department called it an ""outright fabrication."""
Kentucky governor restores former felons' voting rights,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/kentucky-governor-andy-beshear-restores-felon-voting-rights/index.html,"""My faith teaches me to treat others with dignity and respect. My faith also teaches forgiveness and that is why I am restoring voting rights to over one hundred forty thousand Kentuckians who have done wrong in the past, but are doing right now,""  Beshear, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""I want to lift up all of our families and I believe we have a moral responsibility to protect and expand the right to vote.""Beshear also lamented the state's voter access issues, asserting that Kentucky has the third highest voter disenfranchisement rate nationwide with nearly 10% of people, and nearly 25% of African-Americans, in the state not being allowed to vote.The move fulfills a campaign promise after Beshear's upset victory over former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in November. It was a key point in Beshear's platform of progressive issues, including making Medicaid more accessible and replacing Bevin's state board of education.The order states that more than 140,000 Kentuckians were unable to vote despite completing their prison terms for non-violent felonies, and that Kentucky was one of two states that did not automatically restore voting rights to former felons. The order does not apply to those incarcerated for treason, bribery in an election and many violent offenses.Voting rights measures coming from the governor's office have been a point of contention in Kentucky across several administrations. Beshear's father, former Gov. Steve Beshear, issued an executive order in 2015 restoring felons' voting rights. But Bevin promptly reversed it with his own executive order upon taking office later that year.Bevin said at the time that while he supported ""the automatic restoration of civil rights"" for qualifying former felons, he believed ""that such restoration must come through an amendment to the Kentucky Constitution and not by executive action.""Under the Kentucky Constitution, those with felony convictions lose their voting rights but ""may be restored to their civil rights by executive pardon.""Kentucky is not alone in vacillating on the issue. Last year, Florida restored voting rights to over 1 million former felons through a ballot initiative. But earlier this year, the state's House passed a bill that would make it harder for ex-felons to vote by requiring that they pay all financial obligations to the state before heading to the polls, a measure that opponents have likened to a ""poll tax."""
Nancy Pelosi quietly gauges Democrats' temperature over impeaching Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-plans/index.html,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will answer questions during a live CNN town hall moderated by Jake Tapper, Thursday at 9 pm ET. (CNN)Speaker Nancy Pelosi is having a steady stream of private conversations with her colleagues to get their input about whether they're ready to impeach President Donald Trump and what they think should be included in articles of impeachment, according to multiple Democrats familiar with the matter.Pelosi, who will make the ultimate decision on the scope of the articles and the schedule for impeachment, has publicly and privately been coy for weeks about her plans, saying she would let the process play out and refusing to put a time frame on a final vote. But Pelosi's recent conversations show that the House is nearing a crucial moment that will define Trump's presidency and could have long-lasting ramifications for the country.Several Democrats who have spoken with the California Democrat say she is not trying to project her views about what the articles should look like but is hearing out her colleagues instead. And those conversations are expected to inform her thinking as she makes her final decision, allowing members to feel like they've had input on her decision making -- including on articles of impeachment.It's a strategy Pelosi has employed throughout her speakership, including when she announced in late September that there should be an impeachment inquiry, after a majority of her caucus had announced their support for one. Similarly, now a vast majority of Democrats want Trump impeached and are waiting for Pelosi to give the final blessing before action is taken to make Trump the third American president to be impeached by the House.""She doesn't follow parades,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia. ""She leads them.""Going behind closed doors on Wednesday with House Democrats to discuss the next steps of the proceedings, Pelosi tried to convey a sense of seriousness. She would not allow staff in the room, while members were instructed to leave their cell phones in cubbyholes.And as she went before her members, Pelosi said: ""Are you ready?""Her question focused on whether her caucus was ready to keep moving forward on the next steps on impeachment, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Democrats in the room were vocal with their unequivocal answer: Yes.Pelosi then offered her counsel to her colleagues: Be disciplined in your messaging and recognize that members all serve different districts with different constituencies, sources said.""There is no anxiety on this thing, I can tell you that right now,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey, said after the meeting. ""We're not happy we're at this point or doing this. It's got to be done, though. That's our oath of office, and we will do it."" How the articles of impeachment will be structured will ultimately be Pelosi's call. But she is working closely with some of her closest confidants and chairs of key committees, particularly House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York, who declared Wednesday night that Trump has committed ""impeachable offenses.""Among the articles that Democrats are considering: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. But a key question remains on whether to include evidence gleaned from the Mueller probe as part of an article of impeachment or leave the focus strictly on the Ukraine scandal that has imperiled Trump's presidency.Democrats are working under the assumption that the House Judiciary Committee will have votes as soon as next week on the articles of impeachment, which would be followed by a vote on the full House floor the week after, finishing up before Christmas.Yet Pelosi has so far declined to say.As she returned from an official trip to Spain with her colleagues, Pelosi on Tuesday wouldn't reveal to her closest lieutenants where she stood. Indeed, House Democrats on her leadership team had some key questions on their minds Tuesday evening during a private meeting in the basement of the Capitol with Pelosi.Where did she stand on impeachment?  What would the articles look like? When would votes occur?Pelosi, several sources said, was true to form, revealing very little.She wouldn't specify any sort of timeline, didn't lay out the scope of the articles -- and indicated to her colleagues that it wasn't even clear yet if the House would, in fact, impeach Trump.Her message: Let the process play out.""No, we haven't made it,"" Pelosi claimed to CNN when asked Tuesday night if she had made a decision on impeachment.At a crucial juncture in the proceedings, and with the country bitterly divided, the speaker has been seeking to project an image of a House Democratic majority that is reluctant to impeach Trump. And even as she's endorsed every key decision of the fast-moving probe in the House, she is trying to balance the desire to wrap up the proceedings quickly with not getting ahead of vulnerable Democrats still nervous about impeachment.For months, Pelosi resisted moving forward on an impeachment inquiry even after many House Democrats were loudly demanding it in the aftermath of the Mueller report detailing episodes of the President allegedly seeking to undercut the investigation into his campaign and his presidency. But she changed her tune in the aftermath of revelations that Trump had urged the Ukrainians to investigate his political rivals, prompting her late September announcement calling for an impeachment inquiry. Yet even as the probe has revealed more damaging information about Trump's conduct, she still steadfastly refuses to say he should be impeached or to detail her plans.That has given some of her colleagues space, like vulnerable Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.Sherrill, a New Jersey freshman who backed an impeachment inquiry, citing national security concerns over the President's conduct with Ukraine, told CNN on Wednesday that she has stayed in touch with Pelosi.Asked if Pelosi is handling the impeachment process well right now, Sherrill said: ""We'll see. I think the end result will determine that.""But she added: ""One thing that I wanted was a sober, thoughtful process. This is not a road we had hoped to go down. I would say that the President's conduct really left us no other choice. But I do think it is not something that should be taken lightly, and I've been happy with the seriousness which the caucus has approached and which the speaker has approached.""Freshman Rep. Max Rose, a Democrat from a swing district in New York, said he didn't have any concerns about the lack of clarity from Pelosi, saying he's concerned only about seeing a drug pricing measure and infrastructure bill passed.""I don't give a s--t about timelines for anything else besides those things,"" Rose said.""I do not feel like we should be pushing this any faster than what the facts tell us to do,"" he added of impeachment. ""That's what matters.""This story has been updated with more information after the hearlng."
Barr slams FBI as he and Durham contradict watchdog,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/barr-ig-watchdog-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Attorney General William Barr and the US attorney he picked to lead a probe into the origins of the Russia investigation criticized the FBI on Monday and contradicted some of the key findings of a report by the Justice Department's inspector general.Barr excoriated the FBI for launching what he called an ""intrusive investigation"" into a presidential campaign based on the ""thinnest of suspicions.""The Justice Department's inspector general found that the FBI properly opened its investigation into Russian election interference but said there were major errors in how the agency conducted the probe.The distance between Barr and the inspector general on one of the report's most critical findings marked a striking contrast, and appeared to create space for President Donald Trump and his defenders to argue that the Russia investigation and the special counsel investigation it spawned were fundamentally flawed. The move is reminiscent of Barr's actions around the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report when the attorney general sought to frame the results of that investigation in the best light possible for Trump.The report released Monday by Inspector General Michael Horowitz did not find ""documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions"" to open investigations that initially focused on Trump campaign advisers Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.John Durham, the US attorney who was handpicked by Barr to lead the separate probe, said that while he has the ""utmost respect"" for the inspector general's office, he disagreed with some of the report's findings.""I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff,"" Durham said in a statement. ""However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department. Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.""The FBI launched their counterintelligence investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials in July 2016. It was not until 2017 that the investigation was revealed publicly. Instead it was then-FBI director James Comey's announcement that the FBI would investigate more emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's private server that would end up rocking the election.Clinton later said she believes the decision cost her the presidency. The inspector general investigation, launched in early 2018, centered on a series of warrants the FBI filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as it sought to investigate Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign.The warrants stated that the FBI believed Page ""has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" according to redacted copies the bureau released last year.To bolster their request to the surveillance court, the FBI relied at times on claims about the 2016 Trump campaign collected in a dossier of unverified intelligence reports by former British spy Christopher Steele.Investigators from the watchdog office reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews as part of the probe. Horowitz will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 11 to discuss the findings of his report.Read Barr's full statement below:""Nothing is more important than the credibility and integrity of the FBI and the Department of Justice. That is why we must hold our investigators and prosecutors to the highest ethical and professional standards. The Inspector General's investigation has provided critical transparency and accountability, and his work is a credit to the Department of Justice. I would like to thank the Inspector General and his team.The Inspector General's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken. It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory. Nevertheless, the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump's administration. In the rush to obtain and maintain FISA surveillance of Trump campaign associates, FBI officials misled the FISA court, omitted critical exculpatory facts from their filings, and suppressed or ignored information negating the reliability of their principal source. The Inspector General found the explanations given for these actions unsatisfactory. While most of the misconduct identified by the Inspector General was committed in 2016 and 2017 by a small group of now-former FBI officials, the malfeasance and misfeasance detailed in the Inspector General's report reflects a clear abuse of the FISA process.FISA is an essential tool for the protection of the safety of the American people. The Department of Justice and the FBI are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to rectify the abuses that occurred and to ensure the integrity of the FISA process going forward.No one is more dismayed about the handling of these FISA applications than Director Wray. I have full confidence in Director Wray and his team at the FBI, as well as the thousands of dedicated line agents who work tirelessly to protect our country. I thank the Director for the comprehensive set of proposed reforms he is announcing today, and I look forward to working with him to implement these and any other appropriate measures.With respect to DOJ personnel discussed in the report, the Department will follow all appropriate processes and procedures, including as to any potential disciplinary action.""This story has been updated with additional details.CNN's David Shortell contributed to this report.

How constitutional scholars talk when they talk about the Constitution,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/constitutional-scholars-language-impeachment-analysis/index.html,"Washington (CNN)They brought solemn warnings but were ready to crack wise. They quoted the Constitution's framers, Sir Thomas More and contemporary pols. They invoked everyday hypotheticals but also a supposed afterlife conversation with Alexander Hamilton. And as they expressed anger and fear, they wove in personal tales of a mail-order Thanksgiving turkey and an unhappy goldendoodle.               It was Con Law 101 or, in the parlance of today's popular instructional manuals, Impeachment for Dummies, offered by four law professors known for distilling difficult concepts to academic audiences and a broader public through their commentary and analysis. Even if their testimony on Wednesday changed not one mind on polarized Capitol Hill, their explications offered a national television audience a short course in the constitutional provision dictating that a president may be removed from office through House impeachment and Senate conviction for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  The professors were divided in their assessments of whether President Donald Trump should be impeached for his dealings with Ukraine. For impeachment were Harvard's Noah Feldman, University of North Carolina's Michael Gerhardt and Stanford's Pamela Karlan, all invited by the committee's Democratic majority. Speaking against a Trump impeachment was George Washington University's Jonathan Turley, selected by the Republican minority. Yet all four were united in a message about the weight of the moment: However the US House of Representatives acts on the presidential matter at hand, it will affect America's constitutional checks and balances for decades to come. They all also understood they had to make their arguments as accessible as they were urgent. They streamlined their renditions of history and sprinkled their remarks with analogies and pop culture references. By and large, they avoided legal jargon and dense responses.   Karlan tried to bring closer to home the claims that Trump wanted to trade US security assistance to Ukraine for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a possible Democratic rival to Trump's reelection, and Biden's son Hunter. ""Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding,"" Karlan said. ""What would you think if, when your governor asked the federal government for the disaster assistance that Congress has provided, the President responded, 'I would like you to do us a favor. I'll meet with you and send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.' Wouldn't you know in your gut that such a President had abused his office?"" Gerhardt, who is also a CNN contributor, argued that it would not matter that a presidential scheme was not fully executed, just as a bank robber who drops the money as he flees the scene would still be responsible for an offense.All told, there was no professorial hemming and hawing, no on-the-one-hand and on-the-other. The four were forceful in their positions and not cowed by questioning from House members who opposed witnesses' views. In the professors' day jobs, they face the challenge of engaging drowsy students. On Wednesday, they faced cameras, banks of microphones and more than eight hours or scrutiny. ""We got law professors here,"" Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins said with evident sarcasm early on. ""What a start of a party."" 'No one is king'Wednesday's session marked the start of the House Judiciary Committee's role in the impeachment inquiry, following the House Intelligence Committee hearings and newly issued report. Under the Constitution, the House has the sole power to impeach a President. If that occurs, it is the responsibility of the Senate to hold a trial to decide to convict or acquit the President of impeachment charges. An overriding point of contention is whether Trump's conduct rises to the level of an impeachable offense, a debate tailor-made for law professors. Sitting at a long wooden desk, the four beckoned their audiences back to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the roots of why the framers even wrote an impeachment provision into the Constitution. It was, in the words of one founder, ""an essential security for the good behavior of the Executive.""Feldman spoke emphatically, looking from one side of the committee dais to the other as he addressed House members. As abstract as any of the impeachment terms might seem today, he observed, ""the words high crimes and misdemeanors represented very specific language that was well understood by the entire generation of the framers ... borrowed from an impeachment trial in England that was taking place as the framers were speaking."" He said the words referred ""to the abuse of the office of the presidency for personal advantage, or to corrupt the electoral process, or to subvert the national security of the United States.""Turley, the witness called by the Republican members, said he believed the evidence against the President had come up short for impeachment. He warned that the current ordeal would shape the power of presidents for generations, and he stressed that he was not a supporter of Trump.The Democratic witnesses especially highlighted the founders' worries of foreign interference and fear of the absolute power held by the crown. ""Our hearing today should serve as a reminder of one of the fundamental principles that drove the founders of our Constitution to break from England and to draft their own Constitution,"" Gerhardt said. ""The principle that in this country, no one is king."" Feldman added that an abuse of office occurs ""when the President uses a feature of his power ... not to serve the interests of the American public but to serve his personal, individual, partisan electoral interests."" All four tried to leaven the heavy historical citations, sometimes with references to their families or even meals. Karlan said she had spent her Thanksgiving vacation poring over materials related to the impeachment inquiry, eating a pre-cooked turkey that arrived in the mail. In her opening comments, she chastised Collins for presuming the law professors had not read the House Intelligence Committee report that had been released a day earlier: ""I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts, so I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts."" Her remarks were, by turns, fiery, folksy and edgy. She has a reputation for lacing her legal arguments with popular references. FOr example, in October, when she argued a case before the Supreme Court on behalf of gay workers who had been fired, she referred to a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch.At one point in Wednesday's hearing, she appeared to cross a line. Observing that the Constitution disallows any titles of nobility, she said, ""the President can name his son Barron, but he can't make him a baron."" First lady Melania Trump condemned Karlan on Twitter as infringing on her son's privacy and, at the hearing, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz told Karlan the remark made her ""look mean."" Karlan apologized later in the hearing. Turley may have best captured the mood in the room and in America. ""I get it,"" he said, as he tried to make the case that the House impeachment moves were premature. ""You are mad. The President's mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad, and Luna is a goldendoodle and they don't get mad. We are all mad -- and where has it taken us?""But anger cannot justify an impeachment, Turley said: ""Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad? Will it only invite an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration? That is why this is wrong."""
The Point: Donald Trump now has an obvious path to a second term,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/donald-trump-economic-numbers/index.html,"Yes, you can quibble about whether the strong November report or the upward revisions in job gains for the last two months or the broader upswing in the economy is due to Trump and his policies. But what we know -- both from our political history and more recent polling -- is that presidents get credit when the economy is strong and blame when it is weak.In a CNN poll released late last month, Trump's overall job approval was a less-than-stellar 42% while a majority -- 54% -- disapproved. But those numbers were reversed when people were asked what they thought of Trump's handling of the economy. On that question, 52% approved while 40% disapproved. (It was the only area in the poll where a majority of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing.)The simple fact is that a) the economy is strong and b) lots of people give Trump credit for that fact.In a series of tweets on Friday -- both before and after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its October jobs numbers -- Trump championed his economic successes.""Without the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems!"" wrote Trump, adding the hashtag ""2020.""  Earlier Friday, he had tweeted this:""Stock Markets Up Record Numbers. For this year alone, Dow up 18.65%, S&P up 24.36%, Nasdaq Composite up 29.17%. 'It's the economy, stupid.'""That famous phrase -- coined by Democratic strategist James Carville during his work for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign -- had to send a shiver down the spine of Democratic strategists Friday morning when the news of the stunningly positive jobs report broke. Because, well, it's been proven right over and over again. Incumbent presidents don't lose often. When they do, it's usually because the economy is perceived to be weak or faltering. Take Jimmy Carter, who saw the unemployment and inflation rates soar during his time in office and watched as Ronald Reagan promised to turn things around. Or George H.W. Bush, whose sky-high poll numbers during the first Gulf War collapsed amid an economic recession and delivered the White House to Clinton. The only other president in the last nine decades to lose a bid for reelection was Gerald Ford -- and that was due in large part to his decision to pardon the man he replaced in office: Richard Nixon.The data then is clear: It's very, very hard to beat an incumbent president unless the economy is seen by a majority of the public to be weakening badly.It makes sense. In election after election, voters cite the economy as the most important issue affecting their vote. In 2016, 52% said the economy was the most pressing issue in the country, according to exit polling. Terrorism placed second on that list with just 18% saying it was the most critical issue. In the 2012 presidential election, almost six in 10 voters (59%) said that the economy was the most important issue. More than six in 10 (63%) named the economy as the most important issue in the country in the 2008 election.So given that voters care most -- by a lot -- about the economy, it makes sense that if they believe a President is doing a good job on the economy they are inclined to reelect that person to keep it going.Which would suggest that Trump is going to cruise to a second term. Except that he is Trump.What does that mean exactly? Two things, as it relates to this conversation:1) Trump's approval numbers on the economy have been strong for much of the past few years -- and yet his overall job approval numbers haven't ever come close to showing that a majority approve of the job he is doing overall.2) Trump is uniquely incapable of staying on message. If he was relentless in his focus on the state of the economy between now and next November, he would undoubtedly make it more likely he wins a second term. But Trump has demonstrated -- throughout his presidency and his life -- that he lacks the attention span and/or discipline to stay on any message at all.In years and decades past, any president overseeing a flourishing economy would have a massive leg up in their reelection bid. Trump, of course, isn't just ""any"" president -- mostly in ways that negatively impact his chances of winning next November.But these latest economic numbers make one thing very clear: The economy is Trump's, um, trump card with voters -- if only he knows how and when to play it."
Analysis: New evidence raises the question: Is Nunes an investigator or participant in Ukraine affair?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/nunes-ukraine-controversy/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, was closer to the central figures in the Ukraine scandal than he let on, even as his committee investigated the matter, according to congressional findings and news reports.A sweeping report from House Democrats indicated that Nunes and a top aide exchanged multiple phone calls, at key moments, with President Donald Trump's allies who were digging up dirt in Ukraine about Trump's political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden. The new developments create a strange and unprecedented twist in which a sitting lawmaker, let alone the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, is embroiled in the very matter the committee is investigating. It's unclear what role Nunes played -- at the least, he's a potential witness; at worst, he's an active participant.Phone records subpoenaed by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee indicate that Nunes was in contact with Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associate Lev Parnas at a time when they were soliciting damaging information about Biden from Ukrainian officials.House Democrats have also accused Giuliani of coordinating with Trump to pressure Ukraine's president into announcing an investigation into Biden, which would help Trump's 2020 campaign. Along the way, Giuliani and Nunes publicly promoted many of the debunked theories about Biden.Nunes, a California Republican, was already fending off accusations from Democrats that he played a role in the scheme. And Parnas, through his attorney, previously told CNN that Nunes spoke directly with some of the Ukrainians, and that one of his senior aides, Derek Harvey, participated in strategy sessions with Giuliani.Taken together, the revelations from the past few weeks make it clear that Nunes was much closer than previously known to Giuliani and Parnas, who are both under criminal investigation.Nunes has disputed some claims about his ties to Ukrainians, specifically that he visited Vienna last year to meet a former Ukrainian prosecutor who offered dirt on the Bidens. Nunes denied meeting the ex-official, Viktor Shokin, in a defamation lawsuit he filed against CNN this week. Phone calls and strategy sessionsEarlier this year, Giuliani held regular strategy sessions to discuss his Ukraine plans at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, according to Parnas' lawyer Joseph Bondy. These meetings included Parnas, conservative columnist John Solomon and Republican attorneys Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, CNN previously reported.  Parnas said that Nunes aide Harvey occasionally attended, and that Parnas understood Harvey was there as Nunes' proxy, Bondy told CNN. Phone records disclosed in the Democratic report indicate that Parnas and Harvey had at least three phone calls in February, though the content of their conversations is unknown. This was the first official confirmation of a link between Parnas and Harvey. The phone records also suggest that many who attended those meetings at Trump's hotel remained in regular contact throughout the spring, when Solomon started publishing columns in The Hill containing conspiracy theories about the Bidens.The phone records indicate that Nunes connected with Giuliani on April 10. That same week, the phone records show that Giuliani was also in touch with Parnas and Solomon, who had just published two new columns. The Democratic report also highlighted a flurry of activity on April 12, when there were phone calls between a number of parties: Giuliani and an unidentified White House number, Parnas and Giuliani, Parnas and Solomon, and also Parnas and Nunes. The records indicate that on one of those calls, Parnas and Nunes spoke for longer than eight minutes, though it's still unknown what they discussed.Nunes says he has never met Parnas, but played coy about the extent of their relationship.""You know, it's possible,"" Nunes said Tuesday on Fox News, on whether he ever spoke to Parnas. ""But I haven't gone through all my phone records. I don't really recall that name. You know, I remember the name now because he has been indicted... I will go back and check all my records, but it seems very unlikely that I would be taking calls from random people.""One month after Nunes' alleged calls with Parnas, Giuliani spoke with Harvey, according to phone records from May 8. That call happened as Giuliani was preparing to travel to Ukraine to potentially meet with Shokin and some of the officials who were peddling the questionable theories in Solomon's columns. Giuliani nixed the trip after his plans were revealed in the press and Trump weighed in.The Daily Beast also reported that another Parnas lawyer claimed that his client helped arrange meetings and phone calls for Nunes in Europe. That lawyer, Ed MacMahon, also said Harvey attended some of these overseas meetings, which were for Nunes' investigative work. Harvey did not comment when reached by CNN for previous stories about Ukrainian meetings. ""If this story is correct, the Ranking Member (Nunes) may have actually been projecting and in fact he may be the fact witness if he is working with indicted individuals around our investigation,"" Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said at an impeachment hearing last month. The Democratic report directly accused Nunes and the others of having these conversations, based on the records subpoenaed from Verizon and AT&T, which is the parent company of CNN. But the report did not disclose the actual phone numbers, only the duration and alleged participants. Conspiracies take center stageMany of Solomon's columns included unsubstantiated claims that Biden abused his powers to protect his son's position on the board of Burisma, and that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election to help Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Nearly all of these theories have been recanted, debunked or discredited by witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, said ""all the key elements"" of the columns ""were false.""But that didn't stop Nunes from repeating many of them at nearly every public hearing held by the House Intelligence Committee.""The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling and they defend Hunter Biden's securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company, all while his father served as vice president,"" Nunes said at the first public impeachment hearing November 13.After declaring the inquiry ""a direct-to-TV sequel to the Russia collusion hoax"" at another hearing, Nunes posed questions about Biden: ""Why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden? And what did he do for them? And did his position impact any U.S. government actions under the Obama administration?"" The answers to Nunes' queries have been readily available -- while questions of ethics and judgment remain, no evidence has emerged implicating Biden in corruption or abusing his office. The US intelligence community believes that some of the theories Nunes endorsed, especially that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election, actually originated from Russian operatives as part of an orchestrated disinformation campaign, CNN has reported. For months, Giuliani fanned the flames on Fox News and in regular Twitter posts, where he accused Biden and other Democrats of crimes. Just this week, Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to meet with some of the same former officials, including Shokin, who peddled the theories about Biden in the first place. What's next for Nunes?Nunes is no stranger to controversy. He was forced to step back from running the committee's Russia inquiry in 2017 after he was caught coordinating with the White House to undermine the inquiry.This time around, Nunes is dangerously close to the scandal yet again. During the hearings, Nunes repeatedly chided Democrats because they allegedly ""got campaign dirt from Ukrainians in the 2016 election."" Now his own interest in obtaining information from foreign sources is under scrutiny. Republicans also used the House Intelligence Committee hearings to turn the tables on its Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California. They accused Schiff of coordinating with the US intelligence community whistleblower who first raised concerns about Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower was in touch with committee staff, but not with any members, before filing the complaint.  Nunes maintains he didn't do anything wrong and praised Giuliani for his exploits in Ukraine. ""It would be dereliction of duty for the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to not go to Ukraine to figure out what on earth were the Democrats doing in Ukraine, paying for dirt from Ukrainian officials to dirty up the Trump campaign in 2016,"" Nunes said on Fox News last month. ""It would also be dereliction of duty for me and my committee not to be meeting with Ukrainians.""Federal prosecutors might see things differently. They've already indicted Parnas, who was arrested in October while boarding a flight to Vienna with a one-way ticket. He is accused of using straw donors to hide campaign contributions to a pro-Trump super PAC and of helping funnel foreign money into US state elections. He has pleaded not guilty.That investigation continues and prosecutors said this week that additional charges are likely. CNN reported that investigators are probing Giuliani's financial ties to Parnas and his overseas dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere and have talked to witnesses and issued subpoenas.Prosecutors said they seized nearly 30 electronic devices from Parnas and his co-defendants and are still trying to crack the passwords. This would give investigators access to thousands of emails and text messages, perhaps including some communications with Nunes or Harvey.On Tuesday, Schiff sidestepped direct questions about Nunes' links to the Ukraine scheme. But while presenting the findings of his 300-page report, Schiff indirectly raised the alarm about Nunes' potential conduct.""It is deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity,"" Schiff said, alluding to his colleague Nunes.CNN's Olanma Mang and Kara Scannell contributed to this story."
Trump drama turns NATO gathering into a diplomatic soap opera,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/nato-2019-key-moments/index.html,"London (CNN)If allied leaders had hoped that US President Donald Trump's presence at a summit in the London area marking the 70th anniversary of the alliance this week would promote unity among old friends they probably left disappointed.Trump's visit was marked by showdowns between leaders, lengthy and freewheeling appearances by the President before the media, an abrupt news conference cancellation and an extraordinary row over a viral video. Trump's relationship with NATO Trump has long challenged and pushed NATO members to spend more on defense and has even suggested the alliance is obsolete. Ahead of the summit he successfully cut the US contribution to NATO's budget. At this year's gathering Trump seemed to play good cop-bad cop on NATO's role. Before his opening breakfast with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday he complained ""NATO has not treated us fairly ... they pay far too little.""However, at times he seemed to defend the alliance. He was especially vocal about French President Emmanuel Macron's recent description of NATO as suffering from ""brain death,"" due, in part, to a lack of US leadership under Trump. Alongside Stoltenberg Trump called Macron's comments ""dangerous,"" ""nasty"" and ""insulting."" He also suggested France may exit NATO. And on Wednesday Trump said the alliance is ""very important."" ""NATO is very important. It was not good but it has gone to a very strong position. We had a really good day and a good day yesterday,"" Trump said. Clashes with MacronBut Macron was in no mood to back down from his comments about the state of NATO. ""I know that my statements created some reaction,"" he said alongside Trump on Tuesday. ""I do stand by [them].""There was another tense moment during their meeting when Trump was asked whether France had committed to taking back foreign fighters from Syria.Trump said the matter hadn't come up yet but jokingly asked Macron, ""Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I could give them to you. You could take every one you want.""""Let's be serious,"" Macron responded, adding that the number one priority is to defeat ISIS. ""It's not yet done. I'm sorry to say that.""Later that evening, though, the pair were spotted arriving together at a reception hosted at 10 Downing Street. Macron had evidently hitched a ride with Trump in his motorcade vehicle. The following day, Trump claimed Macron had ""taken back"" his critical comments on NATO.""Speaking to the President of France yesterday we had a good meeting and he's taken back his comments very much so on NATO,"" Trump said. It's unclear whether Macron agrees with Trump's assessment. The hot micsThere were not one but two notable hot mic moments at the gathering. Macron was recorded alongside other world leaders at a Tuesday evening reception at Buckingham Palace, appearing to joke about Trump's behavior earlier in the day.The 25-second clip, first reported by Canadian Broadcasting Corp., begins with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking Macron why he was late.""Is that why you were late?"" Johnson asked.Macron nodded, as Trudeau replied, ""He was late because he takes a ... 40-minute press conference at the top.""Trudeau admitted Wednesday that he and other leaders in the conversation were speaking about Trump's lengthy press availabilities during the summit. At another point in the conversation captured on the recording, Trudeau said, ""You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""The Canadian prime minister said that in reference to Trump's announcement during their bilateral meeting that the upcoming G7 summit will be hosted at Camp David.""Every different leader has teams who now and then (had) jaws drop at unscheduled surprises, like that video itself, for example,"" Trudeau said.Johnson also weighed in on the recording Wednesday, saying it was ""nonsense"" to suggest the jokes made in the video indicated he didn't take Trump seriously.""I don't know where that's come from,"" he added.Reacting to the video, Trump called Trudeau ""two faced,"" and canceled a scheduled news conference at the end of Wednesday. At an event following those comments, Trump was caught on a hot mic of his own, saying, ""Oh, and then you know what they'll say. 'He didn't do a press conference. He didn't do a press conference.' That was funny when I said the guy's two-faced, you know that.""Trump's 2020 strategyEven at a gathering to discuss geopolitical challenges politics seemed to be front of mind for Trump.The President attended a lucrative fundraiser with wealthy Americans residing in London in between meetings ahead of the NATO summit on Tuesday.The White House billed the event, which was closed to the press, as ""a roundtable with supporters"" and a Republican source familiar with the event's plans tells CNN that the fundraiser was hosted by Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee run by the Republican National Committee and Trump's campaign.And throughout the summit Trump highlighted what he sees as potential political wins while magnifying what he sees as wrongdoing by Democratic foes.Trump emphasized his foreign policy successes, including increased defense spending among NATO members and the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.At some points, he insisted that he wasn't thinking about impeachment but it was clearly on his mind. He dismissed Democrats' impeachment inquiry multiple times during the summit.He also seemed to grapple with whether it would be better to sign a trade deal with China before or after the 2020 election.""In some ways, I think it's better to wait until after the election. I just think that. In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election,"" Trump said alongside Stoltenberg.CNN's Allie Malloy and Betsy Klein contributed to this report."
Former official says Trump often refused to believe his intelligence briefings,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/susan-gordon-trump-intel-briefings/index.html," (CNN)One of President Donald Trump's most common responses to intelligence briefings is to doubt what he's being told, former Deputy Director of Intelligence Susan Gordon said Tuesday.  Gordon, an intelligence veteran of more than 30 years, said Monday that Trump had two typical responses to briefings. ""One, 'I don't think that's true,'"" Gordon told the Women's Foreign Policy Group. ""The one is 'I'm not sure I believe that,'"" Gordon continued, ""and the other is the second order and third order effects. 'Why is that true? Why are we there? Why is this what you believe? Why do we do that?' Those sorts of things.""Gordon's remarks about the President at the group's gathering may be her first since Trump veered from protocol to block her from rising to become the acting director of national intelligence after the July resignation of Dan Coats. 'Adjudicate the sources'Gordon seemed to suggest that it was more difficult trying to figure out where the President had gotten the information that was shaping his beliefs and opinions than dealing with his tendency to doubt what he was being told. Speaking of Trump's disbelief, Gordon said, ""Remember, intelligence is fundamentally a craft of uncertainty and of possibility, so that doesn't put you off. It's trying to catch up to how you adjudicate the sources that led him to believe that and how you respond to it.""Gordon's ouster came about because Trump, who has had a contentious relationship with his own intelligence services, wanted a political loyalist in the role who would ""rein in"" the intelligence agencies. Coats had had a fraught relationship with Trump, providing assessments of Russia, North Korea, ISIS and Iran that countered the President's preferred outlook. Coats also vociferously defended US intelligence agencies' findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections on Trump's behalf -- a finding that the President publicly disavowed in a 2018 public press conference as he stood beside Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Gordon said Tuesday that serving in the intelligence community had been the honor of a lifetime, calling it ""the greatest job ever."" ""Intelligence is a lovely discipline,"" she said, ""that all you have to do is pursue the truth as hard as you can and then represent it in a manner that policy can be formed.""Her career included briefing President Ronald Reagan as a 28-year-old, and that longevity in the field gave her some perspective on Trump compared to other presidents. She painted a picture of a commander in chief tightly focused on the economic aspects of national security issues. Trump's questioning, she said, had a ""disproportionately"" economic bent to it.  She also noted that Trump arrived in the White House without the framework or foundation that presidents usually have to understand and analyze intelligence reports. He was the first president ""in my experience that had no foundation or framework to understand what the limits of intelligence are, what the purpose of it was and the way that we discuss it,"" Gordon said, comparing it to ""like playing pickup basketball with one runner. Right, everyone else knows how the game moves and plays and you have one person that comes in and plays and is just so different. That that in of itself is just so different.""Trump ""asked different questions, he pursued the different -- he had different trusts,"" she said. 'No framework'Gordon suggested that the President's intelligence briefers not only faced a challenge because of Trump's lack of familiarity with the world of intelligence, but also because he consumes information and hears opinions that aren't as carefully vetted as an intelligence product. ""Because he is probably the first president that arrived with no framework and a world that has massively available information with infinite people offering opinion that oft-times sound the same, but in fact are grittier because they are -- they don't have to have the same standard,"" Gordon said. Since Trump ""is much more economic in the way that he sees the word and the intelligence community traditional is much more political, military, purposely so,"" Gordon said. ""We were scrambling a bit to try and produce intelligence that was foundationally useful for someone who is interested in making trades and deals."" Gordon said that she found Trump to be ""actually kind of a fun brief because he was interactive, he would challenge you."" The timing and length of briefings differed, Gordon said, and took place about ""two to three times a week religiously. I can't think of a week where we didn't have a session.""Sessions would ""always start out with us presenting a set of intelligence we thought either were relevant to what he was doing or we thought needed to be heard,"" she said. Briefings of ""somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour would be typical,"" she added.Gordon also outlined Trump's similarities with other presidents, starting with the fact that he gets intelligence briefings. ""It is a foundational piece of his morning, it is a foundational piece of NSC meetings, whether that was 20 years ago or now,"" she said, referring to the National Security Council. Gordon said all leaders find that ""intelligence is massively inconvenient. It actually typically steals some of the decision space of the president. So you are walking in there making things difficult because of what you are presenting. And you are limiting the choices because once it's heard it is heard and it exists.""She said another thing ""that every president for whom I have worked has wished"" is that ""intelligence can say things that it can't. Right, you wish that some piece of truth existed that would allow you to justify.""Gordon said that every president is different and consumes intelligence differently.""President Obama was a reader and just voraciously consumed it. JFK wanted three by five cards in his pocket,"" she said. The task is ""to figure out how to convey the information, because it ultimately, that is what you are trying to do. You are trying to present information in a way that is both heard and then can be used.""Gordon said that ""because the role of intelligence is to ... provide wisdom, clarity and insight, you can't wish that the recipient were different from where they were. Your challenge is to present it in a way that it can be heard."""
The Point: Takeaways from the House's impeachment hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/impeachment-hearing-judiciary-committee-takeaways/index.html,"My rolling takeaways from the ongoing hearing -- which is expected to consume the entirety of Monday -- are below.This is all very hard to watchWithin the first hour of the hearing, Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, Republican ranking member Rep. Doug Collins and, among others, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz and Louisiana Republican Rep. Mike Johnson, repeatedly clashed over a) the very idea that the hearing was being held b) whether House minority rights were being violated and c) other legislative arcana that literally no one outside that committee room even understood.Gaetz, a major Trump supporter who has shown a knack for the spotlight, was, at one point, simply shouting at Nadler for holding the hearing at all -- and blasting the fact that staffers for both sides would be doing a lot of the talking during it. Nadler was clearly flustered on more than one occasion by the delay and stalling tactics used by Collins and others.The whole thing -- even for someone like me who gets paid to watch this stuff -- was, well, unwatchable. A bunch of adults yelling at one another over matters that almost no one watching understood or cares about. It's hard to see how either side benefits from any of this display. And here's the thing folks: All of this ugliness happened within the first hour of the hearings. Buckle up.Democrat portrays Trump as an active threat to democracyNadler used his opening statement to justify the tight time frame in which these impeachment hearings are being held. (Votes could come on the articles of impeachment as soon as later this week.) The New York Democrat's argument -- as he also argued in the first Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment -- is that the country can't afford to wait until after the next election to look into what Trump did in regard to Ukraine, because his track record suggests that he may well continue to seek foreign influence in the coming 2020 election.Nadler pointed out that while the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russians, the campaign was aware of the efforts and didn't discourage them. He also noted that Trump's efforts in Ukraine -- pushing for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden -- amounted to Trump seeking to put his thumb on the scale against his best-polling Democratic opponent in 2020.""The integrity of our elections is at stake,"" Nadler said.Republicans asked ""Where's Adam?""In keeping with their broader attacks on the process and their rights in the minority, Republicans -- led by Collins of Georgia -- focused heavily on the fact that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff refused to appear as a witness. Sitting in front of a ""Where's Adam?"" sign, Collins dedicated a large chunk of his opening statement to cast Schiff as a coward -- afraid to appear before his colleagues and defend the report that will be the basis of the articles of impeachment that are in the process of being written by the Judiciary Committee now.The goal here is simple: Use Schiff's absence as a telling sign that Democrats don't even really believe in what they are going to impeach the President on. Schiff won't even appear to defend himself!Schiff told CNN last month that there was ""nothing"" for him to testify about, adding that the Republican calls for him to do so mean ""they are not serious about what they are doing.""GOP goal looks to be to make people turn off the TVWith the morning session of the hearings complete, it appears to be that a goal -- if not the goal -- for Judiciary Committee Republicans is to get people to turn off the TV in disgust. As mentioned above, the level of high school cafeteria food fight is off the charts, with Republicans seeking to contest absolutely every element of the hearing -- up to and including Nadler's request for a 15-minute recess just before noon eastern time.Republicans clearly believe that the more disgust and frustration is sewn with the proceedings among the average voter, the better for them. The underlying theory of that belief goes like this: Trump was elected to disrupt Washington. The more people believe Congress -- especially the Democratic-controlled House -- is broken, dysfunctional and partisan, the easier the case is made that all of this impeachment stuff is just the establishment running scared.I will say this: If the goal is to make people turn off the TV in disgust, the first three hours of the hearing did a very good job of creating that feeling. So, good job -- or something.The false equivalency over who interfered in the 2016 election continuesHouse Republican counsel Steve Castor used his testimony to again call into question who actually meddled in the 2016 election and why. Castor argued that both Russia and Ukraine could have sought to interfere in the 2016 election -- citing as evidence the fact that some Ukrainian officials made clear in op-eds, personal Facebook posts and the like -- that they a) didn't like Trump and b) wanted Hillary Clinton to win.The problem for Castor is that the comparison collapses under even the smallest amount of scrutiny. What Russia did -- and we know all of this because of the findings of the intelligence community and the Mueller report -- was run a broad, coordinated effort of misinformation and persuasion to help Trump and hurt Clinton because they believed the billionaire businessman would be better for their long-term interests. A dozen Russian nationals were indicted by Mueller for their role in this scheme.To compare the sweeping efforts by the Russians to the writings of a handful of Ukrainian officials is simply disingenuous. What the two countries did is not even in the same universe.A witness turns into a questioner -- and Republicans lose itOn Monday morning, Barry Berke, lead counsel for House Democrats, served as a witness in the Judiciary Committee hearing into Trump's impeachment. He laid out the case that Trump had, in fact, abused his office by exerting his powers as President to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens. Which, OK.But then, when the afternoon session opened, Berke was on the dais -- asking questions of Castor, who he had testified alongside of just hours earlier. And Republicans went crazy. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert said it was beyond the pale. Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee himself, registered considerable umbrage at a witness turning questioner.Nadler insisted he was within his rights, which I don't question. But there's also little question it was a very weird look that a guy who had testified alongside Castor in the morning was questioning Castor in the afternoon.Republicans turn on Gordon SondlandIf all you knew about the Ukraine controversy was what you learned by watching Monday's hearing, you would think that Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the European Union, was some liberal Democrat. Everyone from Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan to Republican counsel Steve Castor ran down Sondland and the testimony he offered under oath that there had been a quid pro quo between the White House and the Ukrainians. They said that he was unreliable and that Democrats' report out of the House Intelligence Committee relied too heavily on Sondland's testimony.But here's the thing: Sondland is not only a Republican and a major donor to Trump's inaugural committee but also someone who was hand-picked for the job as ambassador by Trump himself! So what changed about Sondland that led Republicans to turn on him? His testimony was not what Republicans wanted. Simple."
"For Iowa Democrats, the caucuses come down to Trump",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/trump-dominates-iowa-caucuses-ip-forecast-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week's ""Inside Politics"" forecast.1. In Iowa, it's all about TrumpPresident Donald Trump isn't running in the Iowa Democratic caucuses. But CNN senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny says that with fewer than 60 days to go, the President is the dominant player in the race.""I was surprised this week talking to some liberal voters who say they're so worried about President Trump, it's driving their decisions,"" Zeleny said. ""One woman said she wanted to support Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but can't do it. Doesn't see her as electable.""Zeleny said that reminds him of a Democratic race more than a decade ago.""This race is like 2004, when George W. Bush was in office, so the sitting president is at the center of so many conversations,"" Zeleny said.2. Supreme Court blocks federal executionsThe Supreme Court is blocking the President from bringing back the death penalty for federal crimes. The federal government hasn't put any prisoner to death in nearly 20 years. Trump ordered an end to that hiatus, with a series of executions that had been scheduled to start this week.""That's now on hold, because the Supreme Court has blocked both the first execution and several others that were planned,"" said AP Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace. ""It's just one of several instances that we've seen of the courts stepping in to block administration priorities. We've seen this numerous times on immigration, for example.""Trump hasn't yet made public comments about last week's decision.""It's going to be interesting to see how aggressively he tries to fight back against the Supreme Court on this,"" Pace said. Unlike immigration, she said, ""restarting federal executions is not something that he had really prioritized, nor is it something that there's much of a national constituency for.""3.  A Space Force trade-offTrump is close to a deal with Democrats that would give each of them one of their key priorities: a new Space Force branch of the military in exchange for paid parental leave for federal workers.Both measures could be included in the annual military authorization bill, Washington Post congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian said.""We knew that if Trump was going to get his Space Force, there had to be a trade-off,"" Demirjian said. ""And this is significant, on the paid family leave. It tends to be that whatever the government does, sets the tone for the nation. There have been discussions about having a national paid family leave policy, and the President's daughter has promoted that sort of thing.""Reaction to the trade-off could determine whether Congress moves to a broader family leave bill.""What people say about this deal, especially on the GOP side, could set a standard for where this goes in the future and if it has a chance of expanding beyond this,"" Demirjian said.  4. The World Trade Organization's demise?The World Trade Organization was created a quarter-century ago to police the global trade system and police major disputes. But the Trump Administration is about to render it toothless.The US has been blocking the appointment of new members to the WTO's appellate panel to replace those whose terms have ended. And as of this week, there will be just one confirmed judge, which means it can't settle disputes between countries.""Starting on December 11, the trade court is not going to have enough judges to issue binding resolutions,"" Wall Street Journal White House reporter Vivian Salama said. ""So what does that mean? Someone raises a claim and it essentially could go unresolved.""How did we get here?""It's part of the Trump Administration's broader war against a lot of multilateral organizations, including the WTO. So in the words of (former US trade ambassador) Carla Hills, 'You'll replace the rule of law with the rule of the jungle.'"""
Christopher Steele said he's not biased against President Trump because he was 'friendly' with Ivanka Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/steele-ivanka-trump-ig-watchdog-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The former British spy who compiled a controversial dossier on President Donald Trump told investigators it was ""ridiculous"" to think he was biased against Trump because he had ""been friendly"" with Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter. Christopher Steele made the comments to investigators as part of the Justice Department inspector general's report on the FBI's Russia probe. While the name Steele refers to in the report is redacted, a source close to Steele's corporate intelligence agency confirmed the family member is Ivanka Trump. According to the report, Steele said ""if anything he was 'favorably disposed' toward the Trump family before he began his research because he had visited a Trump family member at Trump Tower and 'been friendly' with [the family member] for some years.""   He told investigators their relationship was ""personal"" and said he had once given that person a Scottish family tartan.CNN has reached out to representatives for Ivanka Trump for comment.ABC News first reported Steele's connection to Ivanka Trump.Steele spent two days meeting with representatives of the Justice Department in London to voluntarily cooperate with their probe in June this year and followed up with further conversations via Skype. His corporate intelligence company, Orbis, also provided the inspector general with access to its internal documents and memoranda of its meetings with the FBI since the firm's relationship with the bureau began in 2013.Orbis had a chance to review 50 pages of the report pertaining to Steele and his firm last week and highlighted numerous mistakes and inaccuracies, in particular with Steele's characterization in some parts of the report as a ""confidential human source"" rather than as a contractor, according to material prepared by Orbis and seen by CNN.Attorney General William Barr made the unusual decision to declassify additional information on Steele, The New York Times first reported.Monday's report also detailed what the FBI found when it tried to verify information in Steele's dossier on Trump and Russia -- including attempts to verify the existence of video tapes of ""alleged unorthodox sexual activity.""Steele's primary source for information in the dossier, for instance, told the FBI he or she may have talked about Trump's alleged sexual activities in ""jest"" and couldn't confirm whether the tape was real, the report states, quoting the source.Still, many of the claims by Steele have held up over time, or have proven to be at least partially true, including the fact that there was a concerted Russian operation to attack the 2016 US presidential election. The Justice Department has brought criminal charges against dozens of Russian hackers and online trolls for allegedly interfering with the election.CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.

"2 GOP senators say McConnell will move to acquit Trump, not merely dismiss charges",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/politics/mcconnell-impeachment-trial-acquittal/index.html,"Republicans want to have a vote on acquittal -- to clear the President of the charges against him -- not simply rely on a 51-vote threshold procedural motion to dismiss the hotly disputed case.   The Constitution mandates 67 votes are required to convict the President and remove him from office, a barrier widely considered too high to be reached in this case. One vote McConnell can't rely on is that of Vice President Mike Pence, who has ""no role in impeachment,"" according to a GOP leadership aide, despite being president of the Senate with the mandate to break ties.  Pence's power, which applies to legislation and nominations, isn't in effect when the Senate is weighing removing his boss, an obvious conflict of interest since he would replace Trump if he were removed. Instead, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts would preside at the trial and any tie motions would fail. One of the senators, speaking anonymously, said McConnell would not call a vote on a motion to proceed to the impeachment articles unless he knew he had the 51 votes needed to end the trial, which would then set up a final vote on the articles themselves. On that final vote, 67 votes would be needed to convict Trump and remove him from office.The other senator, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said it ""would make more sense"" to move to vote on the articles of impeachment -- with their 67-vote requirement -- than on a motion to dismiss and ""decide this on a 51-vote threshold, with the potential tie and all the recriminations that would flow from that.""McConnell hinted at this strategy when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday and said the Senate would have two choices after hearing opening arguments from the House impeachment managers and the President's defense counsel. ""It could go down the path of calling witnesses and basically having another trial or it could decide -- and again, 51 members could make that decision -- that they've heard enough and believe they know what would happen and could move to vote on the two articles of impeachment,"" he said. ""Those are the options. No decisions have been made yet."""
Senior State Dept. aide once called Obama a Kenyan and Pelosi a Nazi whose Botox wore off,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/frank-wuco-obama-pelosi-kfile/index.html,"Frank Wuco, a former conservative speaker and radio host who is now a senior adviser at the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, also said it would be tough for a ""solid, practicing"" Muslim to be a good American and made unfounded claims that some Muslims in America were practicing Sharia law to create ""Muslim land."" Wuco's comments, which span from 2009 to 2016, were unearthed by CNN's KFile during a review of his media appearances and public writings.Wuco has a history of peddling conspiracy theories, pushing for extreme American action in warfare and spreading anti-Muslim rhetoric. CNN's KFile previously reported that Wuco interviewed authors promoting birtherism and pushed other conspiracy theories on prominent Obama administration officials.Wuco had a career as a radio host and pundit before joining the Trump administration in 2017. During that time, Wuco frequently cited his past experience in the Navy to promote himself as an expert on jihad and military matters, such as when he expressed his personal belief that nuclear weapons should have been used in Afghanistan the day after 9/11.Wuco was previously a White House adviser at the Department of Homeland Security. His new role at the State Department was first reported by the Washington Post last month. The State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance mission statement says it is responsible for ""deterring conflict"" and working to build ""cooperation among allies and partners in order to control the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.""The State Department and Wuco did not respond to requests for comment. Called Obama a Kenyan and Pelosi a NaziDuring Wuco's career as a conservative talk show host from 2011 to 2013, he frequently belittled and mocked Democratic leadership and liberals on his platforms. At a 2013 event with Tea Party supporters, Wuco gave a speech critical of Obama. After a man from the crowd shouted that Obama was ""a plagiarizer,"" Wuco responded: ""I thought he was a Kenyan!""Wuco used his platform as a radio host to promote the debunked conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the US and questioned whether Obama sounded ""super ethnic"" for a man who knew ""nothing about the black American experience.""On an episode of The Frank Wuco Show in 2011, Wuco called Pelosi ""Nancy Nazi Pelosi"" and mocked her appearance, saying that her ""Botox"" had worn off. He likened the moment to a ""Darth Vader"" reveal, alluding to the iconic Star Wars villain removing his helmet.""Seeing her last night, it made me think -- I'll have to ask my brother-in-law who's a plastic surgeon if this is true,"" he said. ""But I'm telling you that Botox has got to have an expiration date on it. No, I'm not talking about Botox in the bottle. I am talking about Botox in your face. And apparently from what I saw last night, it's not a gradual expiration.""Questioned if you could be a good American and a good MuslimWuco has publicly and loudly pushed anti-Muslim views in his radio appearances and writings for well over a decade. Wuco said some Muslim American communities called ""for the application of Sharia law"" so the community would become ""Muslim land."" Wuco called the city of Karachi, Pakistan, one of the largest Muslim cities in the world, a ""pit of filth, poverty, human despair, that is about as good as Pakistani cities get"" in a blog post in 2010. He referred to French Muslim women as ""hijab hysterical.""""Muslims here in the United States and in many European countries create sort of these enclave communities. They move into an area, they sort of concentrate their presence in a certain area -- and a lot of that is good, old fashioned, just people wanting to be near people that they're familiar with culturally and religiously and all that stuff,"" he said on AM Tampa Bay in 2014. ""Another piece of it, if you want to go even deeper, is you've seen a lot of these densely populated Muslim areas where in some cases they actually start calling for the application of Sharia law in these areas,"" he added. ""If you want it to carry it to the furthest extreme where you have an area that has densely populated with Muslims, where they're able to manage to get Sharia law applied in Islamic theology, that then becomes Muslim land.In the same appearance, Wuco was asked if it is possible to be a ""good American and a good Muslim."" He paused before answering, ""That's a tough one."" Wuco said that in the eyes of theological purists like ISIS, ""It's impossible to be a good anything and a good Muslim because in Islamic theology, you're everything Islamic -- people, the land, the property is all in the house of Islam. You don't have a nationality. You're a Muslim.""He added, ""So I would say no. If you're a purist and you're a real, good, solid, practicing Muslim it becomes very, very tough.""Wuco also expressed disbelief of any backlash against Muslim Americans after a terrorist incident or suspected terrorist arrests in America. ""There IS NO BACKLASH. And is that our biggest concern, REALLY??? Backlash??? How about the backlash of fear among YOUR FELLOW AMERICAN CITIZENS, that they are AFRAID TO GO TO THE MALL, the MALL!!! Mall owners are now spending $10,000′s on a public campaign to calm shoppers that they are not going to be the victims of a jihad-inspired mass murder while they do a little early Christmas shopping,"" Wuco wrote in a blog post from October 2009. ""WE are a good society! We don't murder, maim, and harass ethnic groups writ large (a PLEASE, if you hit me with the slavery issue or what befell the American Indians in the 19th Century, I'll delete your ridiculous post),"" he continued.  Wuco said US military actions in war should be censored from the public Wuco frequently spoke and wrote about the military over the years. In an interview with the Dougherty Report radio show in 2016, Wuco contended that war needs to be censored from everyday Americans.""People at home shouldn't be seeing warfare. Warfare is a very ugly thing. It needs to be done in an extremely ugly and violent way,"" he said. ""I believe that war should be censored.""""There are things in war that defy common sense,"" he continued. ""There are things in war that defy common decency. It's war. So, you don't want to direct all of your energy answering questions on why you did something horrific in wartime when war is entirely horrific. Either it is or it isn't. There's no nice way to do warfare."" "
Trump lights National Christmas Tree to mark holiday season,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/national-christmas-tree-lighting-ceremony-2019/index.html," (CNN)For the third time in his presidency, President Donald Trump counted down the crowd on the Ellipse outside the White House to the ceremonial lighting of the National Christmas Tree. ""We'll count from five down to that very special number,"" the President said, before counting down to one, when first lady Melania Trump to hit the button and lit the Christmas tree.  It's a tradition that goes back to 1923, when President Calvin Coolidge lit a 48-foot Balsalm Fir on Christmas Eve. Trump, while not known for sticking to tradition, kept his remarks brief and on message. He walked out on stage to ""Oh Christmas Tree,"" played by the US Marine Corps band and spoke about the meaning of Christmas.""More than 2,000 years ago, a brilliant star shone in the East,"" the President told the crowd in President's Park.""Wise men traveled far, far, afield -- I mean they were a long distance away -- and they came and they stood with us under the star, where they found the holy family in Bethlehem. As the Bible tells us, when the wise men had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshiped him,"" Trump said, reading from prepared remarks.""Christians give thanks that the son of God came into the world to save humanity. Jesus Christ inspires us to love one another with hearts full of generosity and grace,"" he continued.But the shadow of politics, and impeachment, still hung over the event. The only members of Congress that the White House officially said would attend were Republican allies Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, and Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas. The ceremony came on the same day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would be pursuing articles of impeachment against the President. Congress is also two weeks away from the deadline to avoid a government shutdown like the one that crippled Washington last year.The National Christmas tree briefly closed last year, in part because of the partial shutdown. The National Park Foundation said in a statement that the site was closed after a man climbed the tree, and remained closed because of the partial government shutdown. But support from the National Park Service's charitable foundation allowed the site to reopen on Christmas Eve.""The National Park Foundation and hundreds of local philanthropic organizations and other park partners are always working to help ensure all people have access to our treasured national parks,"" said Will Shafroth, president of the National Park Foundation, in a statement.The park itself remained accessible through the shutdown, although Park Service facilities and the White House Visitor Center would stay closed.How to Visit The Pathway of Peace site is free to visit and open to the public December 9, 2019, through January 1, 2020. Hours are 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday, and 10 a.m.-11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, according to the National Park Service.What to ExpectThe walkway surrounding the National Christmas Tree features 56 state and territory trees decorated with handmade ornaments that are unique to each tree.The National Christmas Tree lights turn on at approximately 4:30 pm and turn off promptly at 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday."
Mueller witness Rick Gates seeks to avoid prison after extensive cooperation with prosecutors,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/rick-gates-probation-request/index.html," (CNN)President Donald Trump's former deputy campaign chairman and top witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe Rick Gates has asked for a sentence of just probation after extensive cooperation with prosecutors following a guilty plea to two federal crimes.The court filing highlights just how significant Gates had been in the Mueller investigation and to prosecutors as they went after other targets, including a former White House counsel, Roger Stone and Gates' former boss, Paul Manafort. Some details about what Gates spoke to prosecutors about are still under seal.His attorney notes in a filing Monday night that prosecutors will attest to the court how helpful he's been and will ask for a reduced sentence for his admissions of guilt. He pleaded guilty to two charges -- conspiracy and lying to the FBI -- in February 2018. Since then, he's testified against his former associates at three criminal trials.""We believe that the parties are in agreement that Mr. Gates has fulfilled every obligation he agreed to (and then some) and that he has devoted enormous energy and commitment to this task while telling the truth and maintaining his composure,"" his attorney wrote Monday. ""There is no perfect way to convey to the Court how far Richard Gates has traveled on the proverbial road to redemption,"" the attorney also wrote, before quoting from a letter written by Charlie Black -- a former business partner of Manafort and Stone -- on Gates' behalf that recent ""suffering has restored his character and restored his high ethical standards.""The filing notes Gates sat for more than 500 hours of interviews with state and federal prosecutors, and even spoke with congressional staff.Gates' attorney outlines just how difficult his cooperation with Mueller's team had been. He hasn't been employed since he was charged with dozens of crimes in October 2017 alongside Manafort, and has been seeing a psychologist for more than a year.During Manafort's trial, Gates had admitted on the witness stand to a host of transgressions, from embezzling from his boss' company to having an extra-marital affair.His defense attorney notes he has held his family together and volunteered with the Red Cross and youth soccer teams.He is scheduled for sentencing on December 17."
Schiff says lawmakers investigating if mystery person who spoke with Giuliani is Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/adam-schiff-rudy-giuliani-cnntv/index.html," (CNN)House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said on Tuesday night that his committee is still looking into the identity of the person who Rudy Giuliani was speaking with and had the obscured phone number of ""-1"" -- and whether that person is President Donald Trump.""We can't confirm yet who"" the number belongs to, Schiff said during an interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""We are certainly investigating that,"" Schiff said. ""Rudy Giuliani only had one client -- and that was Donald Trump.""The committee's impeachment inquiry report shows Giuliani speaking a number of times with that individual during several key moments detailed in the document.Schiff noted in the interview that the phone number -1 also came up during the trial of former Trump adviser Roger Stone.According to evidence shown to the jury during the trial, Stone received an incoming call on August 1, 2016, from a phone number listed as -1. That call came roughly six minutes after he had gotten off the phone with then-candidate Trump on a day when he also spoke with Rick Gates, then a campaign adviser to Trump. The evidence at trial did not definitively establish that the -1 calls were coming from any one person, including Trump.The phone number was listed in phone records released by Democrats as a part of the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry report, released Tuesday, but the report does not establish who the number belongs to.The phone records, which are labeled in the report's endnotes as coming from AT&T, show a web of communications between journalist John Solomon, Giuliani, Ukrainian American businessman Lev Parnas, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes of California and the White House's budget office. CNN is owned by AT&T.Many of the calls occurred in April, according to the Democratic report, the same time Solomon pumped out columns in The Hill. The stories were filled with discredited conspiracy theories about then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son was on the board of a prominent Ukrainian energy company."
House Democrat says he plans to vote against all articles of impeachment,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/democrats-against-impeachment-jeff-van-drew/index.html," (CNN)Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, one of two Democrats to vote against formalizing the impeachment inquiry, said he plans to vote against all the articles of impeachment ""unless there's something that I haven't seen, haven't heard before."" He warned Democrats to ""be careful what you wish for"" and he added that impeachment ""is tearing the nation apart. ... And I want to bring people together.""Van Drew, whose district voted for Trump in 2016, said he would have preferred a censure vote on Trump so they could ""move on."" Van Drew was first elected in 2018, winning a seat that was previously GOP controlled. Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the other Democrat who also opposed the inquiry, was also asked if he'd vote to impeach.""I don't have an idea what they're doing,"" Peterson said.Moderate Democrats, particularly those in Trump-leaning districts, resisted moving forward on an impeachment inquiry throughout much of the year, as liberal Democrats pushed for Congress to take up special counsel Robert Mueller's report to launch an impeachment inquiry. That all changed in September when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a narrow impeachment inquiry to investigate the Ukraine allegations, and nearly every House Democrat publicly backed it.Pelosi at a news conference on Thursday morning dismissed the notion she was concerned about her moderates facing blowback for impeachment.""This has absolutely nothing to do with politics,"" she said. A simple majority is needed to impeach in the House where Democrats have a 233-197 advantage. "
Chicago mayor presses Buttigieg: You should break your NDA with elite consulting firm,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-pete-buttigieg/index.html,"Waterloo, Iowa (CNN)Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot pressed presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg to break his non-disclosure agreement with the elite consulting firm that once employed him, as the crowded 2020 Democratic race progresses toward the Iowa caucuses. Lightfoot asked the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, ""Shouldn't you break that NDA (with McKinsey and Company), so that you have the moral authority and the high ground against somebody like (President Donald) Trump, who hides behind the lack of transparency to justify everything he's doing?""Buttigieg, who was being interviewed by Lightfoot on Friday as part of a forum hosted by the US Conference of Mayors and Accelerator for America in Waterloo, Iowa, pointed to a newly released statement from his campaign that detailed the projects, though not the clients, he worked with during his time at McKinsey.The release came after some of Buttigieg's presidential opponents also called on him to be more transparent about his time at the firm as some of McKinsey's work for the federal government, including for Immigration and Customs Enforcement on projects along the US-Mexico border, drew increased scrutiny this month.""I've pushed as much information as I can, without breaking the promise that I made in writing,"" Buttigieg told Lightfoot. ""And I am asking my former employer to do the right thing, to not make me choose between claiming the moral high ground and going back on my word.""Lightfoot, however, seemed skeptical. ""But they're not going to do that, right? And NDAs are, courts across the land have said that they're not enforceable, you should break the NDA.""For his part, Buttigieg, said, ""I'm going to give them a chance to do the right thing, and then we'll take it from there.""Later, Lightfoot told reporters that while ""Pete is, as you saw, a really tough smart, thoughtful guy who's taking the experience that he has as the mayor of South Bend and elevating that to what the solutions can be on a national level,"" she's concerned an NDA could hurt him in a general election fight against Trump.""The fact of the matter is, it's going to be a brutal nasty general election campaign, and anybody who thinks that Donald Trump isn't going to fight hard, and in the mud on every issue is fooling themselves,"" Lightfoot told reporters in Iowa. ""And when you've got an issue that he's going to equate to his issue, you got to figure out how to deal with it.""On the campaign trail, Buttigieg, who is a gay Midwestern mayor, often casts himself as the antithesis of Trump. In a gaggle with reporters, Lightfoot, herself an openly lesbian Midwestern mayor, joked to CNN, ""I know a little bit about that,"" but ""It's not enough, as I think any mayor here would attest, to not be Donald Trump, we've got to speak to a positive message that's going to speak to the core component of the Democratic Party, the Independents, the suburbanites, who are sick and tired of all the vitriol and the divisiveness, that's what we want, we need somebody who's not only going to speak the values, but also have a real plan to deliver, because as mayors, we can't kick the can down the road.""Lightfoot has not yet endorsed a candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary, though she told reporters in Iowa on Friday she'd likely wait until after the Iowa caucuses in February."
Three legal experts make forceful case for impeaching Trump at contentious hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/impeachment-hearing-wednesday-recap/index.html," (CNN)A trio of legal scholars argued at the first House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing Wednesday that President Donald Trump's unprecedented conduct was evidence of impeachable offenses, amid vocal protests and procedural roadblocks thrown up by Republicans to challenge the impeachment proceedings.The opening impeachment hearing held by the panel expected to draft articles of impeachment was contentious from the moment Chairman Jerry Nadler gaveled it into session until he banged the hearing to a close to Republican protests more than eight hours later. Republicans repeatedly forced procedural votes and peppered Nadler with questions about what the committee was doing as they dismissed the entire proceeding as a sham.The hearing marked an important step for Democrats in the impeachment proceedings, which have shifted from the House Intelligence Committee-led investigation to the Judiciary panel. Democrats are on track for an impeachment vote on the House floor by the end of the year, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a closed-door, members-only meeting Wednesday morning where Democrats agreed to continue moving forward with the inquiry, asking her members: ""Are you ready?""The hearing was only the latest sign that all sides of the Capitol are preparing for an impeachment vote -- and a subsequent trial in the Senate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone was huddled with Senate Republicans at their party lunch Wednesday, while Vice President Mike Pence stopped by the House Republican conference meeting before the hearing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, gave a presentation at his party's caucus lunch about the mechanics of a potential Senate trial.And the Senate released its 2020 calendar on Wednesday -- leaving off the month of January, in anticipation of a trial.The Judiciary Committee hearing provided new clues to the scope of the Democrats' expected articles of impeachment against Trump, with questions over obstruction of justice from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation suggesting there could be a Mueller element to the articles, in addition to charges related to Ukraine and obstruction of Congress.Inside the hearing room, Democrats pushed past the Republican objections to elicit testimony from three of the four legal experts to explain why Trump's actions constituted impeachment offenses.Those three professors, Harvard University's Noah Feldman, Stanford University's Pamela Karlan and the University of North Carolina's Michael Gerhardt, were all asked, based on the House Intelligence Committee evidence, ""Did President Trump commit the impeachable high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power?"" All said that he did.""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" Gerhardt said. ""This is precisely the misconduct that the framers created a Constitution, including impeachment, to protect against.""While the three Democratic-invited law professors backed impeachment, the law professor called by Republicans to testify, George Washington University's Jonathan Turley, argued that Democrats were making a mistake by pursuing a ""slipshod"" impeachment that would have long-lasting consequences.""I am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. I believe this impeachment not only fails to satisfy the standard of past impeachments but would create a dangerous precedent for future impeachments,"" Turley said.Nadler vowed to move swiftly to impeach Trump if his committee concludes that Trump committed impeachable offenses. ""Never before, in the history of the republic, have we been forced to consider the conduct of a president who appears to have solicited personal, political favors from a foreign government,"" said Nadler, a New York Democrat. ""When we apply the Constitution to those facts, if it is true that President Trump has committed an impeachable offense — or impeachable offenses — then we must move swiftly to do our duty and charge him accordingly.""Republicans slammed the Democratic impeachment inquiry, which Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee, dismissed as a ""railroad job.""""This is not an impeachment. This is simply a railroad job,"" Collins said. ""And today is a waste of time.""In addition to the Ukraine allegations, Democrats have focused a portion of their questioning on the obstruction of justice allegations against Trump outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Democrats haven't yet said whether the Mueller allegations will be included in potential articles of impeachment, as some congressional Democrats have pushed for.As they questioned the academics, Democrats displayed a slide on a hearing room screen titled, ""Impeachable offenses,"" which listed three items: ""Abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress, and obstruction of justice"" — a possible hint about Democrats' intentions for articles of impeachment. ""How serious is that evidence of obstruction of justice?"" Democratic counsel Norm Eisen asked Gerhardt.""Obstruction of justice has been recognized as an impeachable offense both against President Clinton and President Nixon. This evidence that's been put forward by Mr. Mueller that's in the public record is very strong evidence of obstruction of justice,"" Gerhardt said.Republicans force procedural votesRepublicans launched their protests of the hearing seconds after it began, which included forcing procedural votes on motions for House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff to testify, to have the whistleblower testify and to postpone Wednesday's hearing. The effort continued until the very end of the hearing, with Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas asking to be recognized to submit another item for the congressional record.""Too late,"" Nadler said, banging the gavel down.""Just typical,"" Gohmert responded as the witnesses began to exit.The move from the Intelligence panel to the Judiciary Committee has ratcheted up the partisan temperature in the committee room, as the committee has some of the most vocal partisans in Congress on both sides of the aisle. But the law professors made clear they weren't going to just be props for a partisan fistfight.Karlan pushed back against Collins, who said in his opening statement the professors ""couldn't have possibly actually digested the Adam Schiff report from yesterday or the Republican response in any real way.""""Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts, so I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts,"" she said.Later, Karlan and GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida got into a heated exchange, after Gaetz raised the political contributions and past writings of the law professors. He took aim at Karlan's joke earlier in the hearing that the President could name his son Barron but he could not ""make him a baron.""""When you invoke the President's son's name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument,"" Gaetz said. ""It makes you look mean. It makes you look like you're attacking someone's family, the minor child of the President of the United States.""Karlan apologized for making the quip about Trump's son later in the hearing.""I wish the President would apologize, obviously, for the things that he's done that's wrong, but I do regret having said that,"" Karlan said.Republicans focused their questioning on Turley, giving him the opportunity to detail his problems with the Democratic impeachment inquiry. Turley argued that the Democrats have failed to provide evidence that meets ""any reasonable interpretations"" of the crimes they allege Trump has committed.""If you are going to accuse a president of bribery, you need to make it stick, because you are trying to remove a duly elected president of the United States,"" Turley said. ""The statement has been made not just by these witnesses but Chairman Schiff and others, that this is a clear case of bribery. It's not.""Turley also criticized the Democrats' accusation of obstruction of justice, saying that they have failed to let the courts rule on their subpoenas, unlike in the impeachment proceedings of Richard Nixon, by rushing the process.""If you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power — it's your abuse of power,"" Turley said of Congress. ""Fast and narrow is not a good recipe for impeachment.""Three 'impeachable offenses'Democrats walked the law professors through the allegations that were detailed in the investigation led by the Intelligence Committee, which released its report on Ukraine and obstruction of Congress on Tuesday. Several clips of past witness testimony were played during the hearing to show how the President pushed Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and withheld a White House meeting and US security aid from Kiev.""It wasn't just an abuse of power because the President was serving his own personal interests, but also an abuse of power insofar as the President was putting American national security interests behind his own personal interests,"" Harvard's Feldman said. ""So it brought together two important aspects of the abuse of power: self-gain and undercutting our national security interests.""In addition to the Ukraine allegations, Democrats focused a portion of their questioning on the obstruction of justice accusations against Trump from the Mueller report -- which the Judiciary Committee was investigating in its own impeachment inquiry before the Ukraine scandal broke into the open in September and shifted the investigative focus to the Intelligence Committee.Democrats haven't yet said whether the Mueller allegations will be included in potential articles of impeachment, as some congressional Democrats have pushed for. But the committee gave a possible hint about Democrats' intentions at the hearing, displaying a slide on a hearing room screen titled, ""Impeachable offenses,"" which listed three items: ""Abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress, and obstruction of justice.""""How serious is that evidence of obstruction of justice?"" Democratic committee counsel Norm Eisen asked Gerhardt.""Obstruction of justice has been recognized as an impeachable offense both against President Clinton and President Nixon,"" Gerhardt said. ""This evidence that's been put forward by Mr. Mueller that's in the public record is very strong evidence of obstruction of justice.""Judiciary Committee Democrats have yet to say what the next steps are in the inquiry, but Schiff said Tuesday that his staff would be presenting the Intelligence Committee report, which could be the next hearing the Judiciary panel holds.Another question still unanswered is whether the President's attorneys will participate in the Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings. Trump's attorneys declined to participate in Wednesday's hearing, arguing that the process was unfair and they were given no details about the hearing itself.Nadler has given the President's lawyers until Friday to say whether they will participate in future impeachment proceedings in the committee.This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.CNN's Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox, Ellie Kaufman, Haley Byrd, David Wright, Nicky Robertson, Alison Main, Giulia McDonnell, Alex Rogers and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report."
Senators grill State Department official on GOP's promotion of debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/senators-us-russia-ukraine-theory/index.html," (CNN)A Senate hearing on Russia policy became a platform for Democrats to hammer home the point that President Donald Trump, some of his senior officials and Republican lawmakers have been spreading a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election.That theory has been at the heart of Trump's justification for withholding aid to Ukraine in return for an investigation into Joe Biden, his chief Democratic rival in 2020 -- a move to leverage US government resources for personal political benefit that has triggered a House impeachment inquiry. Asked if he was aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election, Under Secretary of State David Hale said, ""I'm not."" Sen. Robert Menendez, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then asked Hale whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump. ""Yes,"" Hale said, ""the intelligence community assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at our presidential election.""And when asked whether US national security is stronger when senior officials repeat debunked conspiracy theories. Hale told the committee that ""it does not serve our interests.""The exchange, one of several, came as Trump and his supporters continue to insist Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the fact that US intelligence agencies have concluded that the theory has been spread by Russian intelligence in an attempt to deflect blame from Moscow. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- a former CIA director -- refused to counter the discredited Ukraine conspiracy theory on November 26, saying it was the government's ""right"" and ""duty"" to investigate all instances of election interference.Republicans keeping debunked theory aliveThe intelligence community has briefed Congress that Russia is behind the theory, yet some Republican lawmakers, most notably Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, also insist on keeping the debunked theory alive. ""There's no question in my mind Ukraine did try to influence the election,"" Kennedy told CNN on Tuesday morning. ""I know that I've read that the Intelligence Committee made some kind of finding, I don't know what it was,"" said Kennedy, a member of the Judiciary committee. Referring to Fiona Hill, the former senior Russia official on the National Security Council who testified before the House and emphasized that the Ukraine theory is the work of Russian intelligence, Kennedy said, ""I'm aware of Dr. Hill's testimony and she's entitled to her opinion."" As justification, Kennedy pointed to media reports. That seemed to prompt a mild rebuke from Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, when he left the committee hearing on a break. ""Our intelligence community and the representatives today from the Department of State indicate that there was not meddling by Ukraine in our election,"" Romney said. When pressed on whether it was dangerous for some of his Republican colleagues to continue to peddle this theory, Romney demurred. ""I'm not going to comment on other Senators views,"" he said.But he added: ""I do think that we have to adhere to the facts presented to us by our intelligence community and I know some people will look at newspaper accounts and say, gee, this is what I read in the newspaper, but you know not every article is exactly accurate and sometimes articles are being promoted by an intelligence source that is trying to push a narrative that that is not in our interest.""The political manipulations surrounding Ukraine came up between questions US policy on Russia with regard to arms control, terrorism, Syria, Moscow's increasing assertiveness toward Baltic States and its posture toward Europe. Senators also repeatedly raised questions about why the administration has failed to enforce legally required sanctions against Russia and Turkey. But the political cloud surrounding Ukraine came up repeatedly, with lawmakers raising other aspects of Trump's actions on Ukraine. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, explored whether administration efforts that came to light during the House intelligence committee's probe are continuing.He asked whether Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is still involved in diplomatic conversations with Ukraine. Hale, who was the highest ranking State Department official to testify before the House impeachment probe, told the committee, ""No, not that I'm aware of.""New detailsHale's testimony before the House had revealed new details, including confirmation that Pompeo spoke to both Giuliani and Fox News' Sean Hannity about the attacks on former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was dismissed by Trump after a smear campaign by Giuliani.Murphy also asked the administration was still pushing Ukraine to investigate a debunked theory about Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity company that investigated Russia's hack of a Democratic National Committee server. ""No,"" said Hale.And Murphy asked whether it is it currently US policy toward Ukraine to request investigations into the connection between former Vice President Joe Biden's family and a company called Burisma. ""No,"" Hale said. Hale spoke at length about Russian misinformation and Moscow's efforts to influence the 2020 elections. ""Moscow uses digital technologies to target us and our democratic allies from within,"" Hale said. ""These actions include election meddling, and complex, well-resourced influence operations directed by the highest levels of the Russian government, in the very heart of the Western world."" Hale said the US had provided significant foreign assistance in Europe and Eurasia, almost all of which supports ""building resilience to, and increasing pressure on, Russian malign influence, in accordance with the countering Russia's influence fund."" And Hale added that, ""of course, Russian behavior's not just about influencing elections. They also use social media and other cyber tools to try to sow division in our country on a whole host of issues.... We have to have continual focus on this problem.""CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report "
Inspector general: Start of FBI Russia probe was justified and unbiased but investigation had significant errors,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/ig-horowitz-report-russia-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department's inspector general found that the FBI properly opened its investigation into Russian election interference but said there were major errors in how the agency conducted the probe.The report released Monday by inspector general Michael Horowitz did not find ""documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions"" to open investigations that initially focused on campaign advisers Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.While rebutting President Donald Trump's claims that the FBI illegally spied on his campaign, Horowitz's 435-page report criticized the FBI leaders and employees for how they handled four applications for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act targeting Page. Horowitz opened the probe early last year, and his office has reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews as part of its review, including a number of current and former law enforcement officials at the center of ""deep state"" conspiracies.But Attorney General William Barr disputed Horowitz's finding that the FBI properly opened a full investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, based on the evidence it had in July 2016.""The inspector general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a US presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions, that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,"" Barr said in a statement Monday. ""It is also clear that, from its inception the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.""Veteran prosecutor John Durham, who is conducting a larger investigation of the Russia probe, also disputed the IG's findings.The inspector general's report details 17 ""significant inaccuracies and omissions"" in the four Page FISA applications, but the inspector general's report doesn't support Barr's suggestion that the entire investigation lacked merit.  Horowitz said his report only examined the opening of the investigation and the Page surveillance along with the use of confidential human sources.Horowitz found that the FBI followed existing rules, but Horowitz recommended that changes be made, including that the FBI consult top Justice officials before more intrusive investigative steps are taken in investigations dealing with major political campaigns.The report is certain to be weaponized by Republicans who have been battling back weeks of bad headlines about the President's pressure campaign against the Ukrainians and an ongoing impeachment inquiry.Trump claimed victory Monday, calling the FBI investigation an ""attempted overthrow"" and an ""embarrassment.""""The IG report just came out and I was just briefed on it and it's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Trump said during a roundtable on school choice at the White House. ""It is incredible, far worse than I would've ever thought possible.""FISA surveillanceHorowitz's investigation centered on a series of warrants that the FBI filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as they sought to investigate Page, a one-time foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.The warrants were signed by top Justice Department officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, and stated that the FBI believed that Page ""has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" according to redacted copies released last year.To bolster their request to the surveillance court, the FBI relied at times on claims about the Trump campaign collected in a dossier of unverified intelligence reports by former British spy Christopher Steele. The FBI wrote in the applications that Steele had a history of providing reliable information to the FBI and that they believed that the reporting of his that they cited was ""credible."" But FBI investigators noted in later iterations of the warrant that they had severed their relationship with Steele because he shared some of his findings with news organizations. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee who released findings on a study of the FISA warrants have accused the FBI of improperly withholding information from the surveillance court about Steele's political beliefs, as well as the fact that his work was backed financially at one point by the Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Horowitz's office interviewed Steele as part of its investigation.Horowitz, who took office in 2012 after an appointment from President Barack Obama, has built a reputation as a thorough investigator who has the ability to rankle Democrats and Republicans alike.His office's blockbuster report into the FBI's handling of the investigations of Hillary Clinton, released in 2018, excoriated Comey for ""extraordinary and insubordinate"" moves that, along with the revelation of Strzok and Pages text messages, did lasting damage to the FBI's reputation, although ultimately concluded that their actions were not motivated by political bias.Horowitz also released a report in August finding that Comey violated FBI policies when he retained and leaked a set of memos he took documenting meetings with Trump in 2017.The inspector general is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.ConclusionsThe report accused a former FBI lawyer of altering a document related to the Page surveillance That lawyer is under criminal investigation.While it's unclear how significant a role the altered document played in the FBI's investigation of Page, Horowitz did not determine that it undermined the overall validity of the surveillance, sources said.The report concluded that officials at the FBI had enough information to properly launch the investigation in 2016, and dispel the claim that US intelligence agencies tried to plant spies in the Trump campaign.Trump has boosted that narrative without evidence for months and popularized the term ""Spy-gate."" The conspiracy is a frequent topic in the conservative media and often revolves around Joseph Mifsud, a secretive Maltese professor who played a role in the origins of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation.Mifsud had interactions with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI.US intelligence agencies were said to have told Horowitz that Misfud was not an asset for Western intelligence agencies, which is a claim spread by Papadopoulos and other conservative figures. FBI Director Christopher Wray touted the inspector general's claim that the Russia investigation was opened properly in an interview with ABC News on Monday.""I think it's important that the Inspector General found that in this particular instance the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization,"" Wray said, a reaction that puts him at odds with Barr, his boss.Lisa Page and Peter StrzokHorowitz's report also explores the specific roles of a number of controversial FBI officials involved in the early days of the Russia probe, including Peter Strzok, a former senior counterintelligence officer, Lisa Page, an attorney, Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director, and Comey, the former director, who have since left the law enforcement agency under a pall.  Strzok, who had an extramarital affair with Page and exchanged anti-Trump messages with her on an FBI phone, was fired, as was McCabe, who had been accused of lying about contacts with a reporter in a separate investigation by Horowitz's office. Both men have sued the agency in relation to their departures.Horowitz specifically said Strzok and Page did not affect the start of the investigation or didn't act out of political bias.""While Lisa Page attended some of the discussions regarding the opening of the investigations, she did not play a role in the decision to open Crossfire Hurricane or the four individual cases,"" Horowitz wrote.""We further found that while Strzok was directly involved in the decisions to open Crossfire Hurricane and the four individual cases, he was not the sole, or even the highest-level, decision maker as to any of those matters,"" the IG added.The decision to open the investigation was made by Bill Priestap, who was Strzok's supervisor, after he spoke with the FBI director, general counsel and other top agency leaders.""We concluded that Priestap's exercise of discretion in opening the investigation was in compliance with Department and FBI policies, and we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced his decision,"" the report states.Lisa Page tweeted in response: ""The sum total of findings by IG Horowitz that my personal opinions had any bearing on the course of either the Clinton or Russia investigations? Zero and Zero. Cool, cool.""FBI interactions with Trump campaignHorowitz also revealed new interactions between FBI investigators and the Trump campaign that are certain to inflame Republicans who have claimed Trump's team was spied on.In August 2016, just months before the presidential election, an FBI supervisor who oversaw the burgeoning counterintelligence investigation attended a briefing that intelligence officials were giving to the Trump campaign, in part so that the FBI supervisor could observe Michael Flynn, a former general who had taken on a leading national security role in the campaign.The agent later wrote a memo recording his observations at the meeting of Flynn, who at the time had fallen under scrutiny of FBI investigators.Horowitz found that the interaction didn't violate Justice Department regulations, but said that it had the potential to undermine the trust in future such campaign briefings. Overall, Horowitz determined that the President's campaign was not improperly ""spied"" on, but the report does document multiple interactions between members of the Trump campaign and FBI sources.One of the FBI covert interactions involved a high-ranking Trump campaign official who was not under investigation at the time, Horowitz wrote. The campaign official is not named in the report.More to comeThe report will not be the final word on the Russia investigation's legitimacy, and Trump has already foreshadowed a separate investigation being conducted out of the Justice Department by Durham.That probe was launched earlier this year by Attorney General William Barr, a longtime skeptic of the Russia probe. People familiar with Barr's thinking have told CNN that despite the conclusions in the Horowitz report, Barr still has questions about some of the intelligence and other information the FBI used to pursue the Russia investigation, and he has been telling allies to wait for Durham, who he thinks will provide a more complete accounting. In a statement, Durham said he has the ""utmost respect"" for the inspector general, but noted his investigation will be more comprehensive.""Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the US and outside of the US,"" Durham said. This story is breaking and will be updated.CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report."
Betsy DeVos defends plan for offering only some debt relief to defrauded students,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/betsy-devos-student-debt-loan-forgiveness/index.html,"The Department of Education this week restarted processing the more than 200,000 claims for debt cancellation that have built up under DeVos' tenure -- but the amount of relief will be based on borrowers' current incomes, rather than the total amount of debt.""If students have been deceived by institutions and suffered financial harm as a result, they should be made whole,"" DeVos said at a House Education and Labor Committee hearing.""But if claims are false, or students did not suffer financial harm, then hardworking taxpayers -- including those that scraped and saved to pay their own student loans -- should not have to pay somebody else's student loans, too,"" she added. Under new methodology, the government will offer partial relief, instead of canceling the full amount of debt for eligible borrowers. The calculation is based on how much those former students are earning compared with those who attended similar programs at different schools.'I know fraud when I see it'Democrats slammed the partial relief calculation, arguing that students who were misled by their colleges should not have to pay back their loans regardless of their current salaries. The calculation is based on the median earnings of those filing claims and compares them with the median earnings of those who attended similar programs at other schools. ""I know fraud when I see it, and these students were misled and cheated -- and the fact that some of them may be making money doesn't mean that they weren't defrauded,"" said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, a former consumer protection lawyer. Bonamici asked DeVos how she can reassure borrowers who filed claims that she's doing everything in her power to get relief.""I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to continue to move ahead with our new methodology, and assuming no challenge through the courts of that methodology, we'll be able to process these claims that have been pending for many years,"" DeVos said. ""And that's the methodology that if someone's making money, they weren't defrauded. That is not justice,"" Bonamici fired back. DeVos has fought the implementation of the Obama-era debt forgiveness rule, which was a key part of the previous administration's efforts to regulate for-profit colleges. She first froze the rule and then attempted to rewrite it.Efforts to crack down on fraudulent debt-relief claimsIn her testimony, DeVos said again that she blamed the Obama administration for failing to put a process in place for reviewing the claims. A court blocked the department for using the first calculation it had drawn up under DeVos for granting relief last year, and it has not processed any claims since then. Anyone who filed a claim under the previous system, the secretary said, could receive full debt relief -- without proper accountability for how taxpayer dollars were being used. ""There have been a number of quite unbelievable claims made,"" said DeVos, citing borrowers she said had asked for loan forgiveness because they didn't like their professors. When asked by Democratic Rep. Joseph Morelle of New York how many false claims had been submitted, DeVos said she didn't have a number. She appeared before the committee Thursday at the request of Chairman Bobby Scott, who asked why the department has let a backlog of more than 200,000 applications for student loan forgiveness build up.In October, DeVos was found in contempt of court and the department fined $100,000 for mistakenly trying to collect on about 45,000 loans to people who were waiting to hear about the status of their claims.Inflated job-placement numbersThe claims were mostly filed by borrowers who took out loans to attend for-profit colleges, like the now-defunct Corinthian and ITT Tech. Many claim that the schools misled them with inflated job-placement numbers, and some of the former students have been waiting for years to hear if they will be granted debt relief. ""Madame Secretary, your refusal to process claims is inflicting serious harm on the students you have the duty to serve,"" said Scott, a Democrat from Virginia.""While the department has been searching for a legal method of shortchanging defrauded borrowers, those defrauded borrowers have been left with mountains of debt, worthless degrees and none of the job opportunities they were promised,"" he added. Republican ranking member Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina defended the secretary, arguing that any suggestions from across the aisle that DeVos is purposely delaying debt relief are false. Republicans, she said, support DeVos' new methodology. She likened the process to receiving an insurance claim after a car accident. ""I guarantee you that the insurance companies don't write you a check for what you think is your damage. They assess that damage,"" Foxx said."
Virginia Democratic rep in swing district faces heat at town hall over impeachment,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/abigail-spanberger-town-hall-constituent-confrontation/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)A Virginia Democratic congresswoman who was a reluctant supporter of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump found herself in the middle of a tense town hall on Sunday when she explained her position on the matter.Constituents in Rep. Abigail Spanberger's moderate district -- she unseated Republican Rep. Dave Brat last year -- who both supported and opposed the impeachment effort shouted at times during the event in Spotsylvania, Virginia. She was discussing her record and instances when she voted against House Democratic leadership when a few audience members interrupted and told her to move on to impeachment.""My opinion of our inquiry is mine and mine alone. No one has pressured me to vote in any particular way from within the party. And I will not be pressured to vote in any particular way,"" she said. ""The allegations against the President are incredibly, incredibly serious."" ""They're bulls***,"" one attendee said as another shouted that ""it's crap."" ""It's a lie, it's all a lie,"" an attendee said, a remark Spanberger responded to by highlighting the various House hearings held as part of the inquiry. ""Those witnesses have all affirmed and all agreed on what happened,"" she said. ""That the President sought to use military assistance ... as leverage to get a foreign government to do what he wanted."" ""It's all lies, it's all lies,"" an attendee yelled, cutting off the congresswoman, who is visibly frustrated with the crosstalk. As House Democrats push ahead with their case against Trump, moderate Democrats in swing districts such as Spanberger will be especially vulnerable in next year's election. Spanberger, the first Democrat to represent her district in almost 50 years, was among the five moderate House freshman Democrats who switched their position on an impeachment inquiry earlier this year from ""no"" to ""yes,"" ultimately helping to move their party closer to launching the probe in September. She co-authored an op-ed in The Washington Post that said Trump's dealings with Ukraine posed a national security threat.Later during Sunday's event, Spanberger said ""no one has dispelled or attempted to dispel or provide evidence that would exonerate the President,"" prompting a number of audience members to harshly criticize her comments.""Did you really say that? You have to prove you're innocent?"" one person sarcastically asked. ""He's been proven guilty,"" another shot back, referring to Trump. Following more back and forth between audience members and Spanberger, the congresswoman noted that impeachment is ""a constitutional remedy that is outlined in the Constitution.""""But if it's such a polarizing issue, let's put it to the voters next fall,"" another said, cutting off Spanberger. A loud exchange then occurs between attendees, with people on both sides of the issue talking back and forth as the congresswoman attempts to retake control of the floor. ""This isn't about this election. This isn't about this President. It is about the presidency,"" she said. ""It is about what behavior is deemed to be appropriate. It is about the security of our 2020 election."" But at least one attendee didn't buy her take, calling the impeachment proceedings ""silly,"" a remark that gained a few ""thank yous"" and an ""amen"" from attendees. Connor Joseph, a spokesman for Spanberger, told CNN on Monday that the town hall was ""another example of Rep. Spanberger engaging in important conversations, updating her neighbors about her work in the House, and listening to the concerns of those she represents. ""Rep. Spanberger appreciates her constituents' continued engagement at her town halls and looks forward to future dialogues about the issues that are important to Central Virginians,"" he added.CNN's Lauren Fox contributed to this report.

GOP yanks support for congressional candidate after death threat against Ilhan Omar,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/george-buck-ilhan-omar-threat/index.html,"Washington (CNN)A Florida Republican congressional hopeful who apparently called for Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats to be hanged in a fundraising email has been removed from a GOP initiative that supports candidates.George Buck Jr., who is challenging Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist in Florida's 13th Congressional District, threatens Omar and Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in an email obtained by CNN that was dated November 26 and includes his signature, though he has denied writing it. The email labels the four minority progressive lawmakers, who call themselves ""The Squad,"" as ""anti-American"" and associates them with Crist.""We should hang these traitors where they stand. I have no tolerance for those who are abusing our system to destroy our country,"" says the email, which also includes unsubstantiated allegations that Omar was a foreign agent. Buck has denied he wrote the email, saying, ""I would never talk like that,"" the Tampa Bay Times reported. CNN has asked Buck to clarify his comment to the Tampa Bay Times.Buck's campaign Facebook page on Wednesday posted three links to news stories about Omar, saying in one post, ""How come no one is calling out Omar for her rhetoric?"" Omar has drawn sharp criticism, including from some in her own party, for comments she's made about political support for Israel.Asked for comment Wednesday, Buck said in an email to CNN: ""I am a decorated veteran of the 101st Airborne Division. As someone who has taken the oath to defend the Constitution, I take that oath very seriously."" He went on in the email to outline the Constitution's reference to treason and Congress' power to enforce punishment, finally stating: ""Anyone who commits treason against the United States should be tried to the full extent of the law.""CNN reached out to Omar's office for a response to the fundraising email and was directed to her Twitter page, where she retweeted comments from others, including Tlaib, condemning the message.""The fact that those who make these violent threats very publicly without hesitation reaffirms just how much white supremacy has spread within the @NRCC,"" Tlaib said in a tweet on Wednesday. ""They are raising money on a call to hang a Black Muslim member of Congress and too many are silent.""National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Michael McAdams told CNN on Wednesday the committee removed Buck from Young Guns, a recruiting initiative that recognizes candidates who show promise of running a successful campaign.

It's yet another reminder how important it is to restore civility to our politics,"" he said in the emailed statement, calling on lawmakers to adhere to a ""Commitment to Civility.""Omar, one of the few Muslim members of Congress, has been repeatedly attacked by President Donald Trump and his supporters. Earlier this year, she said she experienced an increase in death threats after Trump tweeted about a speech in which she said Muslims were faced with greater risk in the United States after the September 11 attacks because ""some people did something.""This is the second threat in a week from a Republican candidate to the Minnesota congresswoman. Twitter permanently suspended the social media account of Danielle Stella, a Republican challenging Omar, for a tweet in which she said the Democrat should be tried for treason and hanged.CNN's Kate Sullivan contributed to this report."
Appeals court divided on future of lawsuit over Trump hotel,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/appeals-court-emoluments-4th-circuit/index.html,"In some of the bluntest public arguments yet in court about President Donald Trump's hotel empire, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals debated a major case challenging whether Trump can continue to accept emoluments, or profits, from his hotel in Washington while in office.At times, judges took over from the arguing attorneys, the Justice Department, Trump's personal legal team and the DC and Maryland state attorneys general offices to argue for or against the President themselves.""We are winging it. If this isn't off the rails, then I don't know what is,"" said Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who's been on the federal appellate bench at least a half decade longer than any other judge in the wood-paneled room Thursday. ""There are, there are other suits involving congressional subpoenas and everything that presents closer questions, but this one's a lemon,"" he added. ""It's the weakest of the cases that are springing up like jimsonweed against the presidency in this environment.""At this stage, a decision could control whether the case has months ahead of it still in court -- keeping the President's companies at risk as his opponents seek financial documents -- or whether it will be dismissed, a win for Trump. Either way, the issue is likely to eventually reach the Supreme Court.""We're treating this as if it's some ordinary run-of-the-mill case. It is not,"" Wilkinson said. He quickly became one of the President's staunchest defenders in court Thursday outside of Trump's own attorney and the Justice Department. Several other judges, appointed by Democrats, expressed their doubt nearly as sharply with the Justice Department's arguments and Trump himself.""Nothing can be done?"" Judge James Wynn Jr. asked, citing rooms being sold at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to foreign governments and the larger question of whether the President is above the rule of law. What can the judiciary do when the President ""openly and without any reservation violates the law?"" Wynn pressed a Justice Department attorney in court. ""No president has done this.""Wilkinson countered him, pointing out that Congress and politics generally can curtail the president's behavior. The judge mentioned the recent announcement and withdrawal of a plan to hold the G7 convention at Trump's Doral resort in Florida following ""immense pressure."" The case is one of three currently before federal appeals courts testing Trump's business interests and the emoluments clause. In this case, Maryland and DC governments say they have been harmed because foreign governments and officials from US states choose to stay or hold events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington to ingratiate themselves with the President. This is unfair to businesses owned by DC and Maryland and to their residents, according to the lawsuit. The two governments had subpoenaed the Trump Organization and federal agencies before that evidence collection was put on hold by the appellate court. If Trump were to sell the Trump International Hotel in Washington -- or even transfer its ownership to his children -- the lawsuit likely would go away. Trump has kept his properties in a trust while he is in office.The Justice Department has argued that Maryland and DC have no ability to sue and the case should be dismissed, and Trump's personal attorneys also say he can't be sued for this personally while he's President.The two other cases include one in New York claiming Trump has an unfair business advantage, and one in DC federal court claiming Democrats in Congress should be able to review the President's business interests. Those have yet to reach a second round of arguments in front of a full appellate court, as this one has, making Thursday's arguments historic.""He can be removed from office ... or he can be voted out of office. But to sue the president is a matter that is unplowed ground, and under the structure of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has not been very kindly to that. Now we have this district court that says we can sue the president,"" said Judge Paul Niemeyer. He had written an opinion dismissing the case previously.""What's being asked here is wholly unprecedented. We have no history to guide us,"" Wilkinson said. ""Congress has just been left on a back doorstep to freeze in the cold.""But another judge on the bench Thursday, Robert King, used the history of the Constitution to slam Trump. ""He said they were 'phony,' "" King said repeatedly, raising his voice as he cited Trump's tweets about the Emoluments Clause. ""They were written in Philadelphia"" at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he added.The Justice Department lawyer, Hashim Mooppan, responded, ""He's calling the claims here phony. It's either a tweet or an off-the-cuff statement.""The early stage of the case didn't stop many of the judges from pushing for answers about what ultimately they could do about Trump's business interests.Wilkinson asked the attorneys challenging Trump to tell him the goal of the case, describing how when you buy a ticket for a flight, you know where the plane will land.""We've gotten through TSA,"" said Loren AliKhan, representing DC and Maryland.The purpose of litigation is that you don't know where a plane will land, and courts must help decide, another judge, Albert Diaz, chimed in.Nearly all of the judges asked questions, with all but one or two appearing to reveal their thoughts on the case. Eight of the judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents and seven by Republicans. Three judges appointed by Trump sat on the panel Thursday.Early in the arguments, a quartet of female judges -- Diana Gribbon Motz, Barbara Milano Keenan, Pamela Harris and Stephanie Thacker -- harshly questioned Mooppan about legal technicalities he used to defend the President.Motz, especially, voiced her agreement with the trial-level judge, Peter Messitte of Maryland, on the case.""It's no slap-dash opinion,"" she said Thursday.Almost two hours later, as Mooppan grew more passionate and repeatedly described his opponent, AliKhan, of the DC attorney general's office, simply as ""she,"" Motz cut in to ask him to call her ""colleague"" or ""counsel.""Previously, a smaller group of three judges, including a senior judge who did not sit on the panel Thursday, chose to dismiss the case, to Trump's delight. But the full appeals court then revived it.This story has been updated with additional details from the hearing."
Democrats debate whether to include Mueller report in impeachment articles,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/mueller-charges-impeachment-investigation/index.html," (CNN)Former special counsel Robert Mueller's report may play a role in the impeachment of President Trump after all.In the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing, Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, said Trump had obstructed justice during both Mueller's two-year investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 US election and the House's impeachment inquiry, which is focused on Trump's alleged abuse of power in pressuring Ukraine to politically damage Democrats.In his opening statement Wednesday, Nadler said Trump's latest actions showed a ""pattern of conduct"" seen since his first year in office. ""When his own Department of Justice tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records, and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses,"" said Nadler. ""Then, as now, this administration's level of obstruction is without precedent.""The remarks appeared to reopen a debate simmering within the Democratic Party since the release of Mueller's 448-page report in April: Were the President's actions impeachable?Mueller found that Trump did not illegally conspire with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, even as Trump and members of his campaign appeared to have sought its interference. Mueller also declined to say whether Trump had illegally obstructed justice, citing the Justice Department's position that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But Mueller did lay out several examples of potential obstruction, including Trump ordering then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller and pushing then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his decision recusing himself from overseeing the inquiry in order to curtail it (both officials refused). While many liberal Democrats in the House had pushed then for impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sided with her members in tough races, who were wary of charging the President with obstructing an investigation that did not find an underlying crime. Polls showed that support for starting impeachment proceedings was well under 50%.But on July 25, a day after Mueller testified before Congress, Trump appears to have pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a phone call to announce an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, whose son Hunter had worked for a Ukrainian energy company. (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.) The impeachment inquiry began with Pelosi's support in September, once the House had received a complaint from a whistleblower who learned of the call and charged that Trump had used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election."" Polls show that a majority of the country supports the impeachment proceedings.As Democrats swiftly pursued the investigation into allegations surrounding Trump and Ukraine, they've privately debated whether the obstruction of justice documented by Mueller should be included in articles of impeachment, as some Democrats have pushed for broadening them beyond Ukraine. Democrats listed three ""impeachable offenses"" at Wednesday's hearing: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. But how they will write the articles still remains to be seen. If Democrats extend the obstruction article to include actions described in the Mueller report, some members could be tempted to vote against it.Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York told CNN that ""no decisions have been made one way or the other"" regarding whether the Mueller report will be included in the articles.Some Democrats still hope that it will be. ""We did a lot of work in the House Judiciary Committee,"" Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told CNN. ""Mueller's report, I think, was pretty clear and damning on that front."" Reps. Ted Deutch of Florida and Pramila Jayapal of Washington -- two other members of the Judiciary Committee -- said the ""pattern"" of obstruction could make it more compelling.Jayapal told CNN, ""To me, you could make a case for bringing in some of the Mueller report because this is a pattern.""""What we're seeing in Ukraine is the same pattern as what we saw with the Mueller report,"" she said. ""And so, if it's the same pattern, it might make sense.""Other Democrats are unsure what to do.Rep. Karen Bass of California told CNN she's ""concerned"" about the episodes of alleged obstruction but is ""way more concerned about the President attempting to throw the next election."" ""The question is with this President -- there's so much,"" she said. "
Houston police chief says criticism of GOP lawmakers over guns is 'not political',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/houston-police-chief-art-acevedo-republicans/index.html,"""To the people who say this is political -- this is not political. Death is not political -- you see, death is final,"" Acevedo told CNN during an interview in Houston. ""So the question is simple: Do you, Senator (Ted) Cruz support closing the boyfriend loophole that's in that (Violence Against Women Act) law, yes or no? Because if you look at the response from the elected officials in the Senate, not one of them addressed the loophole. You know why? Because you're on the wrong side of history. That's why.""While federal law bars spouses, ex-spouses, live-in partners and people who have children together from possessing a firearm if they have a domestic violence conviction, it does not apply similar constraints to dating partners in what's known as the ""boyfriend loophole."" An outspoken advocate on the issue of domestic violence, Acevedo on Monday slammed Texas Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, for not pushing to close the loophole, as the Houston Police Department mourned the death of Sgt. Chris Brewster. He was shot and killed while responding to a call from a woman who said her boyfriend was armed and assaulting her.""I don't want to hear about how much they support law enforcement,"" the police chief said on Monday. ""I don't want to hear about how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives yet, we all know in law enforcement that one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House and getting the Violence Against Women's Act (passed) is because the NRA doesn't like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends. And who killed our sergeant? A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you're either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you're here for the (National Rifle Association).""He continued: ""I don't want to see their little smug faces talking about how much they care about law enforcement when I'm burying a sergeant because they don't want to piss off the NRA,"" he said. ""Make up your minds, whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers, the gun lobby, or the children that are getting gunned down in this country every single day.""Congressional responseOn Capitol Hill, Cornyn told CNN on Wednesday that Acevedo was ""mistaken"" by invoking the Violence Against Women Act, arguing that laws are already in place to prevent those with domestic abuse convictions in Texas from owning firearms. Texas law prohibits a person convicted of a misdemeanor for family violence from possessing or transferring firearms and ammunition for five years. And federal law says a person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is prohibited from possessing any firearm or ammunition.In a statement, Cruz argued Acevedo was playing politics.""It's unfortunate the chief of police in Houston seems more focused on trying to advance his own political ambitions than on supporting the brave men and women of HPD (Houston Police Department),"" he said. ""The fact is that this killer was a criminal whom federal law already prohibited from having a gun.""The suspect in Brewster's killing has a 2015 conviction of assaulting a family member, according to public records. ""Under current law the shooter would've been legally disqualified from purchasing a firearm,"" Cornyn said. ""So I regret (Acevedo) took the occasion, the sad occasion, of the officer's murder to try to make a political statement that was factually wrong.""Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994, has stalled in Congress. The bill provides grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault and domestic violence and prevention, among other things.In April, the Democratic-led House voted to reauthorize the act after it lapsed earlier this year -- and added language to apply many provisions to dating partners. Some Republicans at the time objected to the bill for several reasons, including the inclusion of a provision that would close the ""boyfriend loophole,"" prohibiting dating partners convicted of assault or stalking from purchasing firearms.The future of the Violence Against Women ActDiscussions in the Senate for a bipartisan version of the bill have fallen apart. Last month, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa introduced her own version of the Violence Against Women Act that extends the law by 10 years while Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California introduced a Senate version of the House bill.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN on Capitol Hill he hopes there can be a bipartisan compromise and hopes it could be reauthorized permanently.""I mean we seem to be stuck here,"" he said on Wednesday when asked if a negotiation could be reached by the end of the year. ""I was hoping that Sen(s). Ernst and Feinstein could get there from here, but we'll keep trying.""Democrats and gun advocates have criticized Senate Republicans for prolonging action on gun violence.When asked about criticism that Senate Republicans are delaying action on the Violence Against Women Act to avoid angering the NRA, Graham said: ""I don't believe that.""""I think what's going on here is you're having a lot of concepts, social policy changes that are really not at the heart of the Violence Against Women (Act) so there's probably blame to go around to all sides,"" Graham told CNN.The Houston Police Officers' Union Board on Monday issued a memo to union members criticizing Acevedo for making ""political statements"" in the wake of Brewster's death and called for Acevedo to apologize to the Houston Police Department for ""hijacking this somber moment.""""The fact that Chief Acevedo chose that moment to make a political statement on guns, is nothing short of offensive and inappropriate. There is a time and place for every discussion and this was neither the time nor the place,"" according to a copy of the memo obtained by CNN. ""We are all grieving for Chris and the focus should be on him and his family and not on the Chief's agenda."""
Nunes disputes claim that he met with former Ukrainian prosecutor to get dirt on Bidens,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/nunes-lawsuit-defamation-cnn-ukraine/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Rep. Devin Nunes is disputing claims made by the lawyer of an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani regarding an alleged trip he made last year. The lawyer, Joseph Bondy, said his client, Lev Parnas was told by a former Ukrainian prosecutor about a meeting with Nunes in Vienna last year to discuss efforts to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, denied the claim in a defamation lawsuit filed in federal court in Virginia against CNN, which first published the assertions made by Bondy. The suit was filed on the same day that the House Intelligence Committee issued a report on its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.Parnas was indicted this fall for making false statements, falsifying campaign records and conspiracy to funnel foreign money into US campaigns. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. CNN had first reported last month that, according to his attorney, Parnas was willing to tell Congress about what he says were Nunes' efforts to dig up dirt on Biden, including that Nunes met with Viktor Shokin, a former Ukrainian prosecutor. Shokin has been at the center of the interactions between Giuliani and Parnas as they sought ways to push for an investigation into Biden, the Democratic presidential front-runner.Shokin was ousted from his position in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders, including then-vice president Biden, over concerns that Shokin was not pursuing corruption cases.Bondy has publicly pushed for his client to find ways to help House impeachment investigators as he fights criminal charges in New York.But in the lawsuit, Nunes refuted the story of meeting Shokin, asserting that he never went to Vienna in December 2018, has never met Shokin, and hadn't talked to Parnas around that time in late 2018. Instead, Nunes says he was on a trip to Libya and Malta. As part of his lawsuit, Nunes provided photographs of himself meeting officials in those countries between November 30 and December 3, 2018. He says he never traveled to Vienna, where Bondy says, according to his client, Nunes met Shokin.Congressional travel records show that Nunes and three aides traveled to Europe from November 30 to December 3, 2018. The records do not specify that Nunes and his staff went to Vienna or Austria, and Nunes was not required to disclose the exact details of the trip.Nunes also claims he has ""never met Parnas."" He also says he ""never worked with Parnas, other Ukrainians, or anyone else to dig up dirt on Biden or other Democrats in Ukraine,"" according to his complaint.On Tuesday, Bondy stood by his client's account, telling CNN that if called as a witness, ""Lev would testify that Shokin told him he had met with Devin Nunes."" Nunes filed his lawsuit the same day that the House Intelligence Committee released its report on the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump's attempts to secure Ukraine's aid in digging up dirt on his political opponents. That report includes phone records that include evidence of calls between Nunes and Parnas in April 2019, in addition to Giuliani and others involved in spreading conspiracy theories about the Bidens in Ukraine.The committee report alleges that the calls were part of a wider coordinated effort by Giuliani and others to push ""false narratives"" in news stories about Ukraine.Lawsuit filedNunes' complaint on Tuesday is the latest in a string of lawsuits the California Republican congressman has filed against news organizations and other entities. Nunes filed lawsuits earlier this year against the newspaper chain McClatchy, Hearst Magazines, and Twitter.Before publishing the story and airing a TV segment about it, CNN approached Nunes twice on Capitol Hill, and reached out to him and his office for comment multiple times through his spokesman. Nunes responded to questions telling a CNN reporter, ""I don't talk to you in this lifetime or the next lifetime,"" and reiterated later he would not acknowledge questions from CNN.After the story published, Nunes disputed Bondy's claims to the right-wing news website Breitbart.In his lawsuit filed Tuesday, Nunes says that Parnas is not a trustworthy source, calling him a ""fraudster and a hustler.""CNN has not yet responded in court to Nunes' complaint. A CNN spokesperson declined to comment for this story.Federal prosecutors in New York on Monday said they are ""likely"" to file additional charges in the case against Parnas, and his associate Igor Fruman.In court on Monday, Parnas' attorney told the judge his client ""has indicated that he wishes to comply with the House Intelligence subpoena,"" and asked prosecutors to give him copies of material they took from Parnas for their case, so that he can turn it over to Congress.

Why the next 100 days are critical for Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/trump-100-days-reelection-analysis/index.html," (CNN)The next 100 days will be critical to understanding whether President Donald Trump will win a second term in office. His approval rating has been consistently low during his first term. Yet his supporters could always point out that approval ratings before an election year have not historically been correlated with reelection success. But by mid-March of an election year, approval ratings, though, become more predictive. Presidents with low approval ratings in mid-March of an election year tend to lose, while those with strong approval ratings tend to win in blowouts and those with middling approval ratings usually win by small margins.Let's start with where Trump is right now: an approval rating in the low 40s. Since World War II, two presidents have had an approval rating at or below 45% in mid-March of an election year. George H.W. Bush had an approval rating at 39%, while Jimmy Carter's was at 45% and falling fast. Both of them went on to lose reelection by greater than 5 points. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there have been five presidents with an approval rating of 55% or above. There was Bill Clinton at 55%, Ronald Reagan at 55%, Richard Nixon at 58%, Dwight Eisenhower at 72% and Lyndon Johnson at 80%. All of these presidents won their elections by nine points or greater. Finally, we have the group of presidents with approval ratings between between 46% and 54%. This includes Gerald Ford at 47%, Barack Obama at 47%, George W. Bush at 49% and Harry Truman at 51%. All of their elections were decided by less than 5 points.Ford didn't win.I should point out that these groups I laid out are a little arbitrary. The correlation is high, but not too high between reelection margins and mid-March of election year approval rating. Reagan's approval rating, for example was equal to Clinton's, though Reagan's reelection margin (18 points) was about twice as much as Clinton's (9 points). It's certainly within the margin of error that Trump wins reelection even if his approval rating stays where it is by mid-March of next year. The Reagan vs. Clinton comparison, though, should be a major warning to Trump. Reagan won by a larger margin than Clinton in part because economic growth was very strong in Reagan's reelection year. As FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver pointed out back in 2012, reelection outcomes are predicted well when you combine approval ratings with job growth. To use another example besides Reagan, poor job growth in 1980 helped sink both Carter's approval rating and his reelection hopes.So what happens if Trump's approval rating is the same in 100 days as it is now and the economy grows at the same rate it currently is through the election? Based on history, Trump would be forecasted to lose by a few points.Like when only accounting for approval ratings, it would be a race within the margin of error. Still, you can clearly see how history points to an uphill climb for Trump. Combine that with the fact that his approval ratings have been consistently low, and there's no reason to believe the underlying political environment will change dramatically by Election Day if things hold over the next 100 days. That leaves us with the big unknown of who Trump's opponent will be in the general election. Who that is will ultimately help to determine whether Trump is able to beat his poor fundamentals. "
Booker and Castro focus on lack of diversity in 2020 race post-Harris exit,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/booker-castro-lack-of-diversity-2020/index.html,"Washington (CNN)To New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Secretary Julián Castro, Sen. Kamala Harris' exit from the 2020 presidential race is a gut check moment for the Democratic Party.The two Democrats are seizing on Harris -- the only black woman running for president -- dropping out of the race to raise the question about what the prospect of this month's Democratic debate featuring only white candidates could mean for a party the not only prizes diversity, but relies on black voters.For the candidates, the push is both practical and political.Both are a long way from qualifying for the December Democratic debate, so looking for attention around the lack of diversity atop the Democratic field makes tactical sense. The duo are also markedly cash-strapped, so fundraising off Harris' exit is not only sensible, it's necessary.Beyond that, though, Castro, who is Latino, and Booker, who is black, are asking a deeper political question about the party as the December debate currently only features former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer -- all of whom are white. (Both businessman Andrew Yang, who is Asian, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Asian and Pacific Islander, are one poll away from qualifying for the contest in Los Angeles.)Booker has expressed deep frustration -- even anger -- at Harris' departure, noting with concern that there are now ""more billionaires than black people"" in the race for president, a talking point aimed at his Democratic rivals Bloomberg and businessman Tom Steyer. ""What message is that sending, that we heralded the most diverse field in our history, and now we're seeing people like [Harris] dropping out of this campaign?"" Booker said Thursday in Iowa, as he kicked off a swing through the state. ""This is not about one candidate,"" he added. ""It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.""Likewise, Castro has expressed astonishment that a late-in-the-process Democratic debate could feature only white candidates, using it to question the process that the Democratic National Committee has used to ensure the debate did not include every candidate running.""What we're staring at is a DNC debate stage with no people of color on it,"" Castro told reporters this week. ""That does not reflect the diversity of our party or our country. We need to do better than that.""The debate over diversity is a complicated one for top Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Most operatives agree that the party needs to set standards on who makes the debate stage as a way to allow the candidates getting the most support to get the most time on the debate stage.But there is also widespread acknowledgement that the party needs to showcase its diversity, especially considering black voters make up the backbone of the party. In 2016, for example, black and Latino voters made up 23% of the electorate, with 89% of black voters and 66% of Latinos backing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.""If the December debate stage is all white, mostly older, and mostly male, the Democratic Party has a serious crisis on its hands,"" said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic operative who recently worked for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.""After we presented a historic field, the cracks in the primary system have presented themselves at every turn -- money doesn't equal enthusiasm, polls don't sample enough voters of color, not enough pundits understand cultural context of their candidacy,"" said Rocketto. ""Why can candidates of color can only garner support when they are in danger of being on stage at all?""The DNC said in a statement that the process has been its most inclusive.""This has been the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires,"" DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa told CNN in a statement. ""We are proud of this historic and diverse field with 20 candidates participating in the first two debates and at least 10 candidates in each debate after that. While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process. Nobody who has failed to reach 4% at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We've never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.""Booker and Castro have been sounding the alarm for months now on the need for Democrats to focus on building and exciting such a coalition.Castro, as he struggled to gain attention in Iowa and New Hampshire, slammed the party for allowing two predominantly white states -- Iowa and New Hampshire -- to be the first to vote in the process.""We need to change the whole game, there is no reason that Iowa and New Hampshire should go first, two states that hardly have any black people in them,"" Castro said in California on Thursday.Booker, during a July speech at the National Urban League Conference in Indianapolis, also warned that Democrats concerned about electability should not focus solely on winning back the white working class voters who defected in 2016 to support Trump — but must also nominate a candidate who could energize African Americans who did not vote in 2016, a fact that contributed to Clinton's surprising shortfall in key Midwestern states. After Harris' shock decision to end her campaign, however, Booker's team believes Democrats might now begin to heed his warning. ""To see such a qualified black woman not even end up as one of the choices on the ballot is a moment that I think is leading to some introspection about where we are in this primary and what we need to win next November,"" Booker's campaign manager Addisu Demissie said.It's not just about waking up complacent voters, Booker's team believes, but also reorienting the thinking of a Democratic Party that has heaped its focus on appealing to moderate white voters, more so than turning out black voters who were at the core of the winning Obama coalition. ""There's an education that needs to be done with voters and donors and reporters alike on that,"" Demissie said, ""and that's part of what a campaign is."" Both Castro's and Booker's campaigns have said they have seen a rush of support in the wake of Harris getting out, something they attribute to voters wanting to see diverse options on the stage.A Castro aide said Thursday that they have raised more than $200,000 since Harris dropped out, one of the biggest surges Castro has had since failing to qualify for the November debate.For Booker, Wednesday -- the day after Harris got out -- marked his biggest day of online fundraising to date, an aide said. All told, 11,000 new donors have contributed to Booker's campaign since Harris dropped out. The moment might be coming too late for both, however.With zero of four qualifying polls needed to earn a spot in the December debate, Booker and Castro are likely to be excluded from the stage. This is the first time Booker won't qualify for a debate and it's unclear what will happen for his campaign after that.To Karen Finney, a senior aide to Clinton's 2016 campaign and senior adviser to Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in 2018, Harris' getting out and the lack of diversity atop the field is a ""gut check moment"" for the party and could impact the party for years to come.""What sets this cycle apart from others is the strong desire among Democratic base voters to beat Donald Trump,"" Finney said. ""And yet, time and again, (voters) continue to say that a white man may be the best person to take on Trump; so we all have to check our biases, conscious and unconscious about why that is.""She added: ""It also means for voters, especially black and brown voters, those voices and faces are missing from the stage and it sets us back to some degree in sending a message to young people about who can be president, what a leader looks like."""
McKinsey tells Pete Buttigieg he can disclose his clients,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/mckinsey-pete-buttigieg/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The elite consulting firm McKinsey & Company has informed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg he can name the clients he worked for during his three years at the company. The news comes days after Buttigieg released a timeline of his years working for the firm from 2007 to 2010 following calls from some of his presidential opponents to be more transparent. The calls came after reports about McKinsey's work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement on projects along the US-Mexico border. Buttigieg had said a nondisclosure agreement prevents him from naming his clients. A McKinsey spokesman said Monday that the nondisclosure agreement remains intact, but the mayor ""may disclose the identity of the clients he served while at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010.""""When clients come to McKinsey, they expect impartiality and expertise rendered on a confidential basis. ... Confidentiality agreements therefore play an important role in the work of professional services firms like ours, which depend on fundamental trust with clients,"" the spokesman said. ""At the same time, we recognize the unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign.""The spokesman added: ""After receiving permission from the relevant clients, we have informed Mr. Buttigieg that he may disclose the identity of the clients he served while at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010. Any description of his work for those clients still must not disclose confidential, proprietary or classified information obtained during the course of that work, or violate any security clearance.""Buttigieg said last week that his work at McKinsey included a nonprofit health insurance provider in Michigan, a grocery and retail chain in Toronto, a consumer goods retail chain in Chicago, a project on energy efficiency and climate change in Connecticut and an environmental nonprofit in California.""To the best of my recollection, these are all of my client engagements during my time with the firm, but a full release from McKinsey will allow the American public to see the full scope of my work,"" Buttigieg said in the statement.And the spokesman for McKinsey backed up the mayor's claim, stating, ""We can further confirm that the clients Mr. Buttigieg described in his statement on Friday, December 6 are all of the clients he served during his time at McKinsey.""Lis Smith, Buttigieg's spokeswoman, said in response to McKinsey that the mayor will release his list of clients ""soon.""""And in this instance, @PeteButtigieg is being transparent about his private sector work AND keeping his word- two things you will never hear said about our current President,"" Smith tweeted.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the primary Democratic opponent who called on Buttigieg to release his list of clients, telling reporters in Boston, ""I think that voters want to know about possible conflicts of interests.""The New York Times also published an editorial on the presidential candidate to release his clients.According to the campaign's earlier release, Buttigieg served a nonprofit health insurance provider for three months, focusing on on-the-job training for savings in administration and overhead costs. In 2008, he worked in consumer goods -- focused on grocery pricing for a client in Toronto and helping a consumer goods store in Chicago investigating the market for energy-efficient home products -- before taking a leave of absence from the firm to work on a Democratic campaign for Indiana governor.Buttigieg spent part of 2009 working out of Washington with visits to Iraq and Afghanistan on a project ""focused on increasing employment and entrepreneurship in those countries' economies."" He would later return to Afghanistan as part of a deployment with the Navy Reserve in 2014.The release comes on the same day that the mayor announced he would be allowing press into all of his future fundraisers -- something he had not done to date -- and releasing his list of top fundraisers for the campaign."
DNC raises concerns about Facebook's ability to catch trolls,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/dnc-facebook-trolls/index.html,"New York  (CNN)The Democratic National Committee wrote to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg before Thanksgiving to raise concerns about the company's ability to catch online trolls and to that it change its political ad policy, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. The letter detailing concerns about Facebook's detection of nefarious campaigns on its platform comes just two months before the Iowa caucuses. After Russia targeted the 2016 presidential election using Facebook, the company hired a team, which includes former intelligence officials, to root out misinformation campaigns and coordinated online troll groups. Seema Nanda, the DNC's CEO, wrote in the November 21 letter that a small in-house team the DNC has monitoring online misinformation had uncovered and reported to Facebook ""at least nine foreign, inauthentic account networks targeting Americans with anti-Democratic false news content.""The DNC said all of the campaigns appear to be commercially -- rather than politically -- motivated, but still ""have the effect of warping the political perceptions of American voters and hurting Democratic candidates' electoral chances.""""It's concerning that we're able to uncover these terms-of-service-violating operations on a fairly regular basis, with a team far smaller than Facebook's. Considering Facebook's enormous financial resources and the stakes of the upcoming elections, we'd ask that you dedicate additional capacity to enforce your terms of service against these types of malicious actors,"" Nanda wrote. Facebook had no immediate comment on the specifics of the letter Tuesday, but the company has previously confirmed to CNN that it has investigated and taken action on accounts as a result of tips from the DNC. Earlier this year, Facebook and Twitter took part in a training session organized by the DNC for presidential campaign staff about how campaigns could share details of suspicious activity with the companies. Facebook's team searching for what suspicious behavior on its platform has had a number of successes over the past year, including recently thwarting a network of accounts that appeared to be linked to the same Russian troll group that meddled in the 2016 US presidential election. The accounts appeared to be laying the groundwork for 2020. The DNC led its letter to Sandberg with Facebook's controversial political ad policy. The company does not fact-check ads from politicians. ""Current Facebook policy allows politicians to place demonstrable lies in front of voters via paid ads. This type of elite disinformation, from politicians many voters trust, is one of the most insidious and damaging forms of disinformation. Facebook's advanced analytics and targeting capabilities, furthermore, allow candidates to direct disinformation at the populations most susceptible to it,"" Nanda wrote. Nanda said Facebook should fact-check ads, but it should not go as far as banning political ads entirely -- a policy Twitter adopted amid increased scrutiny of how Silicon Valley handles political speech. ""Banning political ads or severely inhibiting targeting capabilities on Facebook would not be in our party's best interest nor in the best interest of promoting voter participation,"" she wrote. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's decision not to fact-check political ads."
5 takeaways from the Democratic report teeing up Trump's historic impeachment,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/five-takeaways-democratic-report-impeachment/index.html,"Washington (CNN)House Democrats on Tuesday released a 300-page report presenting what they call ""overwhelming"" evidence that President Donald Trump abused his official powers by pressuring Ukraine to help his reelection and then obstructed the inquiry into his actions.The report, from the House Intelligence Committee, offered a compelling narrative of how Trump used the powers of his office to manipulate US foreign policy and how he tried to allegedly coerce the new Ukrainian president into announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.Here are five takeaways from the report, which will be on full display in the coming days, as Democrats hold more public hearings about the findings of their investigation.Critical phone records were subpoenaedThe Democratic report largely rehashed weeks of public testimony and private depositions from key witnesses. But there was at least one major surprise: House Democrats subpoenaed phone records and uncovered new details about how Trump's allies coordinated their Ukraine efforts.There was a ""coordinated effort"" by Trump's allies to push ""false narratives publicly,"" the report said. The proof: Phone calls at key moments between the White House, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, indicted Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas, conservative columnist John Solomon and Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.The phone records are labeled in the report's end notes as coming from AT&T, and markings in the report indicate that Democrats obtained the logs in September, before the public hearings.""Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies. In all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law,"" said Jim Greer, a spokesman for AT&T, which owns CNN.It's unclear why Democrats didn't showcase this information earlier in their investigation. But they might rely on the records as they move onto the next phase and an eventual Senate trial.Democrats raise the stakes for NunesAs revealed by the phone records, Nunes was closer to the Ukraine affair than he let on.The report shed new light on Nunes' ties to key players in the shadow campaign to pressure Ukraine. This includes phone calls between Nunes and Parnas, who has been charged with illegally funneling foreign donations to Republican lawmakers in 2018 (He pleaded not guilty).""It is deeply concerning that at a time when the President of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chair and California Democrat.For Nunes, this puts him closer to a cast of characters that are under criminal investigation. The probe of Parnas and his associates is continuing, and federal investigators are also looking at Giuliani's financial relationships to Parnas, and his overseas dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere.Nunes rebuffed multiple requests for comment from CNN after the report was released. The breadth of Trump's alleged obstructionIn the report, Democrats outline what they see as efforts from the Trump administration to obstruct the impeachment inquiry through blocking witnesses from testifying, refusing to hand over documents and intimidating witnesses.""The evidence of the President's misconduct is overwhelming,"" the report said, ""and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress.""Dozens of witnesses refused to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, following Trump's directive, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. These were key players in several elements of the scandal, including the implementation of Trump's freeze of much-needed US military aid for Ukraine.The State Department, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy refused to comply with Democratic subpoenas for documents, emails and other relevant notes, the report noted. So did the White House and the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the White House.The report also accuses Trump of engaging ""in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate witnesses ... raising grave concerns about potential violations of the federal obstruction statute."" This included public attacks against former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, the anonymous whistleblower, a senior aide to Vice President Mike Pence, and others. Anything you say will be used against youIn many ways the report was an homage to Miranda rights, in which a suspect is warned by law enforcement that ""anything you say can -- and will -- be used against you.""Clearly, Trump and his allies did not heed this warning.The report cites a series of public comments from Giuliani, including television interviews, comments to reporters and Twitter posts. Democrat used all of these comments to hammer Giuliani for ""putting pressure on Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit his 2020 reelection campaign"" and said they prove Giuliani was working for Trump's personal benefit.""We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,"" Giuliani told The New York Times of his exploits in Ukraine, which was cited in the report.Democrats also highlighted Giuliani's tweet that, ""everything I did was to discover evidence to defend my client against false charges."" He has repeated this throughout the investigation.Mulvaney's words are also used in the report to support the notion that aid for Ukraine was tied to investigations. They referred to his watershed press conference in October, where he brazenly admitted the quid pro quo and said the press should ""get over it.""The report also points to Trump's own words to lay out the case that he did, in fact, want Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. In the Trump-Zelensky call on July 25, Trump asked for ""a favor"" and went on to discuss the investigations into his political rivals, including the Bidens.""The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct,"" the preface of the report said.What about the whistleblower?Throughout the reports, Democrats make reference to the whistleblower, who filed a complaint in August about Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he pressed Zelensky to launch investigations into his domestic political rivals.But Democrats didn't bring up the whistleblower to discuss that complaint, which is what untimely led to the impeachment inquiry in September. This stands in contrast to the report from House Republicans, released on Monday, which is filled with criticism for the whistleblower.Democrats only mentioned the whistleblower to accuse Trump and others of obstruction.In the first mention of the whistleblower, Democrats attack the acting director of national intelligence for taking ""the unprecedented step of withholding the complaint from the Congressional Intelligence Committees,"" in coordination with the White House.The report devotes several sections to lay out how Trump allegedly ""attack(ed)"" and ""threatened"" the whistleblower by questioning their motives and publicly encouraging the press to reveal their identify. The whistleblower is legally protected from professional reprisals."
Washington Post: Barr's handpicked prosecutor tells watchdog he doesn't have evidence Russia probe was a setup,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/william-barr-russia-conspiracy-theory-inspector-general/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The prosecutor chosen by Attorney General William Barr to examine how US agencies investigated President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign has said he cannot provide evidence to the Justice Department's inspector general in support of a theory that the case was a setup, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz contacted multiple US intelligence agencies and Connecticut federal prosecutor John Durham -- who Barr appointed to lead a separate review of the 2016 investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia -- to ask whether a Maltese professor who communicated with a Trump campaign staffer was actually a US intelligence asset attempting to trap the campaign, the people told The Post. The intelligence agencies said the professor was not their asset and Durham told Horowitz he didn't have evidence that would refute the inspector general's findings on that point, the people said. Horowitz's report, which is due to be released next Monday, is expected to conclude that the FBI's investigation was legally predicated, despite errors and potential wrongdoing by some lower-level FBI employees involved in it, CNN reported last month.The report is also expected to conclude that Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, was appropriately targeted for surveillance and the FBI appropriately disassociated itself from Christopher Steele, a former British spy who's the author of the infamous dossier about President Donald Trump, after leaks and contacts with the media were uncovered.But despite this, Barr -- a longtime skeptic of the Russia probe, and particularly the FBI's tactics to investigate Trump campaign associates -- has told conservative allies Horowitz's report won't be the last word on the matter.Instead, the attorney general has told allies to wait for Durham's investigation, which he believes will be more complete.Durham is a Trump appointee who has investigated numerous public corruption cases under Republican and Democratic administrations. He was appointed by then-Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate corruption surrounding the use of FBI informants in Boston in the late 1990s, and later called on to investigate the CIA's destruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations in 2008.CNN's Laura Jarrett, Evan Perez and David Shortell contributed to this report.

The Point: Why world leaders seemingly joking about Donald Trump will drive the President crazy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/trump-macron-trudeau-boris-johnson/index.html,"""He takes a ... 40-minute press conference at the top,"" Trudeau can be heard saying while the other leaders nod. ""You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""While it wasn't immediately clear that the group was talking about Trump behind his back, it was very hard to conclude they are talking about anyone else. After all, Trump did spend extended periods of time talking to the media during a series of bilateral meetings Tuesday with Macron and Trudeau. And Trump clearly believes the group was talking about him.""He's two-faced,"" Trump said Wednesday morning when asked about the comments Trudeau made apparently about him. Trump then, weirdly, added of Trudeau: ""I find him to be a very nice guy."" (Trump also canceled a press conference scheduled for later Wednesday before he leaves the NATO gathering in London.)Trudeau admitted Wednesday that he and the other world leaders were talking about Trump.""Last night I made reference to the fact that there was an unscheduled press conference before my meeting with President Trump. I was happy to be part of it but it was certainly notable,"" Trudeau said during a Wednesday press conference.This episode is almost uniquely positioned to make Trump very angry -- an anger that flashed with the ""two-faced"" comment. Here's why: Trump has spent his entire life feeling as though he is on the outside looking in at the cool kids, or as he has taken to calling them, ""the elites."" His father, Fred, was a real estate developer, yes, but in Queens, not Manhattan. When Trump became a developer in his own right, he went directly into the heart of Manhattan to build, but even then he wasn't accepted in the old money clubs and societies. (To quote Trump supporter Kanye West: ""But I know they don't want me in the damn club/They even make me show I.D. to get inside of Sam's Club."") When Trump came to Washington earlier this decade seeking to dip his toe into the political waters, he was mocked by former President Barack Obama and comedian Seth Meyers.Trump regularly riffed on his sense of alienation -- and how angry it made him -- both as a candidate for president and while on the stump for GOP candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. Here's Trump from a speech in North Dakota during that election:""I hate it. I meet these people they call them 'the elite.' These people. I look at them, I say, 'That's elite?' We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we're smarter than they are, and they say they're elite? We're the elite. You're the elite. We're the elite.""Given that lens on the world, you can easily understand why this episode will drive Trump crazy. This is yet another club -- Macron, Trudeau, Johnson -- that doesn't want him as a member. And not only that, but they appear to be in their little club mocking him. It's everything that Trump hates. It's, in his mind, the story of his life. Snobs who think they are better than him, smarter than him, just superior.  Because this video plays into a longstanding grievance that Trump has with, well, the world, it seems likely that his condemnation of Trudeau as ""two-faced"" won't be the last thing we hear on this front. Remember that Trump is about to get on a long flight back to the United States -- and that he'll have access to his Twitter account. Stay tuned."
House Judiciary Committee releases report outlining historical arguments for impeachment,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/house-judiciary-committee-report-impeachment-historical-arguments/index.html," (CNN)The House Judiciary Committee on Saturday released a report ahead of Monday's impeachment hearing laying out historical arguments for impeachment.The report does not accuse President Donald Trump of committing impeachable offenses, but it lays the groundwork for Monday's hearing, where evidence against Trump will be presented by the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, as well as the possible introduction of articles of impeachment next week.""The Framers worst nightmare is what we are facing in this very moment,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. ""President Trump abused his power, betrayed our national security, and corrupted our elections, all for personal gain. The Constitution details only one remedy for this misconduct: impeachment. The safety and security of our nation, our democracy, and future generations hang in the balance if we do not address this misconduct. In America, no one is above the law, not even the President.""The report is an update to the Judiciary Committee reports that were issued in 1974 and 1998 during the impeachment proceedings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.""The earlier reports remain useful points of reference, but no longer reflect the best available learning on questions relating to presidential impeachment,"" Nadler wrote in a forward introducing the report. ""Further, they do not address several issues of constitutional law with particular relevance to the ongoing impeachment inquiry respecting President Donald J. Trump."""
Georgia governor expected to defy Trump and appoint Atlanta businesswoman to Senate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/brian-kemp-kelly-loeffler-senate-johnny-isakson-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN)On the Sunday before Thanksgiving the Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, made a secret trip to the White House to introduce his pick for the next senator from Georgia to President Donald Trump.A Trump-aligned conservative wrapping up his first year in office, Kemp had brought along Kelly Loeffler, an Atlanta businesswoman and political novice whom he wanted to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who will retire at the end of the year. Former White House aide Nick Ayers, an important player in Georgia Republican politics, came along to sell Trump on Loeffler.But the charm offensive didn't work. An official familiar with the meeting told CNN the President was frustrated and advised Kemp against tapping Loeffler. He told Kemp he wanted him to select Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and a vocal critic of the impeachment effort.The scene was unusual -- governors, even Republicans in the age of Trump, rarely make overt appeals to the President about Senate appointments. Stranger still, Kemp looks prepared to buck the President, discarding the boost-the-base political strategy they both embraced in 2018 and 2016 for an appeal to the more moderate, suburban voters Republicans have lost.Kemp will announce on Wednesday that Loeffler will succeed Isakson, according to two people familiar with the selection process.Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who's the Senate majority leader, told reporters Tuesday that he would be ""behind"" Loeffler and said she would be ""terrific"" -- a sure sign the Washington GOP establishment is welcoming her selection. She'll also have the support of the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee in next year's election, a source familiar tells CNN.Republicans in Georgia say whoever Kemp picks to fill Isakson's seat has important implications for the future of the GOP. Selecting Loeffler suggests Georgia Republicans are starting to look beyond Trump's coalition for the long-term health of their party.A strategic selectionUnder Georgia law, whoever replaces Isakson will have to run in November 2020 to serve out the last two years of his term. They could have a lot of competition. Georgia will hold a jungle primary for the Isakson seat, meaning multiple candidates from both parties can challenge Kemp's appointee.Whoever emerges as the winner next year will have to run again two years later, in 2022. They'll have to be popular enough to fend off any Republican challengers who might split the GOP vote, and also help the party weather shifting political coalitions and the state's changing demographics, which Republicans worry could threaten their statewide dominance.That's a lot to place on a first-time politician like Loeffler.Several Republican operatives in Georgia say Loeffler could be a smart selection as the state GOP grapples with how to attract moderate suburban voters. A ""white male conservative doesn't bring anything to the ticket,"" one operative told CNN. If Loeffler is appointed and wins election in 2020, she'll be the first woman elected to the Senate in state history. A 49-year-old executive at a commodities trading firm in Atlanta, Loeffler is a prominent Republican donor who considered running for the Senate in 2014. Despite co-owning the WNBA's Atlanta Dream and being familiar to the Atlanta business community, Loeffler has little statewide name recognition.But she is an attractive candidate for other reasons, including her ability to self-fund her campaign.With Republicans looking at Trump and Sen. David Perdue (who is up for reelection) at the top of their ticket in Georgia next fall, some say Loeffler inserts some much-needed diversity. ""On paper, she fits the bill of what you're looking for -- somebody who can bring the suburban women vote in, and who's got a good story to tell,"" said the GOP operative.Another Republican strategist familiar with Georgia said Loeffler ""couldn't have a better résumé to appeal to the suburban Atlanta voter.""But with no political track record or proven campaign skills, Loeffler presents a risk for Republicans, too. ""Time will tell how she performs on the stump,"" said the strategist.Winning back the suburbsAppealing to suburban voters has been a big part of the GOP's rise in the Peach State. Georgia was the last Southern state to elect its first Republican governor when Sonny Perdue won in 2002, and the party's strength in Atlanta's growing suburbs delivered GOP majorities in the state Legislature and congressional delegation.  But that strength has waned recently as Democrats have become more competitive in Georgia's suburbs. That strength was on display in last year's governor's race, when Democrat Stacey Abrams came within 2 percentage points of beating Kemp. Abrams won the Atlanta suburban counties of Cobb and Gwinnett, which were once considered Republican strongholds. In much the same way in 2016, Trump lost Cobb and Gwinnett after Mitt Romney had easily won them in 2012.""Republicans in Georgia lost suburban voters who identify as Republican but don't like Trump,"" said Erick Erickson, the Atlanta-based talk-radio host and conservative activist. ""Kemp himself saw a loss of support from those voters because he was perceived as being Trump's candidate."" Rejecting Trump? In picking Loeffler, Kemp would reject not only Trump's personal advice but also the White House's broader political strategy to maximize Republican base voters in 2020. Some Georgia Republicans say it could redound to Kemp's benefit. The GOP operative told CNN that Kemp will have the ability to say to swing voters in 2022 that he was not a puppet of Trump.That only works, however, if Republican voters in Georgia get on board with Loeffler and she wins the election outright next fall. Some conservative interest groups and media outlets have raised concerns that Loeffler does not pass certain ideological litmus tests, particularly on abortion.Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who's a close ally of Trump's, has called on Kemp to appoint Collins and blasted the governor's expected plans to defy Trump.Kemp responded to these charges, without revealing his selection, by tweeting last week: ""The idea that I would appoint someone to the U.S. Senate that is NOT pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, pro-freedom, and 100% supportive of our President (and his plan to Keep America Great) is ridiculous.""Whether a Trump ally like Collins -- who has not ruled out running for the seat in 2020 -- would actually jump in could depend a lot on the President's acceptance of Loeffler.To that point, Loeffler has one key asset in her favor: money. Last month, she donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising operation to help reelect the President. ""If that's a rehearsal, wait until you see the dance,"" said the Republican operative.CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes and Nick Valencia contributed to this story."
Democrats to lay out articles of impeachment Tuesday following contentious hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/judiciary-committee-impeachment-hearing/index.html," (CNN)House Democrats plan to move forward with at least two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, one on abuse of power and the other obstruction of Congress, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. A third article on obstruction of justice is still being debated, and the sources cautioned Monday night that plans were still being finalized.Democrats plan to unveil the articles of impeachment on Tuesday morning and will begin debate on them in the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the sources said. The Washington Post was first to report on the two impending articles of impeachment.Leaving a meeting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office Monday evening, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York told reporters there would be an announcement Tuesday morning to lay out articles of impeachment, but wouldn't get into details about their contents.Engel said he expected the announcement would be made by the key Democratic chairs --  Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters of California and Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney of New York.""This is not a happy day,"" Engel said, ""but I think we are doing what we have to do.""The announcement Tuesday will come one day after Nadler accused Trump of putting ""himself before country"" at a chaotic hearing kicking off a two-week sprint for Democrats likely to end in the third impeachment of a president in US history.The hearing was a chance for Democrats to state their case against the President a final time before moving forward with articles of impeachment. Democrats charge that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival while withholding $400 million in US security aide and a one-on-one White House meeting. And they say he obstructed Congress by refusing to provide documents to the committee and instructing officials not to testify in the impeachment inquiry.What's still up for debate are the obstruction of justice allegations detailed in the Mueller report, which Democrats said Monday pointed to a larger pattern of Trump's misconduct.The hearing for Democratic and Republican staff attorneys to present cases for and against Trump's impeachment saw the bitter partisan divide over the impeachment proceedings spilled into the open, with Republican lawmakers vocally protesting Nadler's handling of the hearing and committee staffers even clashing during questioning.LIVE UPDATES: Next phase in Trump impeachment inquiry beginsRepublicans erupted while Democratic Judiciary Committee staff counsel Barry Berke pressed GOP counsel Steve Castor on the Republican report and accused Republicans of inaccurately quoting a witness.""He's badgering the witness,"" said GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, trying to raise an objection to Berke's questioning. When Nadler ruled he wasn't raising a valid objection, Sensenbrenner said: ""The chairman is not in order.""The exchange was one of the many Republican objections that occurred Monday during a lengthy hearing where even the decision to recess prompted multiple party-line roll-call votes. As questioning of the staff attorneys began — which created an odd dynamic where one committee staffer was grilling another — the GOP protests intensified along with the volume of Nadler's gavel banging down to stop the interruptions.""Bang it harder — still doesn't make it right,"" said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, in a shot at Nadler.Democrats used Monday's hearing opportunity to weave the hours of witness testimony to illustrate their narrative that the President abused his office.""If he puts himself before the country in a manner that threatens our democracy, then our oath — our promise to the American people — requires us to come to the defense of the nation,"" said Nadler, a Democrat.Nadler declined to discuss the articles on Monday evening leaving the Judiciary Committee's offices, but he said Republicans only tried to attack the process, not the facts against the President.""The Republicans hardly attempted to defend the President's conduct,"" Nadler said. ""All they talked about from their point of view was the improper process, about (former Vice President Joe) Biden and Burisma and Ukraine. But nothing about defending the President's conduct, and that's probably because the evidence is overwhelming and the conduct indefensible.""Republicans also pointed to witness testimony to argue that Democrats didn't have a case, charging they rushing to impeach Trump in order to beat him in the 2020 election.""This may though become known as the focus-group impeachment,"" Collins said. ""Because we don't have a crime, we don't have anything we can actually pin and nobody understands really what the majority is trying to do except interfere and basically make sure they believe the President can't win next year if he's impeached.""The objections to the hearing began as soon as Nadler started his opening statement, as a protester in the audience shouted down the Judiciary Committee chairman before being removed by US Capitol Police. Republicans on the committee then took up their own objections, demanding a hearing for the witnesses they want to hear from and accusing Nadler of ""a steamroll"" when he ignored their protests.  Republicans knocked House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who led the Intel panel's impeachment inquiry, for not testifying before the Judiciary panel, with staff counsel Daniel Goldman appearing instead to discuss the committee's report.""We want Schiff in that chair, not you,"" shouted Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican.Collins went after Goldman during his questioning over the committee's subpoenas that revealed phone calls of Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, and journalist John Solomon, whose opinion columns in The Hill attacked former US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Goldman said that the committee didn't subpoena either Nunes or Solomon, but that didn't slow the Republican lawmakers' criticisms.""Somebody along the way just didn't all of a sudden have an epiphany ... that these numbers might match,"" Collins said. ""Who ordered it, was it you, or was it Chairman Schiff, and then why was it decided, except for nothing but smear purposes, to be included in the Schiff report?""Monday's hearing is likely to be just the opening act of a week's worth of major Judiciary Committee activity on impeachment, as Democrats are expected to bring forward articles of impeachment that will be debated and voted on in the committee later this week.Nadler declined to say what the committee's next steps would be, saying he was ""not prepared to say anything further about the schedule of the committee beyond today's hearing."" But he concluded the hearing by declaring that Trump's conduct was ""clearly impeachable.""""This committee will proceed accordingly,"" he said.Staff present case for and against TrumpThe diametrically opposing views between Democrats and Republicans on impeachment — where they have failed to agree on basic facts and what they mean — underscores the intense partisan fight that's continued to escalate as an impeachment vote has drawn closer.Both sides found plenty of testimony to back up their case throughout the dozens of hours of witness testimony that occurred in the House Intelligence Committee.Presenting the Democrats' case before he asked questions, Berke described a pattern of Trump's behavior dating back to his call for Russia to find Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 election.""Given what happened with the Department of Justice investigation, given what's happening here, if in fact President Trump can get away with what he did again, our imagination is the only limit to what President Trump may do next or what a future president may do next to try to abuse his or her power to serve his own personal interest over the nation's interest,"" Berke said.Goldman walked through the committee's investigation during his presentation, pointing to testimony Democrats say shows that Trump directed the effort for Ukraine to investigate his political rival while withholding US security aid and a White House meeting. Goldman said that senior officials were all ""in the loop"" about the effort, as US Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified, and he argued Trump's ""determination to solicit of foreign interference in our election continues today.""""It did not end with Russia's support for Trump in 2016, which President Trump invited by asking for his opponent to be hacked by Russia,"" he said. ""And it did not end when his Ukrainian scheme was exposed in September of this year.""Castor laid out his own pattern — one that he says shows the Democrats were working to impeach the President since the day he took office. Castor pointed out all of the Democratic investigations into the President across the House committees, from the testimony of Michael Cohen to the lawsuit to obtain the President's tax returns, to argue the impeachment inquiry has been long in the making.""The record in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry does not show that President Trump abused the power of his office or obstructed Congress,"" Castor said. ""To impeach a president who 63 million people voted for over eight lines in a call transcript is baloney.""Castor argued that Democrats provided ""no direct evidence that President Trump withheld a meeting or security assistance in order to pressure President Zelensky to investigate former VP (Joe) Biden,"" pointing to testimony from special envoy Kurt Volker to argue witnesses did not testify to a quid pro quo. ""Witnesses who testified in the inquiry have denied having awareness of criminal activity or even an impeachable offense,"" he said. ""On the key question of the president's state of mind, there is no clear evidence that President Trump acted with malicious intent."" Debating what to do about MuellerWhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior Democrats have made clear they are proceeding with impeachment, House Democrats are still debating whether the articles should narrowly focus on Ukraine or to expand the scope of the articles to include the allegations detailed by Mueller.While Judiciary Committee Democrats say Trump's conduct documented by Mueller should not be excused, Schiff on Sunday seemed to indicate he did not support including the Mueller allegations in the impeachment articles.""In a charging decision -- and an impeachment in the House is essentially a charging decision -- to charge those that there's the strongest and most overwhelming evidence, and not try to charge everything even though you could charge other things,"" Schiff said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""""There is overwhelming evidence the President sought to coerce Ukraine into interfering in our election, essentially sought to cheat in our next election by getting a foreign government to weigh in,"" Schiff added. ""That is a very serious business and it imperils our national security, it's a gross abuse of his office and the President also deeply sought to obstruct the investigation into that wrongdoing, and I think that is the gravamen of this offense here.""The White House on Friday said it would not participate in the Judiciary Committee proceedings, telling the committee in a letter the impeachment inquiry was ""completely baseless"" and a ""reckless abuse of power.""Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Sunday that the committee was prepared to hold another hearing this week if the White House planned to present its own case, but because Trump isn't participating the committee does not expect another hearing.""We need to listen, we need to go through the hearing (Monday) and see what is said there,"" Jayapal said. ""We do want to listen to the minority case, the minority's counsel, we want to make sure we have all that information in front of us, and then once that's done, we'll have a good sense of what's next.""This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.CNN's Aishvarya Kavi contributed to this report."
Buttigieg releases descriptions of McKinsey projects in face of criticism,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/pete-buttigieg-mckinsey-projects/index.html," (CNN)Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Friday released a timeline of his three years working for the elite consulting firm McKinsey.The release comes after some of Buttigieg's presidential opponents called for him to be more transparent about his time at the firm as some of McKinsey's work for the federal government, including for Immigration and Customs Enforcement on projects along the US-Mexico border, drew increased scrutiny this month.Buttigieg detailed seven projects in the release. ""To the best of my recollection, these are all of my client engagements during my time with the firm, but a full release from McKinsey will allow the American public to see the full scope of my work,"" Buttigieg says in the statement.The release does not include a detailed list of his clients, something that he has been called to release but rejected -- for now -- because of a nondisclosure agreement he has with his former employer. But Buttigieg, as part of the Friday release, gave the consulting firm ""authorization ... to release the full list of clients I was assigned to serve.""Among his projects, Buttigieg lists a nonprofit health insurance provider in Michigan, a grocery and retail chain in Toronto, a consumer goods retail chain in Chicago, a project on energy efficiency and climate change in Connecticut and an environmental nonprofit in California.From 2008 to 2009, he worked on a project focused on combating climate change through energy efficiency -- the only project he lists his clients on. He partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Natural Resources Defense Council as part of a team that ultimately published a report titled ""Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the US Economy.""Per the campaign, Buttigieg served a nonprofit health insurance provider for three months, focusing on on-the-job training for savings in administration and overhead costs. In 2008, he worked in consumer goods -- focused on grocery pricing for a client in Toronto and helping a consumer goods store in Chicago investigating the market for energy-efficient home products -- before taking a leave of absence from the firm to work on a Democratic campaign for Indiana governor.Buttigieg spent part of 2009 working out of Washington with visits to Iraq and Afghanistan on a project ""focused on increasing employment and entrepreneurship in those countries' economies."" He would later return to Afghanistan as part of a deployment with the Navy Reserve in 2014.""Much of my work at McKinsey, including the names of clients served, is covered under a confidentiality agreement that I signed when I joined the firm,"" Buttigieg said, recalling how he and his campagn asked McKinsey to release him from the confidentiality agreement in September. ""To date, the company has not agreed.""The most recent call for Buttigieg to release his client list came this week, when The New York Times published an editorial calling on the presidential candidate to release his clients.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, also took the opportunity on Thursday to call for Buttigieg to disclose his clients, telling reporters in Boston, ""I think that voters want to know about possible conflicts of interests.""Buttigieg worked for the consulting firm from 2007 to 2010, shortly before he entered politics with a failed bid to be the Indiana treasurer and a successful bid to become the mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana.In his recent memoir, Buttigieg cast his time at McKinsey as a chance to get real world experience after graduating from Harvard and Oxford; the book spends the most time focused on a project to better understand grocery pricing.""Back to the US in 2007,"" the mayor wrote, ""I landed a job in Chicago at McKinsey & Company, and my classroom was everywhere -- a conference room, a serene corporate office, the break room of a retail store, a safe house in Iraq, or an airplane seat -- any place that could accommodate me and my laptop.""He added: ""The capstone on my decade of education was in 2010, when I left McKinsey for a tough but priceless year-long political crash course in which I challenged the state treasurer of Indiana and was overwhelmingly defeated in my first experience on the ballot.""But Friday's release includes more details that had been previously unknown.""I believe transparency is particularly important under the present circumstances in our country, which is one of the reasons why I have released all tax returns from my time in the private sector and since,"" Buttigieg said. ""I am today reiterating my request that McKinsey release me from this agreement. ... This company must recognize the importance of transparency in the exceptional case of a former employee becoming a competitive candidate for the U.S. presidency.""Buttigieg told CNN earlier this year that he had gone to McKinsey because he ""felt that I needed to get experience in business."" While he had studied economics, he had not ""done the work of being involved in how people and money and goods move around the world.""""I had an opportunity to work on those things at a place known for being very strong at it and for the kind of training that helps educate for that, and it felt like the missing piece of my education,"" he said. ""I wasn't sure consulting was going to be for me for the long term. But I knew that I could grow and do that, and I do think it's, it could be distinguishing relative to people have no business experience at a time where we got to demonstrate that you can be progressive, pro-labor and reasonably knowledgeable about business too."""
Democrats obtained phone records showing how Trump allies coordinated 'false narratives',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/intelligence-report-phone-records-devin-nunes/index.html," (CNN)Armed with never-before-seen phone records, Democrats on Tuesday accused President Donald Trump's allies of coordinating with a conservative journalist to peddle ""false narratives"" about Trump's opponents as part of his multi-pronged pressure campaign on Ukraine. The House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report -- which was made public Tuesday -- says the committee's top Repubican, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, was linked to that effort.The records, according to Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell, were subpoenaed from third-parties.""Mr. Solomon was not working alone,"" the report said of conservative journalist John Solomon's articles throughout 2019 that spread Trump-backed conspiracies about Ukraine. ""As further described below, there was a coordinated effort by associates of President Trump to push these false narratives publicly, as evidenced by public statements, phone records, and contractual agreements.""The phone records, which are labeled in the report's endnotes as coming from AT&T, show a web of communications between Solomon, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Ukrainian American businessman Lev Parnas, Nunes and the White House's budget office. CNN is owned by AT&T.""Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies. In all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law,"" said Jim Greer, a spokesman for AT&T.Many of these calls occurred in April, according to the Democratic report, the same time Solomon pumped out columns in The Hill. The stories were filled with discredited conspiracy theories about then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son was on the board of a prominent Ukrainian energy company. The Democratic report identifies at least four phone calls or attempted calls between Parnas and Nunes, including one call on April 12 that lasted longer than eight minutes. Within an hour of that call, Parnas also spoke with Giuliani, who later connected with Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow and a ""White House phone number,"" according to the phone records.The call logs show the extent the Democratic investigators went to get hands on any evidence it could get, even as the administration blocked access to records. The records were not discussed publicly before the release of the report.In addition, Parnas' lawyer has said his client, who pleaded not guilty in October to charges that he and Igor Fruman funneled foreign money to US campaign coffers, was willing to turn over some documents to the committee and has turned over some materials already.

"Trump claims Americans have to flush the toilet '10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once'",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/trump-americans-flushing-toilets-intl/index.html," (CNN)President Donald Trump on Friday had a lot to say about toilets, sinks and showers. The President claimed Americans are flushing their toilets ""10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once"" and argued that they are having difficulty with washing their hands in what appeared to be a tangent about low-flow sinks and toilets. ""We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on -- and in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water,"" the President said during a roundtable with small business leaders about deregulatory actions.""You turn on the faucet and you don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out,"" the President continued, lowering his voice as he spoke about the drips. ""People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once."" It wasn't entirely clear what he was talking about but it appeared to have to do with bathroom fixtures with low-flow appliances. He said the Environmental Protection Agency was looking into the issue on his suggestion. ""They end up using more water. So (the) EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion,"" Trump said, though he did not give details on what suggestions, if any, he made. Video of the President's comments has been viewed more than a million times online.Trump, speaking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House amid an impeachment inquiry, then turned his attention to Americans attempting to wash their hands. ""You go into a new building or a new house or a new home and they have standards only you don't get water. You can't wash your hands practically, there's so little water comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands,"" Trump said.He went on: ""There may be some areas where we'll go the other route -- desert areas -- but for the most part you have many states where they have so much water -- it comes down, it's called rain. They don't know what to do with it,"" to laughs from around the table. ""So we're going to be looking at opening up that I believe.  And we're looking at changing the standards very soon."" It is also unclear what standards Trump was referring to or how they could be changing. The EPA has a voluntary program that labels efficient fixtures, such as showerheads, called WaterSense -- similar to EnergyStar for water, which helps conservation. A 1992 law also regulated showerhead pressure, but it was implemented through the Energy Department, not the EPA. The EPA said it is reviewing relevant federal programs. ""EPA is working with all federal partners including Department of Energy to review the implementation of the Federal Energy Management Plan and how it's relevant programs interact with it to ensure American consumers have more choice when purchasing water products,"" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Energy Department for comment. Touting his administration's decision to change energy standards on lightbulbs, Trump also claimed energy-efficient bulbs don't ""make you look as good.""""Being a vain person, that's really important to me,"" he said. ""It gives you an orange look, I don't want an orange look."" The President has made similar comments before, and the Department of Energy has moved to rescind Obama-era rules on energy efficiency. And of new car models, Trump added: ""Frankly they don't work very well,"" because of standards which California put in place. ""Right now the cars are made out of papier-mache, and ours are actually, we allow steel content,"" he said. In the past, the President has crusaded against windmills and wind energy. He has claimed that they create ""bird graveyards"" and the noise they produce ""causes cancer."" "
'I'm insulted': Constitutional expert rejects suggestion she wasn't read up on impeachment proceedings,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/pamela-karlan-doug-collins-hearing/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)A constitutional law expert fiercely defended her knowledge of the impeachment inquiry Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee after the panel's top Republican suggested she wasn't read up on the proceedings.Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford University, was responding to Rep. Doug Collins, who said the four professors invited to speak about impeachment were ""in here today to testify on stuff most of you have already written about.""""Unless you're really good on TV or (have been) watching the hearings for the last couple weeks, you couldn't have possibly actually digested the Adam Schiff report from yesterday or the Republican response in any real way,"" Collins said, referring to the report released Tuesday by the House Intelligence Committee that claimed evidence of President Donald Trump's alleged misconduct and obstruction of Congress is ""overwhelming.""""Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts,"" Karlan said during the panel's first hearing in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump. ""I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts,"" she said, visibly frustrated by the Georgia Republican's remarks. Karlan, who had gone off script when she fired back at Collins, said during her opening statement that Trump invited foreign involvement in the upcoming election and that he ""must be held accountable"" in order to uphold the Constitution. ""Based on the evidentiary record before you, what has happened in the case before you is something that I do not think we have ever seen before: a President who has doubled down on violating his oath to faithfully execute the laws and to protect and defend the Constitution,"" she said. ""If we are to keep faith with our Constitution and our Republic, President Trump must be held to account."" "
Trump stresses Saudi Arabia response to Navy base attack as Florida Republicans take harsher tone,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/trump-saudi-pensacola-terrorist/index.html,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's support for Saudi Arabia in the wake of a deadly shooting by a Saudi national at a Florida naval base is underscoring the latitude Trump gives the Kingdom's rulers, even as Congress has pushed to limit the ties between Washington and Riyadh.The December 6 attack on a military base in the Florida panhandle -- a political stronghold for the President -- raises questions about whether Trump will feel any political fallout as Florida Republicans warn Saudi Arabia not to interfere in investigations and call for a review of foreigners training on US bases.Also in question: the extent to which Saudi Arabia will help with the investigation.The FBI is presuming the attack, which killed three US young servicemembers, was an act of terrorism, a word the President has yet to use, though he has tweeted about Saudi condolences and promises of cooperation.  Speaking at the White House the day after, Trump said Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud had told him they ""are devastated,"" and that the King would be involved ""in taking care of the families."" The President promised that ""we will get to the bottom"" of what happened.'Really remarkable'It's not the first time the President has come to Saudi Arabia's defense. His remarks echoed his approach after the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That premeditated murder was conducted by members of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's inner circle and US intelligence services have linked it to the prince himself. The Florida attack took place Friday when Mohammed Alshamrani, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force and a student naval flight officer, opened fire in a classroom building on the navy base. The 21-year-old, one of 852 Saudis in the US for Defense Department security cooperation training, was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him.In the aftermath, the manner and speed of Trump's reaction raised eyebrows. ""It is really remarkable how he has gone out of his way to defend the Saudis,"" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official who now directs the Brookings Intelligence Project. Riedel, who wrote a 2017 book on Saudi-US ties since the 1930s, said of the Kingdom's rulers that ""so far they haven't had to do anything because the President has been their spokesman.""Robert Jordan, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia who took up that post immediately after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, agreed. ""The immediate response of the President in talking about King Salman's condolences and expressing how heartbroken the Saudi people was was a little quick,"" Jordan said. ""Clearly there is a relationship between the two leaders that is something they are trying to protect.""The White House and State Department refused to comment on whether national security adviser Robert O'Brien or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had advised the President on how to deal with the fallout over the weekend. Trump has consistently touted Saudi purchases of US weapons systems, ranging from helicopters to machine guns, and his close ties to the Kingdom's rulers. But as the FBI announced Monday morning that the investigation remains fluid and Naval Air Station Pensacola shifted back to routine access, some Florida Republicans were making clear they had no interest in protecting the relationship. Florida Sen. Rick Scott repeated his calls Monday for the administration to suspend military training programs for ""foreign nationals on American soil"" pending a full review. The day after the shooting, stalwart Trump supporter Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida tweeted that he'd told the Saudi ambassador ""in the strongest possible terms that we expect to conduct our investigation w full cooperation & no interference from the Kingdom.""And in the tense hours after the attack on Friday afternoon, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said, ""There's obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi Air Force and then to be here training on our soil."" Democrats in Congress -- and some Republicans, such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham -- have long pushed for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable for the Khashoggi killing and repeated reports of human rights violations in Yemen, where Riyadh is fighting Iranian-backed militants.  'Latitude'In September, Trump vetoed bipartisan efforts to block ""emergency"" sales of weapons to the Kingdom.Some analysts don't think Friday's killing of US troops will change the President's impulse to protect Saudi Arabia. ""Yes the US-Saudi Arabia relationship is badly strained in Congress ... but I don't see this incident altering the margin for error and the latitude this administration continues to give to Saudi Arabia,"" said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Foundation.  A former White House official said Trump has clearly been getting bad advice on Saudi Arabia. This official said the President's initial statements should have emphasized a focus is on the families of those killed and the longstanding intelligence relationship Washington has with Riyadh. ""He probably focused on how badly the Saudis felt because that is the last thing he heard in the conversation,"" this former official said. ""And the President is aware that because of the Khashoggi incident everything that the US does with the Saudis is under the microscope."" That would drive his desire to make sure Americans know the Saudis ""came out with an outpouring of support on this."" The former official added that Trump ""is favorable towards the Saudis, but I can't say it is because of personal economic reasons or if it is because he is thinking we don't know anything right now and these guys are getting a ton of heat.""An inclination to 'do the minimum'Alshamrani's motive is still undetermined, but the FBI knows he purchased his gun legally and investigators want to know more about a trip he made back to Saudi Arabia earlier this year. On Sunday, the Saudi prince called Trump to reiterate the Kingdom's ""absolute cooperation"" with the US on the investigation, officials said. And on Monday, a high-ranking Saudi defense attaché was traveling to Pensacola to meet with US officials. But a person familiar with the case said tension between the countries is rising over the fact that up to a dozen remaining Saudi military students in Pensacola have had their movements restricted to the base. And experts say history indicates there won't likely be much real cooperation. ""The natural Saudi inclination will be to get any Saudi who could be linked up in this -- the classmates of this guy -- to get them out of the United States as quickly as possible and do the minimum -- provide rank and serial number,"" Riedel said. ""They tend to be very jealous about sharing information about Saudi citizens."" Referring to the terrorist attack on a Saudi housing complex where US and coalition forces were living in 1996, Riedel said, ""That's how they acted in the Khobar Towers, that's how they acted in 9/11 -- they were very reluctant to provide information.""""There is a tendency of denial,"" said Jordan, the former ambassador, of the Saudis. When Jordan first arrived in the country, King Salman, then the governor of Riyadh, insisted no Saudis were involved in the 9/11 attacks and that Israel was behind them. Fifteen out of the 19 attackers were Saudi.  ""I think the more recent history of the Khashoggi murder is further instruction on this,"" Jordan continued, alluding to the lack of cooperation surrounding the journalist's death. ""They are going to be very reluctant to air any dirty laundry with the US or the public... We need to find out what happened when this guy went home for vacations. That is going to be very difficult."" CNN's David Shortell, Maegan Vazquez, Nic Robertson, Julia Jones, Scott Glover, Whitney Wild, Shimon Prokupecz, Josh Campbell contributed to this report"
9 takeaways from the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/house-judiciary-committee-impeachment-hearing-moments-takeaways/index.html,"I watched the hearing and identified key moments and takeaways in real time. They're below.It was a looooong dayIt became clear within the first five minutes of the hearing that Republicans were committed to trying to gum up the works using a variety of parliamentary stall tactics. Within the first 90 minutes of the hearing, Republicans forced roll call votes of the 41 members on the committee three times -- once to try to force Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, to testify, once to postpone the hearings and a third time to force the so-called ""whistleblower"" to testify. While all those motions were voted down -- as will all such future motions offered by Republicans on Wednesday -- they had the desired slow-down effect nonetheless. These stall tactics by Republicans are a marked changed from the public impeachment hearings in the House Intelligence Committee, where there were very few similar attempts to disrupt the proceedings by the minority party. That change speaks to the cultural difference between the two committees. The Intelligence Committee is a small committee (20-ish members) with, typically, more workhorses than showhorses. The Judiciary Committee is almost twice as large in terms of members and packed with showhorses on both sides of the aisle seeking to score points for the cameras.All of which meant that Wednesday's hearing was going to be a circus. And a slow one at that.Jerry Nadler explains why impeachment needs to be considered nowIn his opening statement, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, sought to address the biggest question Democrats face when it comes to the ongoing impeachment process: Why now? Especially when Trump will be up for reelection in less than a year?""We are all aware that the next election is looming -- but we cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis,"" Nadler said. ""The integrity of that election is the very thing at stake. The President has shown us his pattern of conduct. If we do not act to hold him in check -- now -- President Trump will almost certainly try again to solicit interference in the election for his personal, political benefit.""In short: We can't wait because there is every reason to believe that Trump will do what he did with Ukraine again and again before the 2020 election. And such behavior would set a hugely dangerous precedent for how future presidents -- Democrat or Republican -- can and should act. Nadler's argument won't change the minds of his Republican colleagues in Congress. But they're not the intended audience. Voters around the country are.Republicans ignore facts, focus on the 'why' behind impeachment pushGeorgia Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, used his opening statement not to dispute the basic facts surrounding the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but rather to trace the origins of calls for the President to be impeached.""This is not an impeachment,"" Collins said. ""This is just a simple railroad job, and today's (hearing) is a waste of time. It didn't start with (Robert) Mueller, it didn't start with a phone call. It started with tears in Brooklyn in November 2016."" Which means, in the case you somehow missed it, a reference to Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.The goal here was simple: Make this hearing -- and the broader impeachment investigation -- focused on Democrats' hatred of Trump, not about what Trump did (or didn't do).One witness smacks down Doug Collins -- biglyIn Collins' opening statement, he repeatedly took a dismissive tone toward the quartet of law professors sitting before him. ""We got law professors here,"" he joked at the end of his opening statement. ""What a start of a party."" One of the four -- Stanford Law professor Pam Karlan -- took considerable umbrage at Collins' dismissals.""Everything I know about our Constitution and its values and my review of the evidentiary record -- and here Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts, so I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts,"" Karlan scolded the Georgia Republican.Collins looked as though he wanted to say something, but didn't interrupt Karlan.Jonathan Turley is a very good witness for RepublicansTurley, a law professor at George Washington University, is the lone GOP witness among the four professors. What has made him effective in the hearing, however, is his calm and reasoned appeals to rise above the current partisanship of the moment. Turley made clear in his opening statement that he didn't vote for Trump, and he didn't believe that Trump's call with Zelensky was ""perfect,"" as Trump has said. He also admitted to being frustrated at the current situation in Washington.Those admissions made his insistence stronger that there wasn't enough evidence yet to impeach Trump and that the whole process would be better if everyone slowed down, took a deep breath and thought of the ramifications of their actions. Turley turned out to be everything (and more) Republicans had hoped.What a day for history nerds!Do you love obscure references to American history and our founding fathers? Boy, have we got the hearing for you! In the morning session alone, we got MULTIPLE references to William Davie, the 18th Century governor of North Carolina. We got a reference to Viscount John Mordaunt, who was impeached by the British House of Commons in 1666 but quickly pardoned by King Charles II. At one point, one of the witnesses -- Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman -- postulated that the committee needed to consider what they would say about their rulings if they met James Madison or Alexander Hamilton in the afterlife. So that's what law professors' fan fiction looks like!Here's the quote of the hearing for DemocratsWhile Karlan was the shining star of the day for Democrats, it was University of North Carolina Law School professor Michael Gerhardt who offered up what I believe will be the most regularly quoted line of the day. ""If what we're talking about isn't impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" said Gerhardt, referencing what he believed to be the clear impeachable conduct of bribery and obstruction detailed in the report released Tuesday by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.Nadler's own words come back to haunt himNadler was a prominent defender of Bill Clinton during the late 1990s when House Republicans impeached the former President for lying under oath about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. At the time, Nadler argued that impeachment should never be pursued if only one party favored it because it would deeply divide the nation.Ohio Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, in one of the best moments for the GOP in the hearing, reminded Nadler of how much a difference a few decades make. Chabot read a series of Nadler quotes from the late 1990s, noting that he agreed with that version of Nadler and wondering what -- other than the President's party -- had changed.Nadler chose not to respond.The ""Barron"" vs. ""baron"" controversyAs the afternoon session began, Karlan was asked by one of the Democratic committee members to elucidate the differences between a king and a president -- as a way to more broadly explain why the founding fathers included the impeachment clause in the Constitution.She responded this way: ""The Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. So while the President can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron.""First lady Melania Trump took offense to the reference to her teenage son. ""A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics,"" she tweeted. ""Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it."" Later, Karlan apologized. ""I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the President's son,"" she said. ""It was wrong of me to do that. I wish the President would apologize, for the things he's done that's wrong, but I do regret having said that.""Republicans have already seized on Karlan's comment. Vice President Mike Pence called it a ""new low"" in the impeachment hearings."
Trump publicly minimizes impeachment while he stews privately,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/politics/donald-trump-impeachment-history-legacy/index.html,"It's not the history-making Trump prefers. While he's been quick to downplay the moment as the culmination of a partisan witch hunt led by angry Democrats, people familiar with his mindset say he's taken a somber view in private as his impeachment looms.No president wants to be impeached and Trump is no different, despite the political upside his advisers insist will come when voters cast ballots next year. Long strings of early morning tweets and retweets have only amplified the sense that Trump is agitated as the fateful vote nears.During a campaign rally on Tuesday night, Trump dismissed the impeachment inquiry against him as ""flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous,"" telling the Pennsylvania crowd it was just a bunch of ""impeachment crap.""""This is the lightest, weakest impeachment,"" Trump said. ""You know our country's had, actually, many impeachments. You'd call judges and lot of, many impeachments, but it was on today everybody said this is impeachment-lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country, by far. It's not even like an impeachment.""But while the President is minimizing the articles of impeachment leveled against him, several sources say that privately his stance remains the same.""I think he's been preparing for this for some time,"" a Trump adviser said, adding the President has appeared somewhat taken aback that his actions toward Ukraine are ultimately what led to his likely impeachment.  ""Frankly, I think he's a little surprised it's the Ukraine thing that's done it,"" the adviser said.Trump still views impeachment through a serious lens. He does not want to be part of a notorious group of presidents who have been impeached, a bracket that includes Bill Clinton, whose own impeachment Trump has brought up repeatedly and critically in the past, saying it's what people remember most about Clinton's time in office. Trump has said he does not want his own legacy to face a similar fate. Clinton himself -- the only living president to have been impeached, though he was acquitted by the Senate -- has publicly counseled Trump to continue going about his job without becoming consumed with the proceedings, as he attempted to do during his own impeachment inquiry. It's advice Trump has ignored. ""Congress is doing what they believe is right,"" Clinton said while leaving an event in New York City on Tuesday. ""The rest of us should go about our lives, and all of us commenting on it won't have anything to do with it. They should do their job, I'll do mine.""Even developments Trump would ordinarily relish have left him with a sour taste. He's suggested that legacy items, such as a renegotiated North American trade agreement, are wrapped up in the impeachment mire.""Without the impeachment, they would have never approved it, in my opinion,"" Trump said of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which Democrats announced Tuesday they were ready to support after extensive negotiations with the administration. Passage of the NAFTA replacement would amount to one of his top legislative achievements.""The impeachment is the reason they approved it and interestingly one hour after the news conference, they went out and did a news conference on the big trade deal,"" he said, shrugging as he departed the White House under a black umbrella for his campaign rally.Trump regularly peppers aides over how impeachment is polling. While some of those aides have tried to argue the potential political benefits of impeachment, Trump has still privately griped about going through it.And like during other moments of crisis, Trump is fixated on how the news media is portraying him.""The coverage bugs him,"" a Trump campaign adviser said. A president facing impeachment being in a cloudy mood is hardly a revelation. For Trump, the prospect has been looming for nearly as long as he's been president, as Democrats publicly floated the idea -- a fact Trump's allies now argue is evidence of a rigged-from-the-start mindset.When it became clear a year ago that Democrats were likely to take control of the House of Representatives, the odds for impeachment increased and with them, Trump's worries.And as the Ukraine scandal rapidly unspooled during Trump's visit to New York in September for the yearly United Nations meetings -- eventually prompting the formal impeachment inquiry -- the President appeared distracted and unfocused during conversations, according to advisers.Aides say there's little expectation of a reset once the House holds its impeachment vote, which could occur as soon as next week following a vote in the Judiciary Committee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't begin a Senate trial until the new year, despite Trump's publicly stated desire to get the proceedings over with.The two men are at odds over how the trial might look. In conversations with the White House, the Kentucky Republican has made clear he hopes to end the trial as soon as he can, an effort to both get impeachment off his lap and protect his conference from potentially damaging votes should the process break out into partisan warfare.But Trump has made clear to his advisers that rather than end the trial quickly, he is hoping for a dramatic event, according to two people familiar with his thinking -- complete with high-profile witnesses testifying live on Capitol Hill.For now, there is expected to be a public lull over the Christmas holidays between the House vote and -- if he's impeached -- the Senate trial.In private, however, aides aren't expecting a restful break. Trump is planning to spend more than two weeks at his Florida resort plotting his Senate defense."
Takeaways from the inspector general's report into the FBI's Russia investigation,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/takeaways-doj-ig-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department's inspector general took a big swing at the conspiracy theories peddled by President Donald Trump and others about the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.But the IG's much anticipated report released Monday also detailed errors the FBI committed during the investigation, specifically about surveillance warrants issued for a former Trump campaign aide.Here are the key takeaways:Legal and unbiased origin of the probeIn no uncertain words, the inspector general says there was no political conspiracy to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign. Horowitz did not find ""documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions"" to launch the investigation. The report accuses a former FBI lawyer of altering a document related to the surveillance of campaign aide Carter Page. But Horowitz did not find that it undermined the overall validity of the surveillance.Conspiracy theories debunkedThe report essentially rebuts more than two years of talking points by Trump and Republicans about a deep-state effort to derail his campaign. There were no FBI spies planted in Trump Tower, for instance. And the famed dossier by ex-British spy Christopher Steele was not the reason the investigation was launched, the IG report states.Horowitz specifically says that Peter Strzok, a former senior counterintelligence officer, and Lisa Page, a former FBI attorney, whom Trump has repeatedly vilified and mocked in crude ways, did not act out of bias or unduly influence the start of the investigation.The IG's office found that the FBI did not try to recruit members of the Trump campaign as informants, and did not to try infiltrate the campaign itself -- either by instructing sources to get hired onto the campaign, or by sending sources into campaign spaces to collect information.Horowitz will be pressed to explain his conclusions Wednesday before an unfriendly audience: Trump ally Lindsey Graham's Senate Judiciary Committee. Serious mistakes by the FBIWhile the report doesn't back up conspiracy theories promoted by Trump and his allies, the inspector general details 17 ""significant inaccuracies and omissions"" in four applications for surveillance targeting Page.A low-level FBI lawyer -- now under investigation but unnamed in the report-- doctored an email that he sent to a supervisory FBI agent as they tried to determine whether they needed to inform a special court overseeing surveillance warrants that Page had been a US government source in the past.The information was not included in the surveillance warrant applications, but it could have been exculpatory because some of Page's past contacts with Russians were approved by the US government, the IG report said.The inspector general also found highly partisan instant messages, insulting Trump and calling Vice President Mike Pence ""stupid,"" sent by the low-level FBI lawyer. After the election, the FBI lawyer said in a message: ""Viva le resistance."" While it's unclear how significant a role the altered document played in the FBI's investigation of Page, Horowitz did not find that it undermined the overall validity of the surveillance.The FBI and Justice Department also misstated a key piece of information about Steele in the FISA applications, the IG found, saying that while Steele had previously provided information to the FBI that helped further criminal investigations, his reporting had never been used in a criminal proceeding.In unusual move, Barr and Durham go on the attackAttorney General William Barr and John Durham, the US attorney leading a separate review for Barr, are unhappy with the IG's conclusions about a lack of political bias. In an unusual set of public statements Monday, Barr and Durham said the FBI investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia was flawed from the start. ""The inspector general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a US presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions, that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,"" Barr said in a statement. ""It is also clear that, from its inception the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.""Durham emphasized that he's doing a more extensive investigation into the FBI's Russia probe, promising there's more to come from the top levels of the Justice Department.""Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the US and outside of the US,"" Durham said.CNN's David Shortell, Marshall Cohen, Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez contributed to this report."
National Security Agency inspector general says some data not being deleted quickly enough,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/nsa-data-inspector-general/index.html,"The summary released Thursday by the NSA's Office of the Inspector General is based on a classified report produced earlier this year and says that ""a small percentage of the large number"" of pieces of content the NSA collects is ""being retained beyond legal and policy limits."" It does not specify the actual number.""Current oversight must be strengthened if it is to ensure compliance with retention requirements,"" the summary found.'Perfect compliance'The NSA is required to periodically delete much of the information it collects, either after a set expiration date — often five years — or because it is information the agency isn't allowed to hold on to, for example, if an operation inadvertently picks up on a conversation between two American citizens. The report looks at signals intelligence, such as phone calls and online communication, that the NSA collects using two of its primary legal authorities for foreign intelligence, Executive Order 12333 and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.To address these problems, the OIG made 11 recommendations to the NSA in its original report. The NSA has already addressed four of those recommendations and is in the process of addressing the remaining seven, the OIG said.""As is the case with any complex data management process that relies on computers and software programs, some error rate is possible,"" an NSA spokesman said in a statement. ""The agency's goal is for perfect compliance."""
Analysis: America still doesn't know how to talk about Kamala Harris,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/kamala-harris-race-history/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Kamala Harris' campaign wasn't perfect -- but the context of her candidacy shouldn't be ignored, either.The California Democrat, who on Tuesday bowed out of the 2020 bid for the White House, struggled to maintain a coherent vision on the campaign trail; internal turmoil also permeated her camp. But scrutiny of just these mistakes glosses over the specific histories that have shaped the woman who was the only black female candidate in the race and the uneven standards that had a hand in knocking her out of it.While Barack Obama succeeded in getting elected as America's first black president and Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a major party's presidential nomination, it's obvious that both black Americans and women are underrepresented in US politics (and board rooms and other upper echelons of power). It's not just a coincidence -- there are very real biases that work against minorities and women.These biases and cultural complexities mean that a record of achievement that could lift a white man's candidacy -- a career as a strong law-enforcement officer -- could pull down a black woman's.Harris' most obvious demerit was her career as a prosecutor, first as San Francisco's district attorney and then as the state's attorney general. The narrative became, simply: Kamala's a cop.And yet, black Americans' relationship with the criminal justice system can't be captured so easily. As The Atlantic's Peter Beinart explains: ""What (Harris' critics) didn't do nearly enough was ask whether Harris, as a black woman, could have adopted non-punitive crime policies 10 or 15 years ago and become a city district attorney and state attorney general in the first place,"" given that ""perceived softness on crime was particularly perilous for black politicians.""This bind stretches back even further. In his 2017 book ""Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,"" the Yale Law School professor and former public defender James Forman Jr. chronicles not only the fact that black politicians in the 1970s embraced tough-on-crime policies but also why.""(Black leaders) want more police, more prisons, better jobs, better schools, better parks. They want the whole thing, all of the above. Instead, they get one of the above, which is law enforcement,"" Forman told NPR, describing the ""pressure-cooker environment"" that existed in the years before anyone could fathom the singular damage America's drug war would inflict on black communities.This isn't to excuse the flawed decisions Harris has made in the past, especially those, such as her advocacy for anti-truancy laws (which she has apologized for), that wrought disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Neither is it to suggest that she shouldn't have faced hard scrutiny in, of all environments, a presidential contest.Rather, it's to underscore that context is key. A better understanding of the political foundation that's influenced Harris offers valuable insight into the dueling interests she had to navigate as a top-tier Democratic candidate; and that's to say nothing of the pernicious alchemy of racism and sexism she contended with compared with some of her rivals. (""Success within the system was still a laudable act of subversiveness -- whether as an investment banker, a corporate lawyer or a district attorney,"" The Washington Post's Robin Givhan recently wrote of Harris' time as an undergraduate at Howard University.)And: The Democratic pool, once lauded for its unprecedented diversity, is now all the worse with Harris out of the running so early. As my CNN colleague MJ Lee tweeted on Tuesday: ""Kamala Harris' campaign was historic -- a black and South Asian female candidate whose potential seemed sky high early on,"" she wrote. ""Her dropping out means that every candidate that's qualified so far for the next debate is white: Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Sanders, Steyer and Warren.""Or as the journalist Mythili Sampathkumar put it: ""Personal political disagreements aside: it was/is profound to have seen a Tamil girl be so comfortable in all her cultures and run for president.""Looking ahead, perhaps the more meaningful thing to do isn't to enumerate Harris' missteps; it's to remember that this country still isn't prepared to talk honestly about certain black experiences."
Michael Bloomberg releases letter from doctor that says he is in 'outstanding health',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/michael-bloomberg-health-letter/index.html,"The Democratic candidate underwent a coronary stent placement in 2000 for a blocked artery, according to the letter, signed by Dr. Stephen D. Sisson, a professor of medicine with Johns Hopkins University.  Bloomberg has had annual cardiac stress testing since the stent placement, and his 2019 test was ""normal and demonstrated excellent exercise tolerance,"" the letter says. The former mayor is on a blood thinner after developing atrial fibrillation in the setting of otherwise normal heart function in 2018, according to the letter. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat. It can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. According to the American Heart Association, at least 2.7 million Americans are living with atrial fibrillation, and the most common treatment is medication.The letter notes Bloomberg takes blood thinners, beta-blockers and cholesterol medication, but does not note specific medications or dosages. All these medications are commonly prescribed to manage heart conditions and cholesterol.""Mr. Bloomberg is a 77-year-old man in outstanding health. There are no medical concerns, present or looming, that would prevent him from serving as President of the United States,"" the letter reads. Bloomberg is 5 feet 7 inches tall and 165 pounds with ""a muscular body mass index of 25.8kg/m2,"" according to the letter. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. BMI is determined by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.Bloomberg doesn't smoke and does not have a history of substance use disorder or unhealthy alcohol use, the letter says. ""His diet and health habits are excellent,"" the letter reads. The campaign's letter summarized Bloomberg's health, though it did not include medical records. Last week, Elizabeth Warren's campaign released its own letter, along with results of the senator's most recent annual physical exam.Bloomberg announced a late-entry presidential bid last month aimed squarely at defeating President Donald Trump. His pitch to voters is that Trump is more likely to get reelected if Bloomberg doesn't run, suggesting none of the other Democratic contenders can beat Trump. "
Independent lawmaker says he's ready to vote to impeach Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/justin-amash-supports-impeachment/index.html," (CNN)Rep. Justin Amash said Friday that he is prepared to vote for three articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, ensuring that Democrats won't be the only ones to impeach the President when the historic vote hits the floor as soon as this month.Amash, a Michigan independent who left the Republican Party this summer after he backed formal impeachment proceedings, told CNN on Friday he would back three articles of impeachment: obstruction of Congress, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. He cautioned though he would wait to see the final language before ultimately committing to vote for them.""I think there's sufficient evidence for all three,"" Amash said Friday on his way to the House floor. ""Impeachment is like an indictment. We're just issuing the charges. The trial happens in the Senate. There's certainly probable cause to issue charges.""So far, no House Republicans have signaled they'd vote to impeach Trump. One Republican who had kept the option open, Francis Rooney of Florida, told CNN that he's concerned there's been ""a rush to judgment"" by Democrats, criticizing them for not going to court to seek testimony from first-hand witnesses who've been blocked by the White House.And at least two Democrats, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota, are expected to vote against the articles, with Van Drew telling CNN that he's worried impeachment is ""tearing the country apart.""House Democrats have yet to finalize the articles of impeachment, but they are expected to be released next week.Amash was previously the only congressional Republican to fiercely criticize Trump and call for impeachment proceedings based on the actions outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Earlier this year, after months of criticism from his colleagues and the President, Amash left the GOP.""Today, I am declaring my independence and leaving the Republican Party,"" Amash said in his announcement in a Washington Post op-ed in July. ""No matter your circumstance, I'm asking you to join me in rejecting the partisan loyalties and rhetoric that divide and dehumanize us."""
The Point: Donald Trump's grand Russia conspiracy just fell apart,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/donald-trump-inspector-general-russia/index.html,"On Monday, a report from the Office of the Inspector General at the Justice Department made clear that is not at all what happened.Among the conclusions of Inspector General Michael Horowitz in the report:*There was no ""documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced"" the decision to open the counter-intelligence probe into possible Russian meddling known as ""Crossfire Hurricane.""* ""Crossfire Hurricane"" was begun solely because of information provided to the State Department by a ""Friendly Foreign Government."" (We know that ""FFG"" was Australia, which reported conversations between George Papadopoulos and an Australian diplomat in Britain in which Papadopoulos said he knew the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton.) That directly disputes assertions by Trump -- and lots and lots of Republicans -- that the reason the counter-intelligence probe was begun was because of information in the non-verified Steele dossier, a document compiled by a former British spy that was funded in part by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.* Neither Lisa Page nor Peter Strzok, ex-FBI officials who sent a series of anti-Trump texts to one another, played a determinative role in operation ""Crossfire Hurricane."" Of Page, Horowitz wrote: ""While Lisa Page attended some of the discussions regarding the opening of the investigations, she did not play a role in the decision to open Crossfire Hurricane or the four individual cases."" Of Strzok, Horowitz concluded: ""We further found that while Strzok was directly involved in the decisions to open Crossfire Hurricane and the four individual cases, he was not the sole, or even the highest-level, decision maker as to any of those matters."" That finding runs directly counter to Trump's repeated insistence that the ""lovers"" Strzok and Page -- the two were engaged in an extramarital affair during the 2016 election -- were somehow actively shaping the counter-intelligence operation to target him and keep him from office.That sound you just heard is the air coming out of the Trump conspiracy balloon. (You can and should read the full IG report yourself here.)Let's be clear here: Trump said that a series of ""deep state"" actors embedded within the Justice Department opened a counterintelligence operation based on a dossier paid for by his political opponents and was propped up throughout the election by people who were out to get him. According to the Justice Department Inspector General, none of that is true. Let me repeat: None of that is true.Clearly aware of the damage the IG report would do to Trump's now-debunked argument about the origins of ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" Attorney General William Barr quickly released a statement disputing the findings of his own department's inspector general. ""The Inspector General's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,"" said Barr.And it is true that the IG report noted that there were a number of errors in the way in which the FISA applications were made to wiretap former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page beginning in the fall of 2016. But there is no evidence in the Horowitz report suggesting that these errors were made purposely or with some broader attempt at coordination by Trump's so-called ""deep state"" enemies.Because we live in an era of hyper-partisanship in which facts and findings are somehow subject to whether you support President Trump or not, the IG report will likely change very little. Trump -- as signaled by the Barr statement -- will insist that the wrongdoings in the FISA applications surrounding Page are the REAL story here.""The IG report just came out and I was just briefed on it and it's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Trump said in response to the IG report on Monday afternoon. ""It should never again happen to another president. It is incredible, far worse than I would've ever thought possible and it's an embarrassment to our country, it's dishonest, it's everything that a lot of people thought it would be, except far worse.""But let's not confuse the issue: The President of the United States has said publicly -- and repeatedly -- that he was the victim of a ""deep state"" conspiracy aimed at keeping him out of office and hamstringing him while in office. A detailed report by an independent official within his own administration just made clear that's not true."
Michelle Obama calls impeachment proceedings into Trump 'surreal',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/michelle-obama-impeachment/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Former first lady Michelle Obama called the impeachment proceedings into President Donald Trump and Ukraine ""surreal"" as the House's inquiry heads into the homestretch. ""It's surreal. I don't think people know what to make of it. But do I think we can come back from it? Oh yeah,"" she said in an excerpt of an interview with NBC's ""Today Show"" published Monday.She continued: ""We've seen tough times in this country. You know we've gone through depressions and wars and bombings and terrorist attacks, and we've gone through Jim Crow, and we've always come out stronger. And that's what we have to continue to believe because what's our choice? To ball up in a corner and call it a day? Well that's not fair to this next generation that's coming before us that are counting on us to get this right.""Her remarks come ahead of the House Judiciary Committee's hearing on Monday where lawyers for the committee and the House Intelligence Committee will make opening arguments and present evidence from the impeachment inquiry before facing questions from the Judiciary panel. The hearing sets the stage for a two-week stretch, in which Democrats are expected to introduce impeachment articles, debate and approve them in the Judiciary Committee and then take a vote on the House floor that could make Trump the third President in US history to be impeached."
Trump still uses his personal cell phone despite warnings and increased call scrutiny,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/donald-trump-secure-phone-calls-impeachment/index.html,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has continued to use his personal cell phone to make calls, despite repeated warnings from his staff that the practice could leave him vulnerable to foreign surveillance, multiple officials told CNN.The Democratic impeachment inquiry has resurrected concerns about the security and potential vulnerability of the President's communications. Witness testimony revealed some top officials repeatedly failed to follow protocol intended to prevent sensitive phone conversations, including those involving the President, from being intercepted by foreign intelligence services. Several former US officials have told CNN it is highly likely that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's cell phone call to Trump from a restaurant in Ukraine over the summer was picked up by intelligence agencies from numerous foreign countries, including Russia.Normally, a US ambassador talking to the President would do so from the embassy using a secure line, one former intelligence official told CNN. Cell phones, the former official said, were much more vulnerable than calls made at secure communications facilities. The lapse was only amplified by the fact that Sondland made the call in public, where it could have been easily overheard and in a foreign country that is already being targeted by foreign adversaries of the US, including Russia, current and former officials said.And the House Intelligence Committee's recently released impeachment report includes phone records, which show a web of communications between conservative journalist John Solomon, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Ukrainian American businessman Lev Parnas, the intelligence committee's top Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes, and the White House's budget office.Congress' ability to subpoena Giuliani's call logs from cell phone companies suggests that the calls were not encrypted through an application service like Signal or Whatsapp, nor were the calls were made on a secure line.It's unlikely that Giuliani's mobile phone was specially encrypted, and the logs indicate that the calls were not made via a secure line from an embassy. Even if the President was using a secured cell phone to call the former New York mayor, Giuliani's unsecured line exacerbates security concerns. ""All communications devices of all senior government officials are targeted by foreign governments. This is not new,"" Bryan Cunningham, executive director of the Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute at the University of California-Irvine, told CNN last year.""What is new in the cell phone age is the ease of intercepting them,"" Cunningham added. ""Of course, calls are only secure if both parties use a secure device.""The phone records do not identify Trump by name, but House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff connected an ""unidentified"" number designated simply as ""-1"" in the logs to the President. But several members on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN that they did not know whether the numbers were traced to various individuals or who ""-1"" was.Since taking office, Trump has been cautioned against unsecured lines multiple times. But he has continued to call people on a number he held since before his time in the White House, including making calls from that number in the last several weeks, people familiar with those calls say. He also has a second number he uses, which is government-issued.On Friday evening, the President denied CNN's report, saying he hasn't used his personal cellphone in years. ""I haven't had a personal cell phone for years. Only use government approved and issued phones,"" Trump tweeted. CNN stands by its reporting.These are cell phones Trump has personally been issued. They are considered to be less secure than landline White House phones presidents typically use, and he has been cautioned against using them to make secure calls, sources tell CNN.CNN previously reported that Trump has given his personal number to foreign leaders on multiple occasions, outright ignoring security protocols. According to The Washington Post, Trump handing out his personal line led to one-on-one calls that even top White House aides did not know about. The New York Times reported last year that Chinese and Russian spies have listened in on Trump's calls on his personal cell phone and the President's aides have told him that Russian spies were listening in on a regular basis. Senior officials view moving Trump away from unsecure lines as a lost cause at this point, one person said. For a brief period earlier in his term, Trump agreed to stop using his personal device, but quit after he realized all of his calls could then be monitored on a call log list. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly had staff monitor the list routinely while he was still at the White House.UPDATE: This story has been updated with more information about the cell phones the President uses.CNN's  Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.

Cory Booker sees surge in campaign donations after calling out lack of diversity in 2020 Democratic field,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/cory-booker-fundraising-surge/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Since Sen. Cory Booker issued a call this week for maintaining a diverse field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, grassroots donors have answered in a big way. The New Jersey Democrat raised more than $1 million dollars between Tuesday -- when Sen. Kamala Harris of California dropped out of the race -- through Friday, his campaign said. His campaign added that Wednesday was his best online fundraising day of the entire campaign.That money came not only from Booker loyalists, but from many new supporters. Of 33,000 donors who contributed to the campaign since Tuesday, more than 50%, or roughly 17,000 donors, gave to Booker for the first time. The average contribution was $25, according to the campaign. The surge of fundraising for Booker suggests an enthusiastic, positive response to his searing criticism of a race to the White House that now has ""more billionaires than Black people."" On Thursday, Booker kicked off an Iowa swing with a speech highlighting the issue, warning: ""This is not about one candidate. It is about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump.""Booker's push for a diverse field comes as Democrats appear poised to hold the first debate of the cycle with all white candidates on stage. In November, Booker's campaign announced he reached the donor threshold for the December presidential debate. Despite the new interest in Booker from Democratic donors, it is likely too late for him to qualify for a spot: both Booker and Julián Castro, who has also pressed the need for minority candidates following Harris' departure, have yet to net a single qualifying poll for the December debate.It would be the first time Booker has not qualified for a debate this cycle. But he suggested this week that Harris' decision to end her campaign has lit a fire under him to press ahead in his own campaign.""I'm feeling even more determined,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday with BuzzFeed News' AM to DM. ""Because I know we need to resurrect that Obama coalition."" "
House Democrats vote to send impeachment report to Judiciary Committee,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/house-intelligence-committee-report/index.html," (CNN)The House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines Tuesday night to approve a report that found evidence of President Donald Trump's misconduct and obstruction of Congress is ""overwhelming.""The report, released earlier Tuesday, will form the backbone of the impeachment proceedings against the President and charges that Trump's conduct toward Ukraine compromised national securityThe vote will send the report to the House Judiciary Committee as that panel considers moving forward on articles of impeachment.The 300-page report from the House Intelligence Committee sets the stage for the impeachment of a US president for just the third time in history. The report stops short of outright recommending impeachment, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and the other committee chairs leading the inquiry said that was a decision Congress ultimately has to make.But the report makes clear that's where Democrats are heading.""I'm going to reserve any kind of a public judgment on that until I have a chance to consult with my colleagues, with our leadership,"" Schiff, a California Democrat, said when asked if there was evidence for impeachment. ""As you can tell, I am gravely concerned that if we merely accept this that we invite not only further corruption of our elections by this President, but we also invite it of the next president.""The report release kicks off what's poised to be a frenzied month in the House, with Democrats on track to potentially vote on impeaching Trump by Christmas. After Tuesday's vote, the impeachment proceedings shift to the Judiciary Committee, which will hold hearings beginning Wednesday and would draft articles of impeachment against Trump. Republican amendments to the Intelligence Committee report were rejected along party lines.The report is broken down into two sections, one on Ukraine and the other on obstruction of Congress — both of which are expected to be separate articles of impeachment.Democrats alleged that the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden — was the ""dramatic crescendo"" of a months-long campaign driven by the President that involved a number of senior officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.""The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage,"" the report says. ""In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the US presidential election process, and endangered US national security.""Democrats charged that the White House's obstruction of their impeachment investigation was an ""unprecedented campaign,"" detailing the numerous subpoenas that were defied over the two-month investigation.""Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the President since the inquiry began,"" the report says.Schiff said that the report does not answer every question Democrats have investigated, in part, he argued, because of the White House stonewalling. But he argued there was a ""grave risk to the country with waiting until we have every last fact, when we already know enough about the President's misconduct to make a responsible judgment about whether we think that's compatible with the office of the President.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Tuesday evening that she had not yet made a decision on impeachment, saying she's waiting to see the hearings in Judiciary starting Wednesday and that she would look at the report more closely because she just arrived back in the US after a congressional trip.""No, we haven't made it,"" Pelosi said.Pelosi told Democrats privately Tuesday evening that she would confer with the chairs of her relevant committees before next steps are decided, according to multiple sources. She would not commit to any timeline even as Democrats expect the President to be impeached by Christmas.The White House and congressional Republicans have rejected the Democratic allegations and dismissed the Democratic report on Tuesday. Congressional Republicans released their report ahead of the Democrats on Monday, a document that fully defended the President's actions on Ukraine and accused Democrats of rushing to impeach the President without any evidence that Trump did anything wrong.""At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. ""This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff's report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.""Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Schiff for planning to send his counsel, Daniel Goldman, to present the report before the committee. ""You have the gavel. You have the report. Come testify,"" Collins said.Democrats subpoenaed phone recordsThe Democratic report is based largely on the 17 witness interviews that were conducted over a two-month investigation that was sparked by an anonymous whistleblower complaint alleging Trump solicited foreign help with his 2020 reelection campaign.The main outlines of the story have been well documented in the two weeks of public testimony with 12 witnesses, in which multiple officials detailed an effort spearheaded by the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to oust then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and then push Kiev to announce investigations into the President's political rivals.But there are nuggets in the report that were previously unknown -- most notably a batch of phone logs that Democrats say were obtained by subpoenaing third-party phone records.The Democrats' narrative begins with Trump recalling Yovanovitch in April. This wasn't a one-off incident, the report argues, but rather a step Trump took so he could install his own appointees to subvert US policy on Ukraine. Democrats accused Trump's allies of coordinating with conservative journalist John Solomon to peddle ""false narratives"" about Yovanovitch as part of his multi-pronged pressure campaign. The House Intelligence Committee report says Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the panel, was linked to this scheme, based on the phone records they obtained.The call logs also spur new questions, such as why Giuliani made several phone calls to the Office of Management and Budget and the White House in April, as the campaign against Yovanovitch was in full swing.The report did not explicitly say how Democrats obtained these call logs, which are labeled as coming from AT&T, which owns CNN, and Verizon document productions. But Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who sits on the committee, told CNN on Tuesday that the panel ""subpoenaed outside third-party phone records.""  ""Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies. In all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law,"" said Jim Greer, a spokesman for AT&T.Asked about Nunes' involvement, Schiff said: ""There's a lot more to learn about that and I don't want to state that that is an unequivocal fact, but the allegations are deeply concerning.""A Nunes spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that he had ""no concerns"" with Nunes' conversations. ""I don't have a problem with Devin talking to individuals,"" McCarthy told reporters.Democrats say top officials part of Ukraine effortThe report charges that the Ukraine pressure campaign extended far beyond Trump and Giuliani into the administration, singling out a number of senior administration officials — including the vice president — of having knowledge of or participating in the effort.US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that he told Pence during a trip to Warsaw in early September that the withholding of military aid had ""become tied to the issue of investigations."" Democrats accused Pence of crafting a ""carefully worded statement"" during Sondland's testimony, arguing that the statement did not address the actual claims Sondland made.""Ambassador Sondland did not testify that he specifically mentioned the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine during his discussion with Vice President Pence, nor did he testify that he was alone with the Vice President,"" the report says.Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, responded that ""Adam Schiff is a proven liar and this allegation further solidifies that well-earned reputation.""Democrats argue that Pompeo, who listened into the July 25 call with Zelensky, was fully aware of Sondland's efforts to ""break the logjam"" of military aid to Ukraine and that it was conditioned on Zelensky announcing his intent to move forward with investigations.Questions still unansweredThe release of the report kicks the impeachment proceedings into the Judiciary Committee, which will have its first hearing Wednesday and is expected to draft and consider articles of impeachment in the coming days.But the Intelligence Committee said that its investigation is still ongoing, Schiff said, as impeachment investigators were unable to answer some key questions due to the Trump administration's refusal to participate in the impeachment inquiry.For instance, the Intelligence Committee was unable to determine if the resignation of former national security adviser John Bolton -- on September 10, amid the first reports of a whistleblower complaint -- was related to the Ukraine matter, because Bolton and his top deputy, Charles Kupperman, refused to testify for lawmakers, the report says. The report also relies on the reporting of The New York Times to explain why Trump first learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint, which the paper said came in a briefing with the White House counsel and a National Security Council lawyer in late August. It also remains unclear why Trump lifted the hold on the military aid to Ukraine.""Just like there was no official explanation for why the hold on Ukraine security assistance was implemented, numerous witnesses testified that they were not provided with a reason for why the hold was lifted on September 11,"" the report says.A 'chilling threat'The obstruction of Congress section of the report lays out the historical precedent for including it as an article of impeachment, explaining that House Democrats have to demonstrate that the President made no good faith effort to cooperate with their probe -- a standard they say has been clearly met.""Donald Trump is the first and only President in American history to openly and indiscriminately defy all aspects of the Constitutional impeachment process,"" the report says. ""Following President Trump's categorical order, not a single document has been produced by the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy.""Democrats also accused Trump of trying to intimidate witnesses and attacking those who responded to requests for subpoenas.""President Trump engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate witnesses who came forward,"" the report says, adding that the President's efforts ""deprived Congress and the public of additional evidence.""And the report criticizes Trump's ""obsessive"" focus on the whistleblower, alleging he made ""more than 100 public statements about the whistleblower over a period of just two months,"" including what the committee called a ""chilling threat"" -- his comment that the whistleblower should face the consequences for spying.In the report, Democrats allege that Trump's pressure campaign against the Ukrainians persists, with Trump still exerting control over the Ukrainian leader through the US's military and financial advantages. ""Although President Zelensky did not publicly announce the investigations that President Trump wanted, he remains under pressure from President Trump, particularly because he requires diplomatic, financial, and military backing from the United States, the most powerful supporter of Ukraine. That pressure continues to this day,"" the report says.Democrats also charge that Trump continues to solicit foreign interference -- from China and Russia -- to investigate the Bidens, adding to the urgency for Congress to respond: ""This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a US election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.""This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.CNN's Lauren Fox, Betsy Klein, Philip Mattingly, Haley Byrd, Marshall Cohen, Pamela Brown, David Shortell, Rene Marsh, Zachary Cohen, Gregory Wallace and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report."
How the FBI attempted to verify a salacious allegation in the Steele dossier,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/fbi-steele-dossier/index.html,"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department inspector general's report released Monday paints a more thorough picture than ever before on what the FBI found when it tried to verify information in Christopher Steele's dossier on Donald Trump and Russia -- including attempts to verify the existence of video tapes of ""alleged unorthodox sexual activity.""Steele's primary source for information in the dossier, for instance, told the FBI he or she may have talked about Trump's alleged sexual activities in ""jest"" and couldn't confirm whether the tape was real, the report states, quoting the source.""The Primary Sub-source explained that he/she reported to Steele that Trump's alleged unorthodox sexual activity at the Ritz Carlton hotel was 'rumor and speculation' and that he/she had not been able to confirm the story,"" the report states.Many of the claims by Steele, a former British spy, have held up over time, or have proven to be at least partially true, including the fact that there was a concerted Russian operation to attacking the 2016 US election. The Justice Department has brought criminal charges against dozens of Russian hackers and online trolls for allegedly interfering with the election.Steele's dossier had also asserted that Trump could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, among other things. The salacious allegations in Steele's memos remain unproven, nearly three years after the memos went public -- a point which the Horowitz report on Monday underlines.The report on Monday gives a thorough retelling of FBI officials' traveling abroad to interview Steele and a source of his and to keep track of allegations raised in the dossier in a spreadsheet. Inspector general Michael Horowitz described an extensive effort by the FBI to learn about Steele's sources and interview his primary source.Steele's primary source on the dossier told the FBI that Steele ""misstated or exaggerated"" his or her statements in the dossier, according to the inspector general's report. ""The FBI conducted interviews of [Steele's] Primary Sub-source in January, March, and May 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele election reporting,"" the report adds.Determining how the FBI used Steele's work and vetted it became key to the Justice Department inspector general this year, as inspector general Michael Horowitz looked into how the FBI cited Steele's dossier when it sought surveillance of former Trump adviser Carter Page.Horowitz notes some of the information Steele collected could have been disinformation planted by the Russians. The inspector general didn't attempt to vet this possibility, because it was outside of his office's scope, Horowitz wrote.(The Mueller report previously acknowledged the rumor of tapes of Trump existing but did not go into detail any findings about them.)How the FBI vetted the Steele dossierAt first, when the FBI was communicating with Steele, FBI leadership told the CIA they believed him to be a reliable source. Then-FBI official Andrew McCabe, now a CNN analyst, was pushing for the intelligence agencies to take Steele's reports on Trump seriously but his ""view did not prevail,"" Horowitz wrote. Steele had briefed the left-wing magazine Mother Jones about his work in October 2016, causing murmurs about the dossier to begin to circulate publicly. Because of this Mother Jones story, FBI stopped using Steele as a source, Horowitz noted.Beginning in mid-November 2016, the effort to verify the dossier began, Horowitz said. Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap -- then-FBI officials leading the Crossfire Hurricane investigation -- went abroad on the first trip, and Strzok, Lisa Page and others traveled abroad in December 2016. The investigators heard positive remarks from people who worked with Steele and also negative comments about him having poor judgment.""He was the type of person who would sometimes follow the shiny object without, perhaps, a deep set of judgment about the risk that may or may not be there in terms of following the shiny object. But in any event, he was not the type of person who would fabricate something or make something up or mischaracterize it, either intentionally or unintentionally,"" Strzok had told Horowitz during the inspector general's review.The FBI continued to evaluate Steele's information into 2017. At one point, the Crossfire Hurricane investigators created a spreadsheet with each of Steele's statements in the dossier to keep track as it vetted them. Some of the information was verified through publicly available information—though much of Steele's work couldn't be verified.That's because some of the details would have had to come from high-level people in Russia, Strzok had said, or from just a few people who witnessed meetings, Horowitz noted.Horowitz also noted that some of the details from the dossier were untrue, such as the allegation that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague in 2016 to meet with Russians. (Mueller previously asserted in his report that Cohen had never traveled to Prague, citing Cohen's repeated statements that he had not.)Steele's counterintelligence and election information in the dossier hadn't come into the FBI from another source, so the FBI's validation unit considered it to be uncorroborated. Horowitz recommended on Monday that the FBI should evaluate how the FBI validates reporting from its sources. FBI Director Chris Wray agreed with the recommendation and said it would made changes, according to his responses to Horowitz included in the report.The FBI also interviewed Steele in September 2017 over two days, Horowitz wrote. After the last Page FISA warrant application went to the foreign surveillance court with mention of Steele's work in it, the FBI found that Steele had become biased against Trump, the inspector general found.""The FBI discovered discrepancies between Steele's reporting and statements sub-sources made to the FBI, which raised doubts about the reliability of some of Steele's reports. The FBI also assessed the possibility that Russia was funneling disinformation to Steele, and the possibility that disinformation was included in his election reports,"" Horowitz wrote.""The FBI concluded, among other things, that although consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, much of the material in the Steele election reports, including allegations about Donald Trump and members of the Trump campaign relied upon in the Carter Page FISA applications, could not be corroborated; that certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent with information gathered by the Crossfire Hurricane team; and that the limited information that was corroborated related to time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available."""
Trump again mocks teen climate activist Greta Thunberg,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/trump-greta-thunberg-time-person-of-the-year/index.html,"Thunberg, who was named Time magazine's Person of the Year earlier this week over Trump, has sternly castigated world leaders for not doing enough to combat the climate crisis, and memorably stared down Trump at the UN General Assembly in September. She has been open about her diagnosis of Asperger's, calling it a ""superpower"" that helps her activism.""So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"" Trump wrote Thursday morning, responding to a tweet congratulating Thunberg on being named Person of the Year.Trump frequently attacks and mocks political enemies on Twitter, and previously went after Thunberg in September, though his Thursday morning broadside was still jarring coming from a sitting US president against a teenager.Following the President's tweet, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Trump's comments: ""A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.""In September, following her excoriation of world leaders at the UN, Trump tweeted of Thunberg: ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" At the time, Thunberg also updated her Twitter bio to refer to herself using Trump's words.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner who has often taken Trump to task for his behavior, chastised the President for his tweet.""What kind of president bullies a teenager? @realDonaldTrump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader,"" Biden said on Twitter.Time magazine announced Wednesday that it had chosen Thunberg as its Person of the Year, making her the youngest individual to be recognized.""Thunberg has become the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet—and the avatar of a broader generational shift in our culture that is playing out everywhere from the campuses of Hong Kong to the halls of Congress in Washington,"" Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote.Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry and Hong Kong protesters were on the shortlist for who has been the most influential this year. Trump deeply covets being Person of the Year: he thanked Time when he was chosen in 2016 and lashed out at the magazine a year later when he was passed over."
Lawmakers are close to reaching a defense bill that will also include paid family leave for federal workers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/federal-paid-family-leave-ndaa/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Lawmakers are close to reaching a deal on the annual defense authorization bill that for the first time will include paid family leave for federal workers. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democratic negotiators have secured a tentative agreement for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include a significant provision requiring 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all federal employees, a congressional source familiar with the negotiations told CNN. A Republican source also confirmed that paid leave would be included in the bill, which is not yet finished. Republicans have resisted including the measure in the bill, according to the congressional source. The Washington Post on Friday, citing four people with knowledge of the deal, reported the paid family leave provision was agreed to in exchange for making ""Space Force"" the sixth branch of the US military. Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter and senior adviser, however, expressed strong support for the provision on behalf of the White House. ""As the country's largest employer, the United States Government must lead by example.  After 3 years of relentless advocacy, the passage of the NDAA will secure Paid Parental Leave for ALL federal employees,"" she said in a statement on Friday. ""This will mark a HUGE step forward towards making paid leave a reality for all Americans. This new policy represents another incredible win for millions of hard-working American families courtesy of President Trump!""The first daughter has met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on the topic of paid family leave during her time as a senior adviser to the President, part of her neatly-tailored West Wing portfolio focused on women's economic empowerment and workforce development. The White House sought to give her credit for the news. ""Over the last three years, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump has met with more than 60 lawmakers to ensure that paid family leave policies are on the table. During the last few weeks, those advocacy efforts have ramped up even further, resulting in today's exciting news,"" a White House official said. While a provision for federal workers is a step forward, a bipartisan deal on paid family leave for all Americans could still be a heavy lift in Congress, with Democrats and Republicans still split on how to pay for it and how broad a national paid leave policy should be. In the past four years, the number of lawmakers supportive of paid family leave has more than doubled. In the previous 115th Congress, 205 members of Congress signed onto some type of paid family leave legislation, compared to just 80 members of Congress in the 111th.Earlier this week, Trump expressed support for bipartisan, bicameral paid leave legislation introduced by Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Colin Allred of Texas, saying the White House ""applauds"" their efforts. "
Buttigieg to open fundraisers to press and publish names of top fundraisers after calls for transparency,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/buttigieg-fundraisers-opened-to-public/index.html," (CNN)Pete Buttigieg's campaign will begin to allow the press to cover his high-dollar fundraisers, the campaign announced on Monday after some of his Democratic presidential opponents called on him to be more transparent about the time he spends with top donors.The South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign will also make the names of his so-called bundlers -- plugged in Democrats who help raise money for the campaigns -- public.""In a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign,"" said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg's campaign manager, in a statement. ""Fundraising events with Pete will be open to press beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.""Buttigieg, more than any other Democratic candidate other than former Vice President Joe Biden, has spent a significant time on the campaign trail at top-dollar fundraisers, building a substantial campaign bank account that has helped fuel his unexpected rise from small city mayor to top tier Democratic presidential candidate.But the mayor's rise has corresponded with more attention from his opponents like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has faulted Buttigieg for holding private events with top donors -- something she has not done during her presidential campaign -- and called on the mayor to open his future events to the press.""The mayor should be releasing who's on his finance committee, who are the bundlers who are raising big money for him, who he's given titles to and made promises to, and he should open up the doors so that the press can follow the promises that he's making in these big dollar fundraisers,"" Warren said earlier this month, tying the call to rooting out corruption.Buttigieg's campaign, days after those calls, now says he will open his once-private fundraisers.""From the start, Pete has said it is important for every candidate to be open and honest, and his actions have reflected that commitment,"" Schmuhl said. ""He is the only current presidential candidate who has released the names of people raising money for his campaign, and we will continue to release additional names as more people join our growing effort. Moreover, he will be one of the few candidates to allow reporters access to his fundraising events.""One reason for the pressure on Buttigieg has been the fact that Biden, the other candidate headlining numerous top-dollar events, has opened all of his fundraisers to a small group of reporters.Buttigieg has headlined hundreds of private fundraisers in 2019, crisscrossing the nation to raise millions from wealthy Americans. In total, Buttigieg has raised over $51 million for his presidential campaign, including money raised online, according to the Federal Election Commission.The mayor's aggressive fundraising will continue in the coming week, too: Buttigieg will headline 16 fundraisers in six states and Washington, DC, over the next seven days, according to invites obtained by CNN, including top dollar events in San Francisco, Seattle and Manhattan.Buttigieg has long declined to open his fundraisers, with his campaign initially arguing that they didn't have the infrastructure to host press at these events.""I'll leave the press policy to the folks on the press side, but we can talk about it,"" Buttigieg said in October.As candidates pushed him on his use of top dollar fundraisers, Buttigieg got into a tense exchange with reporters when pressed on opening his events.""There are a lot of considerations, and I'm thinking about it,"" Buttigieg said.""Can you give us those considerations?"" he was asked.""No,"" he replied.At another event, Buttigieg told CNN, ""I just want to make sure we do it in the, you know, if we approach this, that we do it in the right way. The team's working through options and invite you to stay tuned in the coming days as we think about possible updates."""
Ex-WH economic adviser says he's concerned no one is left in White House to challenge Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/gary-cohn-trump-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said he's ""concerned"" there is no one left in the White House to stand up to President Donald Trump and tell him ""what he doesn't want to hear.""""We had an interesting nucleus of people when I was in the White House -- the initial team. We were not bashful. It was a group that was willing to tell the President what he needed to know, whether he wanted to hear it or not,"" Cohn told CNN's David Axelrod in an interview on ""The Axe Files"" podcast released Monday. ""None of us are there any more. So I am concerned that the atmosphere in the White House is no longer conducive, or no one has the personality to stand up and tell the President what he doesn't want to hear,"" he said.Cohn resigned from his position as Trump's top economic adviser in March 2018 in the wake of his fierce disagreement with the President's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. His exit sounded alarm bells in establishment circles in Washington and on Wall Street, where many viewed the former Goldman Sachs executive as a steadying influence on economic policy inside the Trump White House.Cohn's comments echo remarks from former White House chief of staff John Kelly in October when he said he had warned the President before he left the White House not to hire a replacement who wouldn't tell him the truth or tell he that he wouldn't be impeached.""I said, whatever you do — and we were still in the process of trying to find someone to take my place — I said whatever you do, don't hire a 'yes man,' someone who won't tell you the truth — don't do that,"" Kelly said.Reflecting on his role in the White House, Cohn said he thought he would be able influence Trump more within his administration than in an outside capacity. ""I thought I could potentially sway him, and I also know, historically, that sometimes what you run on is not exactly what you mean when you come to govern,"" he said. ""In my mind, having a seat on the inside and trying to influence was better than being on the outside and trying to get to a more positive outcome on, you know, climate, on trade, on immigration.""Cohn added: ""I come from a fact-based world. If I can empirically show you facts and I can show you reality, that's supposed to win the day.""""I went in overly prepared with factual analysis, and in many respects, look, it may not have ended up where I wanted it to end up, but he's the ultimate decision-maker,"" he said. ""I'm supposed to do my job and make sure that he understands the impact of that decision.""CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report. "
"Biden, 'The Irishman' and the enduring power of aging white men",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/the-irishman-joe-biden-michael-bloomberg-bernie-sanders/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Joe Biden this week had a tense exchange with an audience member during an Iowa town hall who had asserted, among other things, that the former vice president is ""too old"" to helm the White House.""You wanna check my shape on it, let's do push-ups together, man, let's run, let's do whatever you wanna do,"" Biden, 77, said.While the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has since downplayed the incident, his posturing was revealing. It's of a piece with a deeper stress in the Democratic race: The party is growing diversity-wise, but in important ways it's still marked by septuagenarian white men -- including Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (77), and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (78).You could think of this trend as a fascinating foil for two of this year's most acclaimed movies: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and ""The Irishman.""The former, directed by Quentin Tarantino, charts a man's shaggy journey as he comes to terms with the fact that he's become a pop-cultural relic. And the latter, by Martin Scorsese, is a machismo-fueled gangster epic about how life wears you down.The two films are thoughtful reckonings with aging, specifically with the atrophying of a certain, narrow performance of manhood and the attendant anxieties of that decline. Both also shine a light on how that same sort of rigorous reflection often doesn't happen in the stubborn, real-life political world -- but should.Toward the beginning of ""Once Upon a Time,"" Leonardo DiCaprio's character, an actor, clues viewers in on one of the movie's primary conflicts when he says to his stunt double, played by Brad Pitt: ""It's official, old buddy. I'm a has been. ... If coming face to face with the failure that is your career ain't worth crying about, then I don't know what the f*** is.""His celebrity, which for years has hinged on the particular masculinity of mid-century Westerns, is losing its luster.In a similar vein, Robert De Niro's mob figure, when looking back on his decades spent as part of the criminal underbelly, remarks: ""Russell, he had a stroke. Fat Tony, he couldn't control his urine no more. And my arthritis, that started in the foxholes of Anzio, was eating away at my lower back now, and I couldn't feel much in my feet no more. I needed a cane."" It's a humble account of how time catches up with everyone -- big-boss men, too.""('Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and 'The Irishman' are) full of an awareness that a moment for a kind of movie -- and for a kind of long-celebrated male character -- is passing, perhaps deservedly,"" the journalist and film historian Mark Harris writes. ""Both movies take as their subject the waning of an alpha-male primacy that has dominated film culture.""Different worldHow different the world -- and people's appraisal of it -- is off the screen!Consider Bloomberg. When the CBS News anchor Gayle King probed in an interview that aired on Friday about the narrative ""Here we go, another old white gentleman"" and how Bloomberg's candidacy is at odds with the Democrats' vision of change, the former New York City mayor dodged.""Maybe. But lots of people can enter. If you wanted to enter and run for President of the United States, you could've done that. But don't complain to me that you're not in the race. It was up to you,"" Bloomberg said.It was a guarded response, one that was telling of the times in how it seemed to breezily disregard a bit of recent news: the fact that California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was the race's only black female candidate, dropped out partly to avoid debt just shortly after Bloomberg had used his wealth to enter.Or take, once again, Biden. Ahead of the Iowa caucuses in February, his campaign is testing out a slogan: ""NO MALARKEY!"" The point is to communicate Biden's cut-to-the-chase approach to politics. The term's mixed reception, however, is illustrative of the sentiment held by a number of people that a candidate with so much experience over so many years is out of touch today.""While some voters welcomed the slogan as a throwback to a calmer era, others said it will only alienate younger voters,"" Politico's Natasha Korecki recently reported. ""But many said, bottom line, they don't quite get it. ... Some Iowans offered up their own loose translation for malarkey, along the lines of: 'How old is this guy?' ""And yet, despite Biden's at times questionable relevance, the former vice president's position in the polls has remained steady. That's to an extent due to the hazy sense of ease he telegraphs to some voters; how he registers as having the ""right"" profile -- older, white, male -- to trounce President Donald Trump (who, notably, is 73) in a high-stakes political contest.EnduranceYou could make a similar argument regarding Sanders. The question of whether someone is past their prime has stalked him arguably more than his competitors, especially in the wake of his heart attack in October. The Vermont senator's health scare forced him to recalibrate his routine as he sought to prove that he's capable of leading.But in another sign of today's not-like-the-movies political situation, Sanders appeared to gain momentum in the weeks after his campaign announced that he had been hospitalized. Likewise, his first comeback rally, held in New York City with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, attracted a reported 26,000 people -- larger than any of his rivals' events this year.""Sanders' standing has only increased since he had that incident,"" the Iowa Democratic strategist Jeff Link told Politico in November. ""It was a wake-up call for people who were totally committed to Bernie, like: 'We got to make this time count.' ""All of which is to say: These men -- ones like them -- don't seem to be going anywhere.This isn't to beat up on the Democratic Party over its image problem. After all, the GOP is much more homogenous.Rather, it's to highlight how, for a party for whom diversity isn't gloss, it still struggles mightily to reflect its base in a meaningful manner. And in some cases, there's a protectiveness over the status quo -- or at least a reluctance to challenge it.Bringing the party's reality in line with its possibility will require that the Democrats ask themselves what ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""The Irishman"" quietly ask their audiences: What does the future look like? And how might we figure in it?"

Months of overlapping objectives, trips, events and interactions with the President have created a shaky alliance, as reported in ""Free, Melania: The Unauthorized Biography,"" available Tuesday.A spokeswoman for Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham, tells CNN that the two women ""always shared a close relationship and still do today.""Melania Trump's first big solo trip was to the African continent, as was Ivanka Trump's first big solo trip. The first lady was the first to introduce highly produced mini-videos of her events for public consumption, and now Ivanka Trump also makes her own short films, with voice-overs and music. While these points may seem trivial, the similarities have reportedly caused static.On presidential trips, when Melania Trump goes, the first daughter's profile diminishes -- and when the first lady is absent, Ivanka Trump steps up.It has created an odd dynamic that has left Ivanka and Melania Trump switching off front seat-back seat as the two women in Trump's orbit, a relationship that has created friction.It was during Trump's presidential campaign that family life shifted to politics, and the dynamics changed as well.Melania Trump, uninterested in the constant travel involved on the campaign trail, and hoping to maintain a semblance of normalcy for her young son, stayed away for the most part, remaining in New York City. Out on the campaign trail, it was Ivanka Trump who stepped into her space. Ivanka Trump, a seasoned public speaker who is comfortable in the spotlight, was able to serve as surrogate campaigner in lieu of Melania Trump.The President's daughter maintained her role as one of the most prominent female faces of the family and administration, moving immediately to Washington, setting up her office as a senior adviser to her father. Her portfolio also grew to include more championing of issues around women and family, which have traditionally been the domain of first ladies. Ivanka Trump lent her support to women's economic development, child tax credits and pushing for STEM programs for children and young adults.""The most important investment we can make as a country is in the next generation of Americans, and we're doing just that through our tax code,"" said Ivanka Trump in one of her social media videos, designed to capitalize on her photogenic popularity.Ivanka Trump also learned to navigate the media, often selectively leaking her involvement, or lack thereof, in headline-making policies.The tension between the two manifested itself over credit for influencing the President into changing his mind on one of his administration's most controversial policies: child separation at the border.When images of children being separated from their families flooded Twitter feeds and news programs last year, a source said Melania Trump told the President the zero-tolerance policy had to end, and quickly. She organized a trip with little notice to fly to McAllen, Texas, and see for herself what was happening at an immigrant intake facility. ""I'm headed down to Texas,"" Melania Trump told Donald Trump, according to one White House source. Shortly thereafter she went, but she didn't leave until she was certain her husband would sign an executive order ostensibly ending the zero-tolerance separation policy. Ivanka Trump, at the same time, was also letting it be known that she was trying to convince her father to pull the plug on zero tolerance. This all coincided with a few punishing days for her on social media. (As the photos and stories of families being torn apart ran rampant, Ivanka Trump had posted some personal shots of herself and her young sons on Twitter and Instagram, a move that her most gentle critics called ""tone deaf,"" and the harsher ones deemed an example of her living ""in a bubble."") Both women, separately, and with their own signature styles -- Melania Trump quietly and one-on-one with her husband, and Ivanka Trump via the media and her relationships with lawmakers -- were pressing for action.When the President did sign the executive order, he gave both women credit. ""Ivanka feels very strongly about it,"" but also, next breath, ""My wife feels very strongly about it."" But Melania Trump boarded her government jet wearing the now-infamous, $39 ""I really don't care, do u?"" jacket, a lost-in-translation message that was possibly a jab at Ivanka Trump, for drifting into the first lady's lane. Melania Trump wearing anything that inexpensive, much less from fast-fashion brand Zara (a label worn with frequency by Ivanka Trump during that period,) was out of step with the first lady's regular sartorial preferences, and overt negative messaging was not by experience or observation Melania Trump's style. Her spokeswoman, Grisham, after the offensive jacket took over the news cycle, officially said that she had worn it as a message to a meddling media.In a way, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump are splitting -- and will continue to split -- the traditional roles that most spouses or female counterparts to male politicians have, but they share the most critical component: the President's ear. They are the only two members of the administration who have the freedom and power of total job security -- one a first daughter and the other a first lady."
US tests missile previously banned under arms control treaty with Russia,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/pentagon-missile-test/index.html,"""The Department of Defense conducted a flight test of a conventionally-configured ground-launched ballistic missile at approximately 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time, today, Dec. 12, 2019, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California,"" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Carver told CNN in a statement.The test comes just two days after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Washington for talks with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. During the visit, Lavrov criticized the US decision to leave the INF Treaty and urged Washington to renew the New START Treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between Russia and the United States. Carver said that the missile tested Thursday ""terminated in the open ocean after more than 500 kilometers of flight. Data collected and lessons learned from this test will inform the Department of Defense's development of future intermediate-range capabilities.""'Unilateral moratorium'The 1987 INF Treaty banned land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and missile launchers with ranges of 500 to 1,000 kilometers, but the US and NATO have long accused Russia of testing and fielding missiles that were in violation of the pact. This is the second test of an intermediate range land-based missile by the US since it left the INF Treaty. The US military launched a land-based cruise missile in August that would also have been prohibited.The US and its NATO allies have said that Moscow has already fielded such a missile, the SSC-8/9M729. Russia has denied fielding an intermediate missile and has blamed the US for the treaty's demise.""We have directed the attention of our partners at the negative consequences of the US stepping out of the INF Treaty,"" Lavrov said Tuesday during a news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. Lavrov said Russia was announcing ""a unilateral moratorium on deploying such missiles and they will not be deployed up until then and in those regions, up until the point where the similar systems appear, the American systems appear.""The Russian foreign minister said that ""suggestion was made to our Western partners, including the US, for such a moratorium to become mutual. This offer remains on the table.""  China, which was not party to the INF Treaty, also fields a significant number of intermediate range missiles. The development of a new American intermediate range missile has been opposed by some members of Congress. The recently passed National Defense Authorization Act ""prohibits the procurement and deployment of new ground launched INF-range missiles in fiscal year 2020 and requires information on the analysis of alternatives to such new missiles, basing options and foreign countries consulted, including NATO"" according to the bill's summary.Asked Thursday if the test meant that the US will deploy intermediate range missiles, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon ""once we develop intermediate range missiles and if my commanders require them, then we will work closely and consult closely with our allies in Europe, Asia and elsewhere with regard to any possible deployments.""But there is also concern that America's European and Asian allies would be unwilling to host intermediate range missiles if the US sought to deploy them to counter Russian or Chinese deployments."
Former Republican lawmakers tell current GOP: Consider full evidence on impeachment,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/former-lawmakers-listen-impeachment-gop-cnntv/index.html," (CNN)Two former Republican lawmakers urged their current successors to consider the evidence produced during the inquiry into President Donald Trump's Ukraine dealings in determining whether to support impeachment.William Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine and secretary of defense who backed impeachment during the Watergate inquiry, and Slade Gorton, a former Washington state Republican senator and attorney general who also backed President Richard Nixon's impeachment, made the comments on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Friday evening. Their counsel comes on the same day that Rep. Justin Amash, a Michigan independent who left the Republican Party this summer, announced that he would support impeachment articles against Trump -- the first lawmaker to do so who is not a Democrat. ""I would say, listen to the witnesses,"" Cohen replied when asked what he thought of Republicans dismissing the probe as a sham. ""Listen to the professionals who came before the Congress to swear under oath.""""You're saying that all those people who came before the committee are lying under oath,"" Cohen said, urging lawmakers ""to go back and look at the entire spectrum from the Mueller report. There's a pattern here of (Trump) saying, 'I'm not beholden to anyone.' ""Gorton said he felt ""sorry for the people who are tying themselves so heavily to the President at this point,"" adding that ""they should be waiting to hear all of the facts."" ""I think it's very easy for them to determine that the President did this, did what he's accused of,"" he said, adding that ""it's one thing to say, we don't think that arises to the importance to take a man out of the presidential office. It's quite another to denounce it in advance when you don't know what there's going to be presented to you.""Gorton, while criticizing Democrats for failing to attract bipartisan support, also highlighted the potential power of public opinion in convincing Republicans to back impeachment.""If public opinion swings towards favoring getting rid of the President there will be Republican senators who will reflect on that,"" he said. ""It's not there at this point, but that's a very real possibility. It's unfortunate that the Democrats who are running this system so far haven't tried to appeal as broadly as is necessary for that, but they may -- I think it's an open question."""
Barr saying inspector general report won't be the last word on FBI Russia probe,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/william-barr-inspector-general-report-fbi-russia-investigation/index.html," (CNN)The forthcoming release of an internal Justice Department watchdog report on the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation won't be the last word on the matter, Attorney General William Barr has told conservative allies.Long a skeptic of the Russia probe, and particularly the FBI's tactics to investigate Trump campaign associates, Barr believes questions remain about some of the intelligence and other information the FBI used to pursue the investigation, according to people at the Justice Department and in Congress familiar with his thinking. That view stands in contrast to what is expected from Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report, due to be released next Monday, which is expected to conclude that the FBI's investigation was legally predicated, despite errors and potential wrongdoing by some lower-level FBI employees involved in it, CNN reported last month. ""The inspector general's investigation is a credit to the Department of Justice,"" said Kerri Kupec, Justice Department spokeswoman. ""His excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves. Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the inspector general's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters."" Long before Horowitz's report was complete, Barr had already decided the inspector general's review wouldn't be enough to answer some of his concerns, some of which he has made public.In 2017, before he became attorney general, Barr told The New York Times that he thought the Justice Department had more reason to investigate Hillary Clinton and her family's foundation -- along with a conspiracy theory involving a Uranium mining company -- than it did to investigate Donald Trump. ""I have long believed that the predicate for investigating the uranium deal, as well as the foundation, is far stronger than any basis for investigating so-called 'collusion,' "" he told the Times. Even after initial internal briefings as attorney general earlier this year, Barr told other Justice officials he had information that bolstered some of his qualms about the department's handling of the Russia probe. It's not clear where he obtained that information. Barr is a voracious consumer of conservative media, including some organizations that have fed skepticism about Russian election interference and the activities of Trump campaign associates. Horowitz's jurisdiction extends only to the Justice Department and its agencies, including the FBI, and the inspector general investigators didn't speak to intelligence agency employees. His report is expected to measure the FBI's conduct based on current Justice Department standards. The threshold of evidence needed to open a counterintelligence investigation is relatively low, and Barr has suggested that the department may need to tighten procedures for counterintelligence investigations that involve political campaigns.Earlier this year Barr appointed John Durham, a Connecticut federal prosecutor, to conduct what he said was a broader investigation, which is reviewing actions by the CIA and other intelligence agencies that provided information to the FBI probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Durham's work is expected to continue into next year. It's not uncommon for attorneys general to disagree with inspector general conclusions, and at times they have made those disputes clear in responses appended to their watchdogs' reports. A person familiar with the matter says there aren't plans for Barr to include a formal rebuttal to Horowitz's findings in the final inspector general report. Instead, Barr has told allies to wait for Durham's investigation, which he believes will be more complete. Still, next week's release of the Horowitz report will likely present an awkward split-screen moment for the Justice Department: the internal watchdog presenting findings that provide backing of the Justice Department's handling of a high-profile investigation, with the attorney general refusing to embrace those findings and instead promising there's more to come.

"Congress clinches sweeping spending deal, putting off shutdown threat",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/deal-in-principle-on-2020-spending-bills-reached/index.html,"The bipartisan foursome of the top appropriators reached the agreement after meeting in the Capitol on Thursday, capping a day of harried negotiations, proposals and counter proposals that will significantly curtail the threat of a government shutdown. Staff will work through the weekend to produce the final legislation, which will likely move in two separate packages that receive House floor votes on Tuesday, according to an aide. The $1.37 trillion agreement includes all 12 spending bills and came after a day of last-minute negotiations and shuttle diplomacy between Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, and his House counterpart Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, along with the two ranking members on their committees, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, and Rep. Kay Granger, a Texas Republican. At various points meetings included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the Trump administration's point person on the negotiations.It also came as time was running out to reach an agreement that could be moved through both the House and Senate before the December 20 funding deadline. President Donald Trump will also have to sign the measure into law and has yet to weigh in publicly, but Mnuchin and Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, were regularly apprised, and often present, during some of the final stages of the negotiations.  The tentative agreement still left some issues to ironed out over the course of the weekend, aides said, but the topline agreement and momentum to move forward before lawmakers leave town for the Christmas holiday creates a momentum that generally carries final negotiations across the finish line.The seeds of the agreement were planted in the bipartisan budget agreement reached in July, but for months the two parties, and two chambers, failed to make significant progress on reconciling the spending measures themselves. Regular holdups, including Trump's request of billions in border wall funding and funds for immigration related matters, abortion, and recently, a parochial California dispute between Pelosi and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy plagued the talks, but several other significant issues were outstanding as recently as Thursday morning, people involved in the talks said. The White House signaled in negotiations it would accept significantly less money -- the current level of $1.375 billion -- than requested on the border wall in exchange for maintaining the authority to transfer funds from Pentagon accounts to finance new wall construction, according to people involved in the talks. That agreement made it into the final deal, a source familiar with the talks said. The deal does not include any money backfilling the $3.6 billion in military construction funds the administration transferred earlier this year to fund the wall -- a key priority for Democrats.    The agreement was driven in large part by incentives that made a short-term agreement to freeze spending levels into 2020 increasingly untenable for key players. A continuing resolution, a backstop if talks failed, likely would've led lawmakers to lose the nearly $100 billion in additional money secured in the budget agreement. The threat of election year politics and a divisive Senate impeachment trial led aides and lawmakers to believe a sweeping agreement on all 12 bills was unlikely if negotiations slipped into 2020. Pelosi and McConnell committed to one another during a phone call last month that they would push for a final agreement on all 12 bills -- including the thorny Department of Homeland Security measure.Over the final day of negotiations, one that started with people involved questioning whether a deal was even possible, a list of dozens of outstanding issues was narrowed down piece by piece through the various meetings. The final meeting between the ""four corners"" of Shelby, Lowey, Granger and Leahy secured the final agreement. It was the same group that reached the deal to end the longest government shutdown in US history -- which began one year ago this month. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."
Vulnerable House Democrats anxiously eye impeachment vote,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/impeachment-vote-lawmakers/index.html," (CNN)As the House Judiciary Committee held its first impeachment hearing into President Donald Trump this week, some of the House's most vulnerable Democrats privately huddled to discuss how to protect their majority.  At the headquarters of the House Democrats' campaign arm, they talked about what they were hearing back home and were briefed on an internal poll surveying 57 battleground districts from October to November, according to a source familiar, which showed support for impeaching and removing Trump had stayed about the same — slightly trailing the opposition — despite a Republican onslaught. While independents had surged to support it, Republicans had rallied around their party leader.While the polling was meant to reassure Democrats from highly competitive districts, they are still uneasy about the historic vote they're about to cast, which could have major ramifications for the country and their races.""I'm totally undecided,"" Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York, a freshman from a competitive district who had initially resisted an impeachment inquiry, said Friday. ""Anytime you talk about impeaching a president -- the third time in our nation's history -- that's a very serious vote. I take it very seriously.""The day after the briefing, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would proceed with articles of impeachment, setting up a vote that will present a tricky choice for the 31 Democrats in Trump districts. Hours later, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager, tweeted that ""impeachment is killing"" freshman House Democrats — ""and polling proves it."" He then tweeted an internal poll showing that in Oklahoma Rep. Kendra Horn's district, less than half of respondents support impeachment — a surprisingly high number there, but one that still showed that a slim majority of her constituents did not want her to vote to impeach the President.Like many other Democrats in red districts, Horn told CNN that she's still deciding on how to vote, waiting to see ""all the information,"" including how the articles of impeachment will be written. The charges laid out during Wednesday's hearing include abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. Democrats say Trump put his personal interest over the country's when he pressured Ukraine to announce politically-damaging investigations of Democrats, while using military aid and a White House meeting coveted by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as leverage.Some Democrats hope that their colleagues do not expand the articles further, or include episodes of alleged obstruction of justice found in the Mueller report in the articles.On Friday, several freshmen Democrats bluntly warned their leadership not to include evidence from the Mueller report in the articles of impeachment. Their argument: They only got behind an impeachment inquiry because it was narrowly focused on Ukraine -- and didn't believe the evidence that Trump sought to derail an investigation into his presidency and the 2016 campaign were sufficient grounds for impeachment.""No,"" Brinidisi said flatly when asked if he'd be inclined to support an article that includes Mueller evidence. ""I'm going to see what the articles are that are put on the floor. ... It's my job to decide whether that evidence fits those articles of impeachment.""California Rep. Gil Cisneros said Democrats ""need to stay focused on Ukraine,"" citing how he and a group of more moderate members endorsed an impeachment inquiry after Trump's actions with Ukraine prompted national security concerns. ""It was about Ukraine, and the President putting our national security at risk. That's what I'm ready to vote on.""But few of these Democratic members really want to debate what should or should not be included in articles — they'd rather not talk about this at all. Horn said her constituents are primarily concerned about education, funding the government and health care, calling prescription drug pricing ""one of the biggest issues that comes up just over and over and over again."" ""It's an ongoing question, but it's also not the only thing that's happening,"" she said of impeachment.The members have grown tired of a media that is covering all developments of the impeachment inquiry. When a CNN reporter approached him on Friday, Rep. Joe Cunningham of South Carolina said he'd like to discuss the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, before duly fielding questions from a number of reporters on impeachment. Cunningham said the allegations against Trump are ""very serious"" but wasn't sure how he'd vote until he saw the articles.""I wasn't elected to impeach the President,"" he added. ""And I also wasn't elected to protect the President.""Republicans are predicting that the impeachment vote will flip the House. On Thursday, Rep. Tom Emmer, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee said, ""House Democrats' unhealthy obsession with trying to remove the President of the United States from office and undo the 2016 election will cost them their majority next year.""For weeks, the Republican political groups have worked to make that happen. Last month, the conservative American Action Network launched a $7 million television and digital ad campaign directed at Rep. Max Rose of New York and other House Democrats in Trump districts.Rose dismissed the notion that the vote will be politically difficult for him.""Nothing we do here is difficult,"" said Rose. ""Nothing we do here is hard. I've got cops and I've got firemen going and risking their lives each and every day in New York City. We got soldiers in combat right now. That's hard. None of this is difficult, alright? This is cushy s---."""
US prosecutors turn to possible bribery charges in investigation over Ukrainian natural gas company,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/rudy-giuliani-lev-parnas-igor-fruman-new-york-ukraine-naftogaz/index.html,"The fresh line of inquiry has accelerated in recent weeks. New York federal prosecutors have interviewed two senior executives at Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state-run energy company, and requested interviews with at least two others who are believed to have some knowledge of the alleged scheme by Giuliani's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to replace Naftogaz's chief executive in hopes of bettering their business prospects.The questions connected to Naftogaz suggest prosecutors -- who have been investigating Parnas, Fruman and Giuliani as part of a broad inquiry that includes potential foreign lobbying violations -- are also looking at whether yet another law was violated, legal experts say. The law, called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, prohibits a US company or individual from giving any payment, offer of payment or anything of value to a foreign official in order to obtain or retain business.A spokesman for the US attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.The sequence of events surrounding Naftogaz appears to meet many of the elements necessary for a foreign bribery charge, according to former federal prosecutors. ""Any time you have some international business angle, thoughts understandably turn to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,"" said Harry Sandick, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan US Attorney's office.Parnas and Fruman were indicted in October on charges of violating campaign finance laws by funneling foreign money into US elections and disguising the true source of other donations. Since then, prosecutors have pursued a broader case that includes questions about Giuliani's role, and prosecutors and FBI agents have interviewed political donors and fundraisers and subpoenaed others seeking any communications they've had with Giuliani about actual or potential business deals. According to one grand jury subpoena issued as part of the inquiry, prosecutors are exploring whether laws including money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, obstruction of justice and wire fraud may have been violated. Prosecutors said last week that additional charges are ""likely."" The Soviet-born American businessmen have pleaded not guilty.RELATED: Federal prosecutors ask judge to revoke bail for indicted associate of Rudy GiulianiIn the case of Naftogaz, Parnas and Fruman approached a senior executive at the company and offered to make him CEO in hopes of drumming up business from Naftogaz for their newly created liquified natural gas operation. While making their pitch to the senior executive, Andrew Favorov, he has said, the two touted their ties to Giuliani and suggested US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom they viewed as opposed to their interests, would soon be removed. Yovanovitch later lost her job at least in part as a result of a scheme conducted by Parnas and Fruman, according to prosecutors.Favorov said he rejected the pitch. He and Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev have been interviewed by prosecutors, according to an attorney who represents both men.Giuliani's role in the alleged attempted scheme isn't clear. When Parnas and Fruman approached Favorov about the deal, they began their meeting by showing him pictures of them with Giuliani and text messages exchanged with President Donald Trump's personal attorney while conveying to Favorov that ""Rudy's on our team,"" according to a person familiar with the encounter. This person added that Parnas and Fruman appeared to use Giuliani's name to try to bolster their credibility but Favorov was not given any indication that Giuliani was, in fact, involved in the business.Prosecutors are exploring Giuliani's business ties with Parnas and Fruman and whether he had any connection to Global Energy Producers, their liquified natural gas company. Robert Costello, an attorney for Giuliani, has said he had no financial interests in GEP.Around the same time, Ukrainians complained to US officials that Giuliani was pushing for changes to the supervisory board of Naftogaz while he also sought investigations of the Bidens, according to testimony during the House impeachment inquiry by Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.Regardless of whether Giuliani played any substantive role in Parnas and Fruman's pitch to replace the company's CEO, legal experts say their actions appear to contain the components for a foreign bribery charge.One significant element of such a charge requires that the thing of value -- in this case, the CEO position -- be offered to a foreign official. Favorov is a US citizen, but because Naftogaz is state-owned, he would be considered a foreign official in the eyes of prosecutors, said Berit Berger, a former New York federal prosecutor who is now executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School.""DOJ has taken the position that employees of a state-owned business are foreign officials for the purpose of FCPA,"" Berger said. ""I don't think it matters that he was an American citizen as long as he was conducting the business of Naftogaz.""Berger pointed out that the charge does not require that the thing of value actually have been given, merely that it was offered, making Favorov's rejection of the proposal irrelevant to whether Parnas and Fruman broke the law.The charge also requires that the scheme has a nexus to the US, which former prosecutors said could be satisfied by the fact that Parnas and Fruman made their pitch at an energy conference in Houston, Texas, according to Favorov, as well as by the fact that Favorov is a US citizen."
Analysis: What Biden's 'damn liar' exchange shows when it comes to his candidacy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/joe-biden-iowa-voter-confrontation-analysis/index.html," (CNN)Joe Biden's feisty exchange with a retired Iowa farmer on Thursday perfectly captured the perils and the potential of his candidacy.In a human moment defending his son, Biden showed the authenticity, emotion and readiness for a fight that appeals to so many Democrats as they look for someone who can take on Trump.At the same time, the elder statesman who is supposed to be the antidote to President Donald Trump was undisciplined and undeniably macho -- reminding voters he's an at times undisciplined contender who almost seemed ready for fisticuffs with a hostile questioner. Thursday afternoon's exchange could benefit Biden at a time when Democrats say toughness is one of their most coveted assets in their battle against Trump.It could help Biden allay the doubts of Democratic voters who have continually complained in interviews that the former vice president is too soft-spoken; too slow compared to his pace in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns; and too flat-footed when attacked during debates by the likes of Kamala Harris and Julián Castro.Though most political consultants would counsel their candidates not to personally attack voters as Biden did Thursday, he at least looked like he wouldn't shy away from the fight.At a deeper level, Biden knows that one of his biggest challenges is the relentless effort by President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and other Republican leaders to falsely define him as some kind of corrupt operator who sought lucrative gigs for his son in Ukraine.Trump has shown a unique talent for that kind of attack on his opponents. One needs to look no further than the field of fallen 2016 GOP candidates and his relentless jibes against ""crooked"" Hillary Clinton and her missing emails to see the damage he can inflict. As much as Biden has tried to avoid getting tangled up in Ukraine conspiracy theories, GOP members mentioned Joe and Hunter Biden countless times during the impeachment hearings on Ukraine, leaving some Americans confused about the Bidens' ties to the controversy. Clarity in squelching unsubstantiated charges will be key to whether Biden can survive.He was easily provoked Thursday because the retired farmer who confronted him essentially outlined Trump's false accusations against the former vice president.The exchange unfolded at a town hall in New Hampton, Iowa, on Thursday afternoon when Biden's 83-year-old adversary inaccurately accused of the former vice president of arranging a job for his son Hunter at a Ukraine oil company, thereby ""selling access to the presidency,"" and punctuated his charges by asserting Biden was just ""too old"" to be commander in chief.""You're a damn liar man,"" Biden said, addressing the allegation about Hunter with a flash of anger in his eyes. ""That's not true and no one has ever said that.""He answered the man's attack on his age and his mental agility by showing the streak of unvarnished masculinity that has long been part of Biden's public persona.""You want to check my shape -- let's do push-ups together man.  Let's run, let's do whatever you want to do,"" Biden said.The mano-a-mano moment was reminiscent of Biden's exchange during his 1988 campaign with New Hampshire voter Frank Fahey who asked Biden where he went to law school and what his class rank was.""I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship,"" the then-Delaware senator replied. ""I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like."" It also had the red-blooded ring of Biden's challenge to Trump when he said in March 2018 that if he and Trump were in high school ""I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him."" It's an open question how Biden's machismo will go over with suburban women looking to turn the page beyond the patriarchy. And Biden's approach could turn off younger voters and female voters who want to the Democratic Party go in a more progressive direction and build on the gains of the many female leaders at all levels of government who were elected in 2018.  Biden's reaction on Thursday also clearly stemmed from his sensitivity to criticism of his family, a through line throughout his career.After defending his own fitness for the White House, Biden circled back to defend his son, who served on the board of the Ukraine energy company known as Burisma while Biden was vice president. Hunter Biden recently told ABC that he showed ""poor judgment"" by taking the post. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, however.The retired Iowa farmer had pushed back on Biden's denials of helping Hunter Biden by saying he'd seen the arrangement described on TV, adding that he wasn't accusing Biden of anything.""You said I set up my son to work at an oil company. Isn't that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack,"" the former vice president said to the retired farmer. ""You did not hear that at all.""""It looks like you don't have any more backbone than Trump has,"" the man replied, as the rest of the audience groaned. ""I'm not voting for you anyway.""""You think I thought you'd stand up and vote for me,"" Biden snapped. ""You're too old to vote for me."" (Again, probably not the smartest thing to say to a voter -- but authentically ""Joe."")After the event, when reporters asked Biden why he got so frustrated with the retired farmer, the former vice president acknowledged his competing instincts to defend his son or play it cool.""I have overwhelming respect and love for my son. And I find myself occasionally getting frustrated with assertions that have been made -- that are simply not accurate,"" Biden said. ""But as my son would say, 'Dad, just keep your cool, just don't let it get to you.'"" ""What I wanted to do is shut this down,"" Biden said, reflecting on his effort to avoid playing Trump's ""game"" and his realization that the President is most ""comfortable mud wrestling.""""Let's keep our eye on the ball here,"" he said.

CNN to air December PBS Democratic presidential debate live,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/cnn-next-presidential-debate-pbs/index.html," (CNN)CNN will air the Democratic presidential debate live on multiple platforms next month, joining local PBS stations to bring the final Democratic National Committee-sanctioned debate of 2019 to viewers in the US and around the world.PBS NewsHour is partnering with Politico to produce the debate on December 19 from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. At least six Democrats have qualified to participate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Candidates have until December 12 to meet the qualifying criteria established by the Democratic National Committee and its partners to receive an invitation to the debate.The debate comes during tumultuous times in US history, shaped by ongoing presidential impeachment proceedings in Washington, and a country deeply divided along ideological lines. The House impeachment proceedings are expected to continue through December, and if the House impeaches President Donald Trump, the Senate will likely take it up in January. Six of the Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination currently serve as US senators and will need to be in Washington if the Senate convenes a trial. This will make the December debate even more critical as it could be the last time these candidates will have a national stage until the next debate in January.Several Democrats have ended their presidential campaigns after failing to attract enough support from Democratic voters. But the primary field is not contracting. Concerns about the political strength of the current field has triggered at least two more Democrats to consider bids. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced his campaign last week, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has made moves toward an eleventh-hour bid for the party's nomination. It is unclear if Patrick or Bloomberg will reach the DNC thresholds for the December debate. In addition to airing on local PBS stations, the debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com's homepage, PBS.com's home page, and Politico.com's homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV and SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795.The DNC stated last year it plans to convene 12 Democratic debates in the 2019-2020 presidential election cycle -- six in this current year and six next year. CNN's live simulcast of the ""PBS NewsHour & POLITICO Democratic Debate"" will be the third presidential debate CNN has aired this year."
"Pamela Karlan, the professor who took on Trump's party over impeachment",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/pamela-karlan-impeachment-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN)If House Republicans thought a panel of legal experts opining upon the impeachment for eight hours might drag Wednesday, they underestimated Professor Pamela Karlan.  Karlan emerged Wednesday as a new hero for liberal law professors across the country for her ability to joust with House members all the while ticking off why she believes Donald Trump should be impeached, making complicated legal philosophies understandable, and raising the ire of supporters of the President. Her testimony also evoked a rare tweet from first lady Melania Trump castigating her for a comment she made that invoked the Trumps' 13-year-old son, for which Karlan later apologized. Those who know the 60-year-old Stanford Law professor were not surprised by her testimony and said it was vintage Karlan. Over the years as a legal scholar and Supreme Court advocate she has prided herself on her outspokenness, acknowledging that her candor might hurt her in some quarters.  A decade ago Karlan addressed a graduating class at Stanford praising them for their diversity and making some confessions. ""I regret getting frustrated by little things,"" she said. ""I regret never taking the summer off. I regret not being able to stick to a diet."" But Karlan said there were things she didn't regret. ""I don't even regret being kind of snarky,"" she said, before acknowledging that she's paid a price for her directness.  ""Would I like to be on the Supreme Court? You bet I would,"" she told the audience. ""But not enough to have trimmed my sails for half a lifetime."" Karlan, an expert on voting rights and LGBT law among other issues, currently co-directs Stanford Law's Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.  Besides a brief stint serving as deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, she has worked her entire career as a law professor and a scholar for liberal groups. She served as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and as a commissioner on the California Fair Political Practices Commission. She has written casebooks and articles and attended both Yale University and Yale Law school. Friends of Karlan say the hearing overall showcased the talents of a woman devoted to the law and unafraid to speak her mind.   ""She is a brilliant advocate, an honest broker, and an eminent scholar,"" said David Cole, the National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""She knows constitutional law like Steve Jobs knew computers and Sandy Koufax knew pitching,"" he said, adding, ""there are few advocates I would less want to see on the other side of one of my cases."" In October, Karlan's mix of legal chops and quick wit was on display at the Supreme Court when she argued a case concerning whether federal employment law protects LGBT workers. Representing the LGBT individuals behind the lawsuit, she got into a tangle with Justice Samuel Alito, disarming him with a Saturday Night Live reference. Alito was asking a long hypothetical about the difference between discrimination based on sex and discrimination based on sexual orientation. He asked: ""What if the decision-maker makes a decision based on sexual orientation but does not know the biological sex of the person involved?""  Karlan shot back: ""And they are unable to tell anything about the person's sex?"" Alito replied: ""No."" ""So this is Saturday Night Live Pat -- as an example?"" Karlan asked referring to the androgynous fictional character who appeared in SNL skits in the early 1990s. The skits centered over others' inability to determine Pat's sex.  The reference went over Alito's head. ""I don't know about that,"" he said as the room broke up.  Sparring with GOP questionersKarlan, called to testify by Democrats, made clear in her opening statement that she thinks the President should be impeached.  ""Everything I know about our Constitution and its values, and my review of the evidentiary record, tells me that when President Trump invited -- indeed, demanded -- foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this country the 'republic' to which we pled allegiance,"" she said.  The evidence, she added, ""shows a President who did this to strong arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the President's opponents in our ongoing election season."" For Karlan, this was not ""politics as usual"" but instead a ""cardinal reason why the Constitution contains an impeachment power.""  At the start of the hearing, Republican Rep. Doug Collins made the mistake of suggesting that the panel of law professors couldn't ""possibly have digested"" the pertinent witness testimony.  Karlan seized on the comment. ""Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts, so I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts,"" she said.  Later she allowed that she had spent all of Thanksgiving reading transcripts. ""I ate like a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this,"" she said.  She also mixed it up with another Republican, Rep. Matt Gaetz, who cited her political contributions. Karlan noted she had given $1,000 to Elizabeth Warren and $1,200 to Barack Obama.  ""And you gave $2,000 to Hillary Clinton,"" he asked.  ""That is correct,"" she said.  Gaetz asked her why she had given more to Clinton then the other candidates, but Karlan had had enough of the line of questioning about her campaign contributions or preferences. ""Because I've been giving a lot of money to charity recently because of all of the poor people in the United States,"" she said. She later offered a Con Law lesson. ""I should say just one thing, and I apologize for getting a little overheated a moment ago, but I have a constitutional right, under the First Amendment, to give money to candidates. At the same time, we have a constitutional duty to keep foreigners from spending money in our elections. And those two things are two sides of the same coin.""Called out by the White HouseYet she mistepped when trying to make the point that presidents aren't kings. ""So while the President can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron,"" she said.  The comments prompted an impassioned tweet from the first lady. ""A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it,"" Melania Trump wrote. ""Classless move by a Democratic 'witness',"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted. ""Prof Karlan uses a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline,"" she said an added ""And what's worse, It's met by laughter in the hearing room. What is being done to this country is no laughing matter."" Later Karlan apologized: ""If I can just say one thing. I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the President's son, it was wrong of me to do that.""But the professor added a coda to her statement.""I wish the President would apologize obviously for the things that he's done that's wrong,"" she added, ""but I do regret having said that."""
'We've gone this far': Farmers stick with Trump over trade,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/politics/trump-soybean-farmers-trade-aid-payments/index.html,"Washington (CNN)From the very start, President Donald Trump's trade war was painful for American soybean farmers.China's tariffs immediately wiped out what was once their biggest export market, worth $12 billion in 2017. That was more than a year ago. Soybeans have since piled up in bins, sending the amount in storage up 108% in 12 months. The price per bushel has fallen to a 10-year low.The situation looks bleak, and tariffs have hit other crops like corn and wheat, too. Many farmers have expressed frustration, and some have even said they no longer support the President. But farmers, a politically important group for Trump, are staying afloat -- largely thanks to Trump's bailout -- and that's keeping some on board with Trump's trade war.""At this point, we've gone this far, we want to make sure we get a good deal,"" said Iowa farmer Grant Kimberley, who also serves as director of market development at the Iowa Soybean Association.Like many others, Kimberley was able to sell most of his soybeans last year -- but for a lower price. He just finished harvesting his soybeans this year, selling some and putting the rest in storage, waiting to see if prices go up. But with bills to pay, farmers can't hold onto the crop forever.Trump has given about $28 billion -- about double the cost of the 2009 auto bailout -- to farmers hurt by the Chinese tariffs. The payments aren't meant to make up for their total losses, but it's helping bridge the gap. ""We'd rather have trade than aid. But it's been a godsend to have that, otherwise things would look pretty ugly,"" said Kimberley.Years of struggleA recent survey found that farmer sentiment is higher than it has been since 2016 and the US Department of Agriculture projected that farm income will be up 10% this year, to the highest level since 2014. But without government payments, which are expected to be up 64% in 2019, farm income would have actually shrunk. The agricultural sector has been struggling for years. In 2016 farm income, without the subsidies, fell to just half of what it was three years before. Trump's aid payments are a lifeline, but they're not saving everyone. Farm bankruptcies are up 24% compared to the year before, according to the American Farm Bureau. ""The latest round of trade aid to farmers provides critical support,"" said Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall in a statement this week, adding that a ""further delay in reaching an agreement would make it hard for struggling farmers to hold on in the face of rising bankruptcy rates."" Still, some farmers see the bailout as evidence that the President still has their backs. ""I think it's important that the payments do highlight the fact that the administration understands the pressure they're putting on farmers and the rural economy,"" said Illinois farmer Evan Hultine. He decided to take soybeans out of rotation this year to try to avoid some of the trade uncertainty.""We understand that maybe China needs to be brought to task for improper trade tactics and unfair practices, but we're looking at a year-and-half now,"" he added.There's been numerous contradictory signals from both the United States and China about how close they are to reaching a deal. Trump suggested this week that he might wait until after the 2020 election. Pennsylvania farmer Bill Boyd said he supported Trump's trade war originally, when he thought it would be wrapped up in a few months. But now that it's dragged on, he thinks it was a ""bad idea.""""I think he's backstabbing the main people who got him into office in all those Midwest states who help to vote him in,"" Boyd said, but added that it's likely he will vote for Trump again. ""Unless they (Democrats) come up with a better alternative, I am going to vote for him again,"" he said. Will the Chinese market come back?If a China deal was signed tomorrow, Kimberley doesn't expect things to go back to normal for at least a year. The Chinese have started buying more from South America and may continue to do so. But there's hope that at least some of the orders will come back since China buys 60% of the world's traded soybeans. Some farmers are less optimistic than others that a significant part of the Chinese market will return. ""You don't trade with partners that you don't trust, you just don't,"" said Marcy Svenningsen, who grows soybeans, corn and wheat in North Dakota.The low price for soybeans have been painful for Svenningsen, but bad weather has brought on other challenges, resulting in ""one of the worst years"" she's seen. An early snowstorm destroyed some of her soybean crop. A pile of corn is sitting in her backyard because the crop is too wet to sell. And she also can't sell her wheat, which got infected with a disease because of the wet conditions. But she received payouts from her government crop insurance plan for the damaged wheat, as well as aid from the trade mitigation package. She also has a job off the farm, which supplements her family's income. Still, she's holding off on making any equipment purchases, even though some things need to be replaced and expects to lose money this year. ""You know farmers, we just keep plowing ahead every single day. You just do it,"" she said.  CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report."
Biden leads nationally as Buttigieg rises,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/27/politics/cnn-poll-joe-biden-pete-buttigieg/index.html," (CNN)Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time.Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.The findings suggest slight declines in support for Biden and Warren since October, and a modest increase in backing for Buttigieg. Sanders' support remains about the same as it was in October. A majority of potential Democratic voters remain uncertain about their choices. Just 42% say they have definitely decided on their candidates, about the same as in October, and Biden continues to have an edge among that group of committed voters.Asked who they would choose if the race came down to the top four instead of the 18 major candidates currently in the running, the order at the top remains the same. Biden continues to hold a lead -- 35% say they would choose him -- with 23% choosing Sanders, 20% Warren and 17% Buttigieg.Buttigieg's bump in the poll coincides with a well-received debate performance, with 22% who watched or followed news coverage about last week's debate saying he had the best night. Biden lands in second at 16%, Sanders at 10%, Harris and Warren each at 8% and Booker at 5%.Most potential Democratic voters say they prefer a candidate who aims for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if they wouldn't make major changes, over a candidate who aims for policies that would make larger changes (56% feel that way, 36% prefer a candidate who shoots for major change). But when asked which candidate would best handle specific issues, potential Democratic voters are more closely divided between those seeking big changes and those aiming for more incremental progress.On health care, 28% say Sanders -- an advocate of ""Medicare for All"" and the elimination of private health insurance -- would best handle the issue. That's about even with the 26% who choose Biden, who has argued against moving to a completely government-run system. Another 19% say they prefer Warren's approach, which ultimately results in government health coverage for all, while 7% choose Buttigieg, and no other candidate has the backing of more than 3% on the issue.Sanders leads the way more clearly on handling the climate crisis: 27% favor his approach, followed by 21% who prefer Biden and 15% Warren.Biden holds an edge on the economy, though by a narrower margin than he did in October. About 3 in 10 (29%) prefer him on the issue, down from 38% last month, with Warren at 19% and Sanders at 17%. Buttigieg lands at 7% and Yang at 5% on the issue.Biden has lost some ground as most trusted on almost all the issues tested, while Buttigieg has made gains nearly across the board.More potential Democratic voters see Biden as capable of managing the government effectively (86%) than say the same about Sanders (73%), Warren (73%) or Buttigieg (54%). Biden also tops the leading candidates on being able to unite the country rather than divide it (73% say so, vs. 65% for Sanders, 58% for Warren and 54% for Buttigieg).Sanders (66%), Biden (64%) and Warren (61%) are all closely clustered on being able to bring needed change, with Buttigieg a bit behind at 54%.Warren holds a clear advantage on having the stamina and sharpness to be president -- 81% say that describes her, compared with 66% for Buttigieg, 65% for Biden and 58% for Sanders.Sanders' strength is being seen as honest and trustworthy. Nearly 9 in 10 potential Democratic voters (89%) call Sanders honest and trustworthy, vs. 78% for Warren, 75% for Biden and 64% for Buttigieg. That carries through among all adults as well. Overall, 62% see Sanders as honest and trustworthy, making him the only candidate of the top four Democrats plus President Donald Trump who is seen that way by a majority of Americans.All four tested Democratic candidates outpace Trump on two measures: honesty (62% Sanders, 49% Warren, 47% Biden, 45% Buttigieg, 36% Trump) and uniting the country rather than dividing it (47% Biden, 44% Sanders, 37% Warren, 35% Buttigieg, 31% Trump). Trump ties Sanders at the top on being able to bring needed change (43% each, followed by Biden at 40%, Warren at 39%, Buttigieg at 35%). Biden leads the field on managing the government effectively (55% Biden, 46% Sanders, 44% Warren, 42% Trump, 36% Buttigieg). While Warren takes the lead on having the stamina and sharpness for the presidency (54% describe Warren that way, 47% Trump, 46% Buttigieg, 44% Biden and 40% Sanders).One caveat on these figures: A large number (roughly a quarter across attributes) say they are unsure how to answer about Buttigieg. For the other candidates, that number was in the single digits across the board.Health care (46% extremely important) and gun policy (44% extremely important) continue to rank at the top of voters' issue concerns for 2020. The impeachment inquiry into Trump ranks near the bottom, with 27% calling that extremely important. That rises a bit to 39% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, but dips to just 15% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters.The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS November 21 through 24 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among the 431 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, it is plus or minus 5.7 percentage points."
"Graham says he's '1,000% confident' Russia meddled in 2016 US election -- not Ukraine",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/lindsey-graham-russia-election-meddling-ukraine-conspiracy/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on Tuesday said he is ""1,000% confident"" that Russia, not Ukraine, meddled in the 2016 US presidential election, breaking from President Donald Trump and others in his party who have pushed the discredited conspiracy theory.""It was the Russians. I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else,"" the South Carolina senator told reporters on Capitol Hill. He reiterated his stance to CNN saying, ""I've got no doubt that it was the Russians who stole the DNC emails. It wasn't Ukraine. Russia was behind the stolen DNC emails and (John) Podesta and all that good stuff.""Graham continued later in the same interview: ""So as to the Ukraine, they had zero to do with the hacking of the DNC and the stealing of the emails. Whether or not people from the Ukraine met with DNC operatives, I don't know. All I've seen is press reports that no one has validated.""His comments come as the impeachment probe into Trump and Ukraine moves into the next phase. The House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released its report detailing how the President sought political gain through his dealings with Ukraine. The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first impeachment hearing on Wednesday. Graham, a staunch defender of Trump, has criticized the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry. The President and his allies have insisted that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election to help then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. US intelligence officials have told lawmakers that Russia has been engaging in a years-long effort to shift the blame of Moscow's interference in the 2016 US presidential election to Ukraine, a message that was echoed during public testimony by Trump's former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill and other witnesses in the impeachment probe.CNN's Ted Barrett, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report."
"Pennsylvania state rep accused of stealing $500k from her charity for fur coats, vacation and campaign resigns",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/movita-johnson-harrell-corruption-charges-resigning/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)A Pennsylvania state lawmaker said this week that she plans to resign after prosecutors announced a number of corruption charges against her, alleging she used $500,000 from her own charity to fund a slew of personal expenses -- including fur coats, vacations and her campaign. Pennsylvania state Rep. Movita Johnson-Harrell, a Democrat, was charged Wednesday with eight crimes connected to the scandal, including theft, perjury and record tampering. Prosecutors say she spent years siphoning the money from her charity, Motivations Education & Consultation Associates, which was created to ""serve the mentally ill and drug-addicted poor,"" in order to enrich herself. In a letter sent Thursday to Pennsylvania House Speaker Mike Turzai and provided to CNN, Johnson-Harrell said she plans to resign from the body effective December 13 and defend herself against the accusations. ""While I dispute many of the allegations lodged against me, I accept responsibility for some missteps made before I became an elected official,"" she wrote, adding that she will ""survive these charges.""Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement on Wednesday that Johnson-Harrell had turned herself in and ""plans to plead guilty,"" though his office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on about which charges she will admit to or how much time in jail she is facing. ""I've said time and time again as Attorney General that no one is above the law, no matter their position of power. And today is no different,"" Shapiro said in the statement. According to the 11-page criminal complaint, Johnson-Harrell designed an elaborate scheme to illegally transfer money from her non-profit and then cover up the transfers and her spending by misrepresenting her finances on official documents. Prosecutors laid out a litany of examples of how she did so, saying her scheme took place between 2015 and 2019. In one example from 2017, Johnson-Harrell allegedly ""made out a MECA check to 'Cash' for $3,150 and deposited it into her personal bank account,"" which at the time had only $67 in it.Less than two days later, prosecutors say she ""spent $840.06 at a designer clothing website she frequented and bought an airline ticket for $292.40.""In another case, the transfer of $5,000 of MECA funds was allegedly used by Johnson-Harrell to pay for nearly $4,000 in tuition for her grandchildren's private school and nearly $3,000 to make purchases from ""Tradesy, another designer woman's clothing and accessories website, as well as Ralph Lauren and Macy's."" In total, Johnson-Harrell spent almost $15,000 of MECA funds on clothing, including fox fur coats, and $16,000 of the charity's funds on ""pleasure"" trips to Mexico, Orlando, Florida, and Ocean City, Maryland,"" according to prosecutors.  The embattled lawmaker also funded her campaign ""with a series of checks that illegally moved money directly from her charity to her campaign fund, 'Friends of Movita,'"" according to the complaint, which says she concealed the truth about the money from her campaign's treasurer in order to cover up the wrongdoing. The document details how Johnson-Harrell allegedly lied on official financial documents to cover up her scheme, in some cases filing ""erroneous Statement of Financial Interest failing to disclose her income,"" while on others she ""failed to properly report"" campaign expenses to the state. Johnson-Harrell's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Friday. In a joint statement to CNN, House Speaker Mike Turzai and House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler said they ""appreciate"" Johnson-Harrell's resignation and that they're ""deeply concerned anytime someone entrusted with a position of public leadership is accused of crimes that impugn the integrity of elected office.""The first female Muslim lawmaker elected in the state, Johnson-Harrell made headlines earlier this year when a controversial prayer given by another lawmaker during her swearing-in was called religiously exclusive and political. At the time, Johnson-Harrell said the lawmaker, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz, should be censured for her prayer and called for inclusion among the members."
Calls between Giuliani and White House budget office in doubt,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/white-house-omb-giuliani-phone-calls/index.html," (CNN)Rudy Giuliani's phone calls with a number that House investigators say is associated with the White House's budget office may have simply been calls to and from the White House, according to information obtained by CNN.CNN has learned that the number the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report said was ""associated"" with the Office of Management and Budget is a number that could go to multiple officials within the White House complex, including the White House itself. Real Clear Politics was first to report on the phone number issue.The new details cast doubt on whether Giuliani was talking to the Office of Management and Budget in the spring, a critical time in which the ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was facing a barrage of now-discredited rumors that she wasn't loyal enough to the President. The calls, in April 2019, were well before any known action by the White House to hold Ukrainian military aid, raising questions as to whether there were discussions earlier than previously known.   The OMB designation appears again, according to the report, in calls with Giuliani on August 8, when US military aid to Ukraine had already been held back. The Intelligence Committee's report states that ""Giuliani had three phone calls with a number associated with OMB"" on April 24. And, the report detailed that in August, Giuliani had a call with a number associated with OMB for 13 minutes.""The Committees were unable to identify the official associated with the phone number. In the mid-afternoon, someone using a telephone number associated with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) called Mr. Giuliani, and the call lasted for nearly 13 minutes. Mr. Giuliani called the OMB number and the White House Situation Room several more times that evening, but each time connected for only a few seconds or not at all,"" the report stated.The new information does not cast doubt that Giuliani had calls with the White House, only whether those calls were specifically with the Office of Management and Budget. After the House Intelligence Committee published their report, one senior committee official told CNN that a number that had been associated with the Office of Management and Budget in the report had been ""based on public directories,"" but that they are ""continuing to investigate these call records as part of our ongoing work, including to assess whether that number, associated with OMB landlines, may also indicate calls received from elsewhere within the White House. """"The White House does not contest that these calls with Giuliani originated within the White House, thereby confirming that Giuliani was in fact in frequent contact with individuals within the White House at key points during the scheme. For his part, Mr. Giuliani has now confirmed speaking to Mick Mulvaney, who continues to serve as both the head of OMB and Acting Chief of Staff in the White House,"" the House Intel committee official said in a statement. After the call logs emerged Tuesday in the Intelligence Committee's report, questions arose about why Giuliani was speaking with someone at OMB.  A spokesperson for OMB told CNN that no one from the agency was ever in contact with Giuliani.One possibility was that the phone was connected to Mulvaney, who still held his position at OMB. A White House official told CNN on Wednesday that Mulvaney and Giuliani had not discussed Ukraine and Mulvaney's call records never showed he spoke to the President's personal attorney by phone on the dates listed in the report.Giuliani also said he wasn't involved in withholding the aid to Ukraine and that he never discussed the issue on any call to OMB.""(I) don't remember calling OMB and not about military aid never knew anything about it,"" he told CNN via text on Wednesday.The call log still reveals Giuliani was in regular contact with the White House at a time that House intelligence investigators say was critical to the withholding of US military aid.The discrepancy comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday she asked her committee chairmen to move forward with articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing Monday in which lawyers will present the evidence from the Intelligence Committee's report. The call logs could become a target for Republicans in the hearing.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the date on which the Intelligence Committee's report said Giuliani had three phone calls with a number associated with the Office of Management and Budget."
Giuliani's calls with mysterious '-1' raise more questions for House Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/giuliani-phone-call-records-mystery/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)Phone records released this week as part of the House Democrats' impeachment report revealed a series of calls from President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to an ""unidentified"" number designated simply as ""-1"" that has investigators wondering who it is. The phone company logs, according to the report, also show Giuliani made several calls to numbers associated with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget during that same time frame, further fueling speculation about who he was talking to and for what purpose. While the substance of these conversations remains unclear, phone records reveal a flurry of calls involving Giuliani in April that could be relevant in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine, according to the report by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. The calls also came at a time when Giuliani was helping deal with the fallout from special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after a redacted version was released that same month, one White House official noted Wednesday.Now, months after they took place, those calls are at the center of a mystery that could have significant implications on the impeachment process. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff was quick to imply that Trump himself is connected to the ""-1"" listing, despite telling CNN's Anderson Cooper that his panel is still investigating the identity of the individual. ""Rudy Giuliani only had one client -- and that was Donald Trump,"" the California Democrat said.But several members on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN that they did not know whether the numbers were traced to various individuals or who ""-1"" was. Trump's acting chief of staff and OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, immediately emerged as a possible source of the OMB calls due to his role in helping facilitate the hold on aid to Ukraine and influence at the agency despite transitioning to the White House last December.A spokesperson for OMB told CNN that no one from the agency was ever in contact with Giuliani, despite what's shown on the logs in the report.A White House official told CNN that Mulvaney and Giuliani have not discussed Ukraine and Mulvaney's call records show he did not speak to the President's personal attorney by phone on the dates listed in the report. Giuliani also insists that he was not involved in withholding the aid to Ukraine and that he never discussed the issue on any call to OMB.""(I) don't remember calling OMB and not about military aid never knew anything about it,"" he told CNN via text on Wednesday. Concerns about Giuliani Amid all the uncertainty related to these calls, the release of the records has already raised additional concerns about Giuliani. Some close to the President and his campaign believe Giuliani has become a ""liability"" for the President, two sources told CNN on Tuesday. A Trump campaign source reacted to the findings from House Intelligence Committee, including the calls with White House and OMB officials, with a finger pointed squarely at Giuliani, saying: ""Rudy should be worried.""However, Trump has not publicly wavered in his support for Giuliani, and despite the lingering questions, he is still part of the President's legal team.Still, the call records involving Giuliani and ""-1"" are of particular interest. House Democrats who have cast the call records as a paper trail detailing Giuliani's coordination with top administration officials, and potentially even the President himself, in his dealings with Ukraine that are central to the impeachment probe. The committee's impeachment inquiry report shows Giuliani speaking a number of times with that individual during several key moments detailed in the document.House investigators obtained the records from Verizon and AT&T, which is the parent company of CNN, but the logs included in the House report only provide details related to the length of the call and its participants.  ""We can't confirm yet who the number belongs to,"" Schiff told CNN Tuesday. ""We are certainly investigating that,"" he added, noting that the phone number ""-1"" also came up during the trial of former Trump adviser Roger Stone.Prosecutors showed evidence at Stone's trial that he took a call coming from a ""-1""number in August 2016, and a government witness' testimony implied it could have come from Trump.That call occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign before Trump entered the White House and witnesses offered no explanation as to where the ""-1"" designation came from or if it was unique to Trump himself.   A source told CNN that the ""-1"" listing may only show up on call logs, not on caller ID from the White House, meaning the recipient could see ""202"" or ""unknown"" on caller ID but the call could show up as ""-1"" on phone company call logs.

"Democrat announces retirement, says Russia probe and impeachment inquiry 'have rendered my soul weary'",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/denny-heck-retirement-congress-impeachment/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Democratic Rep. Denny Heck of Washington state announced his retirement on Wednesday, saying in an announcement that ""the countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary."" In his role on the Intelligence Committee, Heck has been in the spotlight during the high-profile public hearings with current and former administration officials as part of the House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine scandal.""The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,"" Heck said in a post on Medium. ""I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President's unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.""Heck has represented Washington's 10th congressional district since 2013 on Capitol Hill and previously served in the Washington state legislature. The Democratic lawmaker serves on the House financial services and intelligence committees.""With the bulk of the Intelligence Committee's work on impeachment behind us, Thanksgiving week provided me with a good opportunity for rest and reflection,"" Heck wrote in the post. Reflecting on his tenure in Congress, the lawmaker went on to say, ""It is incredible work but it takes its toll. Being away so much from Paula, my best friend and wife of nearly 44 years, can be lonely even when I am in a crowded room. At our age, however many 'good years' we have left together is not a growing number.""Heck added later, however, that ""none of this discouragement in any way diminishes the bone-deep gratitude I feel for the privilege to serve in Congress and for all who have made this incredible journey possible -- my family, the voters of the 10th District, my staff and all the countless people who have extended a thousand kindnesses along the way. So, in less it hasn't been clear enough: Thank you! But it is time for me to retire."""
DOJ quietly posts internal legal opinions about immunity from congressional testimony,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/doj-legal-opinions-immunity-congressional-testimony/index.html,"Eight of the opinions appear to bolster the White House's stonewalling of Congress on witness testimony and document subpoenas. The opinions date back to the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon faced impeachment, and the early 1980s. One from 1982 was written by the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the request of Rudy Giuliani, who at the time worked within the Justice Department.Some of the opinions appear to have been made public before, and some have only been cited by the Justice Department in other legal arguments. Those released Thursday hadn't all been collected before on the Justice Department's central website regarding its internal legal opinions.   A Justice Department official acknowledging the releases said these opinions were cited in the Office of Legal Counsel's more recent opinion that former Trump White House counsel Don MGahn should be immune from subpoenaed congressional testimony. The House has sued for McGahn to testify, winning at the trial court stage, and the Justice Department is appealing. The newly released opinions were requested by the House as part of the McGahn lawsuit, according to the official.The collection could be a valuable central resource for the President in the coming weeks, fleshing out the authority the executive branch has given itself to ignore congressional requests.Then-head of the Office of Legal Counsel Ted Olson wrote in July 1982 that the White House counsel should not submit to a subpoena or request to testify to the Senate, arguing the president's ""close advisors are an extension of the President."" Just as he cannot ""compel congressmen to appear before him,"" Congress ""may not compel him to appear before it,"" Olson wrote. Notably, Olson told the deputy attorney general that if the president broke with precedent and submitted to such testimony it would be seen by ""many -- including members of Congress who are aware of the historical practice -- as a sign of weakness.""A second memo dated six days earlier from Olson to Giuliani lays out arguments for why a presidential adviser should not testify, including because of executive privilege. Olson warns, ""The danger is great, therefore, that agreeing to this particular Congressional demand to depose one of the highest and most intimate of Presidential advisers will erode a central foundation of executive privilege and severely chill internal deliberations among Executive Branch advisers in the future.""Other early opinions republished Thursday also tout the autonomy of the executive branch, and were written by notable other former Office of Legal Counsel chiefs within Justice, including William Rehnquist, who became the US chief justice and oversaw the impeachment and trial of President Bill Clinton. ""It is vital that a recommendation that the President assert privilege be a considered one, because the consequences of initially asserting the claim and then receding from it in the face of public criticism are obviously more hurtful than an initial decision not to assert the claim,"" Rehnquist wrote in 1971.The Office of Legal Counsel writes binding opinions for the executive branch, but they do not always withstand scrutiny in federal courts.Currently, appeals courts are weighing the White House's assertions of absolute immunity over its current and former officials and the House's subpoena power.

Supreme Court puts temporary hold on House subpoenas to banks for Trump's financial documents,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/trump-supreme-court-financial-documents-house-subpoena/index.html," (CNN)Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday put a temporary hold on House subpoenas requesting President Donald Trump's financial documents from two banks. In a brief order, Ginsburg said a lower court opinion that allowed the subpoenas to proceed would go on hold until December 13.Earlier in the day, Trump had asked the justices to freeze the subpoenas to give his personal lawyers more time to ask the Supreme Court to take up his appeal.Ginsburg, who has jurisdiction over the lower court, likely acted to give her colleagues more time to consider Trump's request. She also instructed the House to respond to Trump's petition by Wednesday.Lawyers for Trump told the justices that the subpoenas are ""extraordinarily broad"" and that they raise ""profound separation-of-powers concerns.""In all, three separate cases pertaining to Trump's records -- two of which concern House subpoenas -- are before the justices. Ginsburg's order signals that all of the petitions could be considered by the court December 13 during its regularly scheduled closed-door conference. No documents are expected to be released until the Supreme Court acts.The cases are at different stages and it is unclear how soon the court might issue an order or agree to take up one of the challenges.The justices are in the middle of a blockbuster term considering cases on abortion, the Second Amendment, immigration and LGBT rights. If the court is going to add a case concerning Trump's records to the docket this term, it would likely have to act by mid-January.The latest case concerns subpoenas that the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One asking for a variety of documents from the President, members of his family, the Trump Organization and several affiliated entities. Trump's lawyers are seeking to block the subpoenas from going forward, to give the President time to formally ask the justices to take up his appeal.A federal appeals court allowed the subpoenas for most of the documents to go forward earlier in the week, but agreed to put the ruling on a seven-day hold so that Trump could ask the Supreme Court to step in.""Unquestionably, disclosure of the financial records sought by the Committees will subject [Trump's] private business affairs to the Committees' scrutiny,"" the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals held on Tuesday, ""however, inquiry into private affairs is not always beyond the investigative power of Congress.""The court said the ""interests of Congress in pursuing the investigations for which the challenged subpoenas were issued substantially overbalance the privacy interests"" of the President.The ruling was the latest loss that Trump has sustained in court. Other courts have ruled against him in cases concerning a House subpoena to his longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, as well as a subpoena from a New York grand jury.In the latest petition, lawyers for Trump argue that the Supreme Court should treat him differently from ordinary plaintiffs and agree to the emergency petition because he is entitled to the ""high degree of respect due the President of the United States."" They argue that in issuing the subpoenas, Congress exceeded its legislative authority by improperly engaging in law enforcement. These ""dragnet"" subpoenas, the lawyers argued, ""look nothing like a legislative inquiry.""This story has been updated."
CNN Poll: No change in views on impeachment after public hearings,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/politics/cnn-poll-impeachment-views/index.html," (CNN)After five days of public hearings in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, public opinion over whether the President ought to be impeached and removed from office remains exactly the same as it was in October, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.Half of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 43% say he should not. Neither figure has changed since October, with support for impeachment remaining at its highest level thus far in CNN polling. The partisan divide over the President persists as well, with roughly 80 points between Democratic support for Trump's removal and Republican support for it. Independents are closely divided on the question, 47% in favor, 45% opposed. Opinions on both sides are deeply held, with about 9 in 10 on either side saying they feel strongly in favor or against it.FULL POLL RESULTSThe President's approval rating has also held about even since October: 42% say they approve, 54% disapprove.Although views on impeachment and removal have not moved, the poll finds that 53% say Trump improperly used his office to gain political advantage, up from 49% who said the same in October. More, 56%, say the President's efforts to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Biden family, a Ukrainian energy company and the 2016 election were more to benefit himself politically than to fight Ukrainian corruption.The public is about evenly divided over whether there is enough evidence now for the House to vote to impeach the President and send him to trial before the Senate (48% say yes, 47% say no). And a narrow majority (52%) say the Democrats have exercised their constitutional powers properly during the impeachment inquiry, 40% say they have abused their constitutional powers.A third of Americans say the Republicans in Congress are doing too much to defend Trump (33%), while 17% say they are doing too little and 41% say they're doing the right amount to defend Trump. Among Republicans, 64% call the effort about right and 24% say they're not going far enough to defend the President.About 4 in 10 say they are following the proceedings ""very closely,"" and among that group, support for impeachment and removal (53% say yes, 46% say no) is a bit higher than it is overall. This more-attentive group is also more likely to say that there is enough evidence now for the House to vote to send the case to trial before the Senate (52% say yes, 48% no). But they are no more likely than the overall public to believe that Trump improperly used his office (52%) or pushed Ukraine to launch investigations in order to benefit himself politically (54%).Even as overall numbers on impeachment and presidential approval hold steady, the poll suggests a growing gender gap, with women increasingly negative in their assessment of Trump. There is now a 20-point difference between men and women on Trump's overall approval rating (52% of men approve vs. 32% of women), the fifth time the divide has been that large in CNN's polling during Trump's presidency. And the poll marks the first time that more than 60% of women have said they backed impeaching Trump and removing him from office (61% say so now, compared with 56% in October and 51% in May), even as a majority of men remain opposed to impeachment (53% oppose it).The President's approval rating for handling the economy rose in this poll to 55%, his best mark since April of this year. That increase has come via a steady climb among independents: In September, 46% approved of his handling of the economy, that rose to 53% in October and stands at 57% now. At the same time, disapproval of the President's handling of foreign affairs has dipped from 59% to 55%. On immigration (39% approve, 58% disapprove) and foreign trade (42% approve, 52% disapprove) there has been little recent change. Trump's approval rating for handling the federal budget is underwater, with 50% disapproving and 37% approving.The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS November 21 through 24 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points."
Trump to meet with Russian foreign minister,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/donald-trump-sergei-lavrov-meeting/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)President Donald Trump is planning to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday in Washington, an encounter that is sure to draw significant scrutiny amid several ongoing controversies involving Trump and Russia.Trump will meet with Lavrov alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the state of their bilateral relationship, a senior administration official told CNN. The State Department had previously announced that Lavrov would travel to Washington this week for meetings with Pompeo to ""discuss a broad range of regional and bilateral issues.""CNN reported earlier Monday that Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Lavrov and Trump would meet.Lavrov's last official visit to Washington in May 2017 was notable because Trump reportedly shared highly classified information in the Oval Office with the foreign minister and then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.This week's meeting will take place amid the backdrop of Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry, which centers on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine -- at a time when it has been fighting Russian aggression -- in exchange for political dirt to aid his reelection bid. And on Monday, a highly anticipated report into the early days of the Russia investigation is set to be released.Trump has striven to improve relations between Washington and Moscow during his time in office, but he's often been pushed to punish the Russian government for conducting destabilizing actions around the world. In August, Trump imposed long-overdue, legally mandated sanctions on Russia for its poisoning of an ex-spy in the United Kingdom.Lavrov, in turn, also has accused the US of destabilizing the world, airing a list of grievances during a press conference last year over the Trump administration's foreign policy, particularly in regard to Iran and North Korea.CNN's Zachary Cohen, Emma Burrows, Angela Dewan and Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.

Republicans' witness says he's received threats since impeachment hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/jonathan-turley-impeachment-expert-congress/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley says his testimony Wednesday against impeaching President Donald Trump has led to a barrage of threats against him. Turley, a law professor with nearly 30 years of teaching experience under his belt at George Washington University, was one of four scholars called before the House Judiciary Committee to provide insight into the complicated and rare constitutional maneuvering. Turley was called by the committee's Republicans. The other three witnesses -- all called by the committee's Democrats -- spoke out in favor of Trump's impeachment while Turley, who was also an expert witness during Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings, leaned on his previous testimony in the 1990s to explain his opposition to it. ""Before I finished my testimony, my home and office were inundated with threatening messages and demands that I be fired from George Washington University for arguing that, while a case for impeachment can be made, it has not been made on this record,"" Turley wrote in an op-ed published Thursday in The Hill. Impeachment case 'has left doubts in the minds of people'In his opening statement, Turley referred to his previous testimony, saying he ""never thought that I would have to appear a second time to address the same question with regard to another sitting president."" ""Yet, here we are,"" he added. He continued: ""Today, my only concern is the integrity and coherence of the constitutional standard and process of impeachment. President Trump will not be our last president and what we leave in the wake of this scandal will shape our democracy for generations to come. I am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger."" RELATED: How constitutional scholars talk when they talk about the ConstitutionDuring his testimony, Turley consistently pointed to his worries about the speed and scope of the impeachment inquiry, saying, ""Fast and narrow is not a good recipe."" He also argued that the record against Trump is ""one of the thinnest records ever to go forward on impeachment"" and that it ""has left doubts in the minds of people"" about what happened.""There's a difference between requesting investigations and a quid pro quo. You need to stick the landing on the quid pro quo,"" he said, referring to some Democrats' charge that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country announcing investigations that would benefit him politically. ""I agree with my colleagues. We've all read the record and I've just come to a different conclusion. I don't see proof of a quid pro quo no matter what my presumptions, assumptions or bias might be."" But Turley's involvement in Clinton's impeachment proceedings may have weakened his testimony, as his comments in 1998 about the danger of not impeaching a president because it cedes too much power to the presidency did not square well Wednesday, when he seemed to take the opposite view: that impeachment itself created the bad precedent.Turley did not respond on Thursday to questions from CNN about his testimony, instead referring to a blog post that dismissed reports saying his Clinton and Trump testimonies contradict one another. ""In fact, the testimony is so close that I could be charged more with self-plagiarism than self-contradiction,"" he wrote.In a separate blog post, Turley said his testimony was meant to encourage additional investigation, not to stop the inquiry altogether.""It is an ironic moment. President Donald Trump wants a fast impeachment. I do not blame him,"" Turley wrote. ""He, and I believe the Democratic leadership, he knows that this will easily collapse. I encouraged that the case be strengthened to address deficiencies.""I do have an opinion and offered an extensive analysis to support it. That is my opinion with which many can honest disagree,"" he added. ""However, these attacks are more evidence of the 'passions' that have out-stripped the proof in this controversy.""A constitutional scholarTurley's 53-page written testimony was filled with analysis on the impeachment proceedings against Presidents Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon, as well as Clinton, demonstrating his academic prowess on the issue with its more than 100 citations. The lengthy piece of writing comes as no surprise considering Turley, who has worked as a legal analyst for NBC and CBS, has authored more than 400 articles on legal and policy issues, according to his biography. During his testimony, he said he's represented a number of notable clients, including former US attorneys general ""during the Clinton impeachment litigation over privilege disputes triggered by the investigation of Independent Counsel Ken Starr."" Additionally, Turley served in 2010 as the lead defense counsel for former federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous, whose Senate trial ended in his removal from the bench. He noted that the House manager in that case was California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who is now leading the impeachment charge against Trump as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. And while he opposes the impeachment proceeding, Turley was also clear during the hearing where his positions on both the President and the executive branch stand, saying he's ""not a supporter"" of Trump and that he ""voted against him in 2016."" He continued: ""I tend to favor Congress in disputes with the Executive Branch and I have been critical of the sweeping claims of presidential power and privileges made by modern Administrations."" Turley, who first began at George Washington University in 1990, ""and in 1998, became the youngest chaired professor in the school's history,"" holds a law degree from Northwestern University and completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, according to his biography.

New poll shows likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers divided on health care,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/politics/cnn-iowa-poll-health-care/index.html," (CNN)A CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa finds that a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers would prefer a health care option that isn't ""Medicare for All."" About a third (36%) want Medicare for All while another third (34%) want to create a public option for buy in and 20% would prefer to restore lost provisions from the Affordable Care Act and work incrementally from there. RELATED: Full poll resultsTogether, a majority (54%) would prefer an option that isn't Medicare for All, while only 36% prefer the more liberal alternative.Likely attendees of the Democratic caucus who support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as their first choice are more likely to support Medicare for All than supporters of other candidates (77% and 68% want Medicare respectively). Likely caucusers for former Vice President Joe Biden or South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are more interested in a public option (42% and 48% each). But if you add the reclamation of the ACA back in, 72% of Buttigieg supporters and 71% of Biden supporters want something other than Medicare for All. Likely caucusgoers who identify as very liberal are more likely to prefer implementing Medicare for All (71%) while moderates lean towards the public option (47%). Likely Democratic caucugoers ages 65 and over are the most interested in restoring the lost ACA provisions through incremental work (34%), though they are still split between restoring Obamacare provisions and creating a public option (35%). The discussion around whether to implement Medicare for All has divided the Democratic primary, with the more liberal candidates standing behind the option that would make health care entirely government run and more moderate Democrats advocating for a program that would allow Americans to buy into the public option, but keep their private health care. Around three-in-five say they understand the current Medicare system well, including 29% very well, while 35% say they understand it just somewhat well or really don't know. Older likely Democratic caucusgoers are more likely to say they understand their current Medicare system than the younger ones -- 38% of those 65 and older say they understand it very well compared to 19% of those 35 years old and younger. Those who say they're extremely enthusiastic about their vote for president in the caucus also seem to be well-informed -- 37% say they understand the current Medicare system very well.The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, November 8 through 13 among a random sample of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer.

Exclusive: Pompeo had off-the-books meeting with Republican donors in London this week,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/pompeo-secret-donor-meeting/index.html," (CNN)Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended an off-the-books sit-down meeting with a conservative group that included a small number of wealthy Republican donors, which was not on his official schedule while he was in London to attend this week's NATO Summit.The gathering, hosted by the Hamilton Society, conveniently took place in the hotel where Pompeo was staying, situated in a small events space on the second floor. Pompeo slipped into the meeting, without the State Department alerting the press traveling with him about where he was headed or who he was going to meet.CNN reviewed a copy of the meeting invitation and spoke to multiple people who attended. The Hamilton Society is a group of right-leaning American and British business professionals who often invite guest speakers to meet them. The news that he made time to meet with the donors after a busy day visiting with world leaders only serves to heighten speculation that Pompeo may be eyeing a run for the Senate in Kansas next year and as he has become further embroiled in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.The few dozen attendees had to leave their cellphones outside of the room for the evening, to ensure that nothing Pompeo said would be recorded, two attendees said. Though they made clear that Pompeo had no reason to believe he was walking into a contentious conversation.""Everyone is right of center, so it was a safe space,"" said one attendee. Pompeo was ""very chatty, casual, and entertaining,"" the attendee said. He also showed off his witty side, a welcome surprise to the small crowd. The topic of Pompeo's possible political ambitions did not come up on Monday night but everyone was talking about them after he departed, explained one attendee.Pompeo arrived at the meeting just in time for dessert and stayed for over an hour, according to the two attendees. Pompeo had spent the early part of the evening at receptions with world leaders at Buckingham Palace and Lancaster House.The State Department did not reply to a request for comment on Pompeo's visit with the Hamilton Society. President Donald Trump also made time to attend a political event when he was in the British capital, but his was on the official White House schedule.The White House billed the fundraiser, which was closed to the press, as ""a roundtable with supporters"" and a Republican source familiar with the event's plans tells CNN that the fundraiser was hosted by Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee run by the Republican National Committee and Trump's campaign.A Trump campaign official said the event was expected to raise $3 million.On Wednesday morning Pompeo was back to his formal diplomatic duties -- setting off for Portugal and Morocco.Impeachment report implicated PompeoWhile he was overseas, the House Intelligence Committee produced their impeachment report suggesting Pompeo was involved in an effort to extract information from Ukraine which would politically benefit Trump. Pompeo, who has called the impeachment inquiry Washington chatter, rejected the accusations on Thursday.""I'll answer only this, it's just all wrong,"" Pompeo said without elaborating further.Pompeo has maintained his existing ties to the Republican Party -- and its donors -- while he has been secretary of state. He has also made new inroads, meeting with well-known GOP donors in New York City who he did not have ties to before becoming Trump's top diplomat and making time to keep a close relationship to the Koch network which he established in Kansas.Last month Trump signaled, for the first time, that he would give Pompeo an opportunity to dash back to Kansas if it benefited the Republican party. He reiterated that sentiment in London.""He's a tremendous guy, doing a tremendous job,"" Trump said. ""You can never find anybody that can do a better job as secretary of state, but if we thought we were going to lose that, I would have a talk with Mike.""Pompeo has long maintained that he will stay in his job as long at Trump wants him to. Just this week, sitting alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who has said he wants Pompeo to jump into the race, Pompeo called reports that he is preparing to make a run ""completely false.""Reverse on Russian meddlingAs he courts his party, Pompeo has reversed his stance on Russian meddling in the 2016 election, embracing the President's position and putting him more in tune with the Republican politics.Last week Pompeo leaned into the debunked theory promoted by Trump that Ukraine interfered in the election. ""Any time there is information that indicates that any country has messed with American elections we not only have a right but a duty to make sure we chase that down,"" Pompeo told reporters.Unlike Fiona Hill -- Trump's former top Russia expert on the National Security Council who testified before Congress last month calling the Ukraine theory a ""fictional narrative"" -- Pompeo chose not to shut down the debunked theory, or close the door on any politically motivated investigationsHe took a very different stance in 2017 as CIA director, making an unequivocal declaration that Russia was to blame for hacking Democratic National Committee emails.""In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence—the GRU—had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee,"" he told a crowd during a speech in Washington.In 2018 Pompeo went as far as to say that Trump had a ""complete and proper"" understanding of what Russia did in 2016, and claimed Trump was in agreement with the intelligence community.""President Trump has stated that he accepts our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election,"" Pompeo told lawmakers during a hearing in 2018. ""I know, I briefed him on it for over a year.""CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report."
"Intelligence agencies have tracked Iranian short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq, US official says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/iran-threat-us-forces-middle-east/index.html,"Washington (CNN)US intelligence agencies and the Pentagon in recent weeks have tracked the movement of a number of Iranian short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq, a US official with direct knowledge of the situation said. While some of the missiles may be categorized as ballistic, the official emphasized that they are very short range, without offering more details.The concern is the missiles could now be moved into areas where they could be fired at US troops by Iranian-backed militias. Senior US military officials, however, have said recently that they don't believe the regime in Tehran is likely to go to war against the US.In a related development, the official said that in the last month these militias have stepped up attacks against US positions with larger rockets than had been seen before. The New York Times was first to report the movement of missiles into Iraq. News of the movement of Iranian missiles into Iraq comes a day after CNN reported there is fresh intelligence of a potential Iranian threat against US forces and interests in the Middle East, according to several US defense and administration officials.""There has been consistent intelligence in the last several weeks,"" one administration official told CNN. A second official described it as information that has been gathered throughout November. The information is being gathered by military and intelligence agencies.The officials would not say in what format the intelligence exists. But in the last several weeks there has been movement of Iranian forces and weapons that the US worries could be put in place for a potential attack, if one is ordered by the Iranian regime, the officials said. It's not clear if a potential threat would come from the central government or Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.The head of US military operations in the Middle East recently signaled the US expects some kind of Iranian action in response to the US sanctions and pressure campaign that is trying to get the regime to abandon its nuclear program.""I would expect that if we look at the past three or four months, it's possible they will do something that is irresponsible. It's possible that they'll lash out at their neighbors,"" Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of the US Central Command, told an audience in Bahrain at the time. ""It is not going to be productive for them in the long term to choose to act out in the military domain. That's the message that we're trying to convey.""Officials were adamant the intelligence has been gathered solely as part of the continuous monitoring by the US and has nothing to do with President Donald Trump's political concerns over the impeachment inquiry. The intelligence has moved through professional military and intelligence channels, and it is not clear whether Trump has yet been briefed on it in detail.CNN's Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report."
Senate Republicans come around to idea of not having witnesses in impeachment trial,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/politics/impeachment-trial-witnesses-senate-republicans/index.html,"The layout of the Senate trial is still under deliberation and leaders have been clear that no final decisions about strategy or structure have been made, but in interviews over the last several days, GOP senators say they are beginning to see the benefit of keeping the process short, leaving out witnesses and instead, simply laying out the facts with a presentation from House managers and the White House.""I would think the consensus would be let the House make their case, let the Senate make their case and then put forward a motion to vote,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican.That marks a shift from a few weeks ago when a number of Republican senators made clear they would go to great lengths to ensure that voters couldn't accuse them of cutting the process short. It was a position that tracked with the Trump White House, which has said publicly, and repeatedly, it wants to hear live testimony from individuals including Hunter Biden and the whistleblower.As the House moves swiftly to a floor vote on impeachment, senators must grapple with what now looks inevitable: that they will act as a jury in a historic impeachment trial.Many questions remain unanswered, however, about how exactly such a trial would proceed. The decision of whether or not to call witnesses could have a significant impact on the way the process unfolds. A Republican senator granted anonymity to speak candidly about concerns within the GOP conference said that the President's desire to have a long trial with many witnesses could backfire.  The senator warned that for every witness called by the President's defense team who might testify in favor of the President, there could be another witness called by Democrats whose testimony could hurt him. The senator specifically pointed to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former Trump national security adviser John Bolton as witnesses Democrats might try to hear from if Republicans call in Hunter or Joe Biden, the whistleblower or others. The senator said the President's ""urge for vindication"" is understandable but ""witnesses cut both ways. We wouldn't be the only ones who would be able to call witnesses.""'A pretty messy and unproductive process'One Republican senator who has spoken to the President about the issue made clear that no strategic decisions would be made without the White House sign off, but said it wasn't impossible that the White House would sign off on the shorter trial. As to Trump's view on the matter, the senator said only: ""It depends on when you catch him.""  A shorter trial is a position that tracks with the message Republicans senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have privately conveyed to the White House over the last several weeks, according to several Republican senators familiar with the conversations. The structure and rules of a potential trial have also been the subject of closed-door Senate GOP lunches for several weeks. More and more the view in the conference has started to shift, underscoring the desire to both avoid a messy process and clear the Senate floor for the chamber to work on other issues. ""Extending this for weeks on end and having lots of votes on motions to call witnesses, doesn't seem to me to be a good use of the Senate's time,"" Sen. John Thune, the second-ranked Republican in the chamber, told CNN..Still, Republicans acknowledge nothing is settled or has even been fully debated at this point internally. The sheer number of unknowns -- including whether McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer can reach agreement on the structure of a trial and what that agreement, if reached, would entail -- make any firm conclusions about what's coming next an impossibility. But after watching the House impeachment inquiry play out, the thinking is that calling witnesses would quickly devolve into a messy, contentious battle that would reveal intra-party schisms and eat up precious floor time in an election year. For Republicans who hail from swing states, a drawn-out debate that forces them to decide whether to call the whistleblower or Hunter Biden to the Senate floor, could have political costs on either side. Voting against the President's wishes could cost them base turnout and a critical Presidential tweet. Voting to call people like the whistleblower or Biden could cost them independents.""I think people are starting to realize that that would be a pretty messy and unproductive process,"" Johnson said of the idea of bringing in witnesses.'I am not in the camp of calling a bunch of witnesses'Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, on Wednesday appeared to throw cold water on the idea of calling a large number of witnesses during a Senate trial.""There are people wanting to call (Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo, they want to call (Vice President Mike) Pence, they want to call Joe Biden, they want to call Hunter Biden. I am not in the camp of calling a bunch of witnesses, but that's just me,"" Graham told reporters. ""I am in the camp of basing my decision based on the record prepared in the House.""""I think as an American, the best thing we can do is deep six this thing,"" Graham added. ""Take the record that was prepared in the House and base an impeachment vote on if they get enough votes, use that same record to decide guilty or innocent, not call a bunch of people, you know that people dream of hearing from, like Pence, Pompeo, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. There's a way to deal with that outside of impeachment.""GOP Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana predicted a Senate trial could be as short as 10 days and as long as four weeks. ""My opinion would be the shortest you move through this is 10 days to two weeks. And if it's belabored it might go three to four weeks. But if there is nothing new, I don't see how it can go into the long end of it,"" he said. ""I'd say keep it short and simple without truncating or shortening the basics that you need. Especially if there's no new information that comes forward,"" he added.On witnesses, Braun said he respected Trump's desire to have exculpatory evidence presented at the trial but he cautioned that ""witnesses would be a double-edged sword.""""We've heard him talk about a fully litigated defense in the Senate but I think once they get down to the strategy in the Senate, does that make sense? Does it turn into a circus? Where do you start and stop. How many witnesses?""How a trial could unfoldRepublicans are beginning to see the Senate impeachment trial in two parts. The first, the presentations from the House managers and the White House. Then, there would be a decision. Do senators need to hear witnesses? Or, would they rather take the offramp and vote. McConnell laid out the two scenarios to reporters on Tuesday, making clear that no decisions have been made at this point. But he made two central points as he did. First, if after the two presentations 51 senators are in agreement that the trial should come to an end, teeing up final votes on the two articles of impeachment, then that's all it would take to make it happen. With Republicans in control of 53 seats in the Senate, even if Democrats took the position that they wanted to push forward with votes to hear from witnesses like Bolton and Mulvaney, it would take only Republican votes to snuff that idea out. Second, McConnell also reiterated his view that finding the 67 votes to actually remove Trump from office is, at least at this point, a virtual impossibility -- something that would underscore the argument for not delaying what Republican senators view as an inevitable acquittal. ""I would be totally surprised if there were 67 senators to remove the President,"" McConnell said. ""That remains my view.""Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, told CNN she doesn't know how she will feel after the presentations of evidence from both sides, but that she might be ready to vote without hearing witnesses. There's also the issue of whether senators have reached the point where they simply want to move on after the presentations, given the trial essentially shuts down all other business in the chamber and requires senators to be present, and in their seats, six days a week without the ability to speak. ""I think at some point people just going to get real tired of this,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican.Asked if he would support moving forward with a vote without witnesses, Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, wouldn't speculate how it shakes out.""We haven't even agreed to the rules yet,"" Kennedy said.   "
Elizabeth Warren made at least $1.9 million for past private legal work,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-releases-income-private-legal-work/index.html," (CNN)Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Sunday night released new details about her time doing corporate legal work, a period going back more than 30 years in which she made at least $1.9 million from private clients.The disclosure comes as she faces pressure from South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been pushing the Massachusetts senator to offer up additional tax returns from that period, which traces back decades.In the new release, Warren provides a personal compensation figure to each of the cases that she initially listed in May. It does not include previously unreleased tax information. Warren has already released tax returns going back 11 years.The released documents provide new insight into the occasionally lucrative cases she took while doing private sector work, but is unlikely to tamp down the increasingly sharp war of words between the two campaigns, which recent polling suggests could be drawing from an overlapping group of Democratic primary voters.Last week, Warren took the rare-for-her step of directly calling on Buttigieg, during an exchange with reporters, to open up his private fundraisers, reveal the individuals bundling donations for his campaign and name clients he worked with during his time at McKinsey, an elite consulting firm.Buttigieg has said his refusal to open up in more detail about his work at McKinsey is mandated by a nondisclosure agreement from which he is seeking to be released. On Friday, he published a description of ""client engagements"" from the period, but it did not include a detailed list. He has also been noncommittal when asked if he would allow reporters into his fundraisers, as former Vice President Joe Biden has. Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, unlike their moderate rivals, have sworn off big dollar fundraisers.A senior Warren aide made the case Sunday night that, by releasing the income information in this form, the campaign is providing more detail -- in the form of itemized figures -- than voters would be able to derive from tax return documents.  The senior aide also said that, given Warren's earlier release of 11 years of tax returns, the request for her to provide some four decades of returns represents a double standard. In a statement Sunday night, Warren communications director Kristen Orthman said, ""Today, we have updated that disclosure (from May) to include all the income she earned from each case that we have been able to determine from public records, Elizabeth's personal records, and other sources.""""Any candidate who refuses to provide basic details about his or her own record and refuses to allow voters or the press to understand who is buying access to their time and what they are getting in return will be seen by voters as part of the same business-as-usual politics that voters have consistently rejected,"" Orthman added, echoing Warren's own indictment of Buttigieg.CNN's Daniella Diaz contributed to this report"
The Point: Why today's impeachment hearing worked,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/judiciary-committee-marathon-session/index.html,"You might think that a hearing that began at 9 a.m. ET and could easily extend past the 12-hour mark might be overwhelming. Or filled with partisan vitriol and name-calling. And there was some of that! I mean, Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is on this committee, after all!But taken as a whole, the mark-up hearing -- essentially a series of attempts to change small or large parts of the language of the articles of impeachment -- was packed full of information. You had a constitutional law professor (Maryland Democratic Jamie Raskin) debating with a constitutional law litigator of the other party (Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson). You had an extended debate about the origins of executive privilege and how it should be understood in the context of this impeachment hearing against Trump. You had a long back-and-forth over the separation of powers and just how much the legislative (or executive) branch should have within our government.Taken as a whole, it was a multi-hour, rollicking conversation between a lot of very powerful people about why they were there, what it meant for Trump and, most importantly, what it all means for the future of the country. For much of the time, a majority of the 40-plus members of the committee stayed in their seats in the hearing, listening to the arguments of their side and the other side -- and seeking to either prop up or rebut something they had heard.It wasn't perfect. But it felt we were watching the way Congress should work -- a group of elected officials debating their colleagues in, generally speaking, a serious way. It felt like the sort of hearing we should have when the matter being debated is as grave as impeachment of a sitting president. And it felt a world away from the previous two impeachment hearings held by the House Judiciary Committee, in which members simply yelled one another and gave a series of pre-prepared five-minute speeches.The Point: If more people wind up leaving this impeachment process with a better understanding of the ""how and why"" behind what Congress does, that will be a silver lining in what is quite clearly a very dark cloud over Washington these days."
Melania Trump defends her son after professor's joke at impeachment hearing,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/melania-trump-barron-trump-impeachment-hearing/index.html," (CNN)Melania Trump admonished one of the legal scholars testifying at Wednesday's impeachment inquiry hearing after the professor made a joke involving her son, Barron, for which the professor later apologized.""A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it,"" the first lady said in a fiery tweet aimed directly at Stanford Law professor Pamela Karlan, an impeachment witness for House Democrats.Trump was addressing Karlan's mention of Barron Trump in her testimony, wherein she used the 13-year-old's first name in an analogy to make an argument about the differences between kings and presidents. ""The Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility, so while the President can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron,"" said Karlan, who is in favor of President Donald Trump being impeached.Karlan later apologized for her remark, saying, ""I want to apologize for what i said earlier about the President's son, it was wrong of me to do that. I wish the President would apologize, obviously, for the things he's done that's wrong, but I do regret having said that.""It was the first time Trump has weighed in publicly on the ongoing impeachment inquiry and investigation into her husband. Asked about Trump's tweet, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN, ""I think Mrs. Trump's tweet speaks very clearly for itself."" Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who is one of Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, directly confronted Karlan about the comment during his period of questioning at the hearing.""Let me also suggest that when you invoke the President's son's name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument. It makes you look mean,"" Gaetz said to Karlan. ""It makes you look like you're attacking someone's family, the minor child of the president of the United States.""Vice President Mike Pence, during an appearance in Holland, Michigan, also slammed Karlan's comment.""The impeachment hearings today reached a new low,"" Pence said. ""I just heard at the hearing today, one of the Democrats' witnesses actually used the President and first lady's 13-year-old son to justify their partisan impeachment. Democrats should be ashamed. Enough is enough.""While minor children of presidents have occasionally received criticism and scrutiny, it's long been a tradition in Washington to keep first children out of the political fray.In 2017, Chelsea Clinton -- who was one year younger than Barron Trump is now when her father, Bill Clinton, became president -- defended the youngest child of Donald Trump. ""It's high time the media & everyone leave Barron Trump alone & let him have the private childhood he deserves,"" Clinton wrote."
More than 500 legal scholars sign letter saying Trump committed 'impeachable conduct',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/legal-scholars-letter-trump-impeachment/index.html," (CNN)More than 500 legal scholars signed on to a letter published Friday accusing President Donald Trump of having ""engaged in impeachable conduct"" in his dealings in Ukraine.""There is overwhelming evidence that President Trump betrayed his oath of office by seeking to use presidential power to pressure a foreign government to help him distort an American election, for his personal and political benefit, at the direct expense of national security interests as determined by Congress,"" they wrote. ""His conduct is precisely the type of threat to our democracy that the Founders feared when they included the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution.""The letter comes after four other legal scholars testified at the first House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing Wednesday, with three of them making the case for impeaching Trump. The dozens of academics -- hailing from a variety of educational institutions including Yale, Columbia and Rutgers -- said in the letter that they were not taking a stance on whether Trump committed a crime.""But conduct need not be criminal to be impeachable,"" the group added. ""The standard here is constitutional; it does not depend on what Congress has chosen to criminalize.""They pointed to treason and bribery as the two potential charges prompting impeachment ""because they include conduct undertaken not in the 'faithful execution' of public office that the Constitution requires, but instead for personal gain (bribery) or to benefit a foreign enemy (treason).""The scholars cited Trump's phone call asking the Ukrainian President for a ""favor,"" his and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's public statements about the call, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's role pursuing Ukrainian investigations, and testimony from top US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that Trump held military aid and White House visits as incentives for Ukraine to launch investigations into his political rivals.The group highlighted impeachment as a key check against ""conduct that corrupts elections.""  ""Corrupting elections subverts the process by which the Constitution makes the president democratically accountable,"" the scholars wrote. ""Put simply, if a President cheats in his effort at re-election, trusting the democratic process to serve as a check through that election is no remedy at all. That is what impeachment is for."""

Ronny Jackson, filed on Monday to run for Congress in Texas' 13th District.Jackson filed his paperwork Monday afternoon at the Republican Party of Texas' headquarters in Austin, the group's communications director, Sam Pohl, confirmed to CNN.The move comes following Jackson's retirement from the Navy last week as the Defense Department's Inspector General continues to investigate allegations that he was periodically intoxicated and mishandled prescription drugs. Jackson withdrew from consideration to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs in light of similar allegations last year.Dwrena Allen, spokeswoman for the inspector general, confirmed to CNN on Monday that the Pentagon inspector general's investigation into Jackson remains ongoing. CNN has reached out to Jackson for comment.A Texas native, Jackson is running as a Republican in the 13th District, which opened after longtime GOP incumbent Rep. Mac Thornberry announced his retirement in September. Trump won the district by 63 points in 2016.Jackson will face a crowded primary, as 13 other candidates are running for the Republican nomination, Pohl told CNN. Monday is the last day to file for candidacy to appear on the primary ballot in Texas, according to the Texas secretary of state's office.Trump re-nominated Jackson to receive a second star -- a bump in his military rank -- in February, though that promotion was not approved by the Senate. This came less than a year after Jackson withdrew from consideration as Trump's nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs over allegations that he was ""abusive"" toward colleagues, loosely handled prescription pain medications and was periodically intoxicated. Jackson denied all of the allegations leveled against him, calling them ""completely false and fabricated.""CNN's Barbara Starr and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report."
Analysis: Phantom phone call? Timeline suggests there was no Trump-Sondland phone call on Sept. 9,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/witness-testimony-casts-doubt-on-trump-sondland-phone-call/index.html,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump keeps pointing to a phone call that supposedly happened on September 9 as a key element in his defense of his conduct in the Ukraine scandal.But it's unclear if that conversation actually took place on that day -- and what's known about the communications between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, actually further implicates the President.According to Sondland's testimony, it was during this call that Trump told him he wanted ""nothing"" from Ukraine, and Trump has repeatedly referenced this call as evidence for his claim that there was no attempt to withhold congressionally appropriated security aid to Ukraine in return for other things Trump personally wanted and outlined in a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But this claim is contradicted by other parts of Sondland's own testimony: namely, that the White House did place conditions on official actions, like a White House invitation for Zelensky.Trump's defense becomes even flimsier when you consider how others reacted to the purported Sondland-Trump call when they learned about it. Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council official, testified to Congress that he got a ""sinking feeling"" after Sondland told him on September 7 of a call he had just had with Trump.Given the stark difference in how the call has been characterized by different people, there has been some speculation about whether there were two phone calls that took place.But a review of the timeline that has emerged from testimony during the impeachment inquiry does not support that theory. Instead, testimony from Morrison and Taylor indicate that the call took place on September 7, and in a far different manner described by Sondland and Trump.That call, according to testimony from Morrison, as well as from Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, suggests that Trump did in fact lay out a quid pro quo to Sondland, including specific demands for Zelensky. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee picked up on this discrepancy in their impeachment inquiry report released on Tuesday, writing,  ""A call on September 9, which would have occurred in the middle of the night, is at odds with the weight of the evidence and not backed up by any records the White House was willing to provide Ambassador Sondland.""What Sondland remembersIn his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on November 20, Sondland said he had called Trump on what he believed was September 9 and asked him what he wanted from Ukraine. Trump, Sondland testified, responded, ""I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.'""Sondland also testified that the call could have occurred as early as September 6. During the hearing before Congress, Sondland repeatedly testified that he did not take notes and could not recall many details when asked by lawmakers.And according to Sondland, the White House has not been able to locate phone records for a call between Trump and him on September 9. An unnamed administration official told The Washington Post that the White House was unable to find a record in its switchboard of a September 9 call between Trump and Sondland.An unnamed White House official also told the Post that calls made on the President's cell phone are not always logged in the switchboard, particularly when he is in the residence. As the Post points out, if the call did take place as Sondland described, it would have happened in the 5 a.m. hour, a period of time when Trump is usually in the White House residence.Morrison's versionMorrison, however, recalls a far different phone call between Sondland and Trump, one in which Trump requested action from Zelensky.During his closed-door testimony on October 31, Morrison recalled a conversation he'd had with Sondland on September 7 regarding a phone call Sondland said he'd just had with Trump.According to Morrison, Sondland told him ""that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it.""Morrison then relayed this information to Taylor, which Taylor confirmed in his opening statement during his November 13 testimony. Morrison also testified that he had told his boss, former national security adviser John Bolton, as well as National Security Council lawyers, about the conversation.During his public testimony, Sondland did not refute Taylor and Morrison's recollection on this timeline.Taylor's testimonyTaylor has also testified that in a phone call with Sondland on September 8 that he was told by the ambassador that Trump wanted Zelensky to announce the investigations publicly but that this ""was not a 'quid pro quo.' """"I believe this was the same conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump that Mr. Morrison had described to me on September 7,"" Taylor said.This lines up with a text message exchange between Sondland, Taylor and former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.According to the messages, on September 8, Sondland texted the group that he'd had ""multiple"" conversations with Zelensky and Trump. After Sondland and Taylor talked by phone, Taylor sent his now-infamous text message:""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Taylor wrote the group.According to the time stamps on the text messages, five hours later, on the morning of September 9, Sondland texted back saying that Taylor was ""incorrect about President Trump's intentions"" and that Trump wants ""no quid pro quo's of any kind.""This story has been updatedCNN's Gloria Borger contributed to this report."
Trump warns that Kim Jong Un could lose 'special relationship' with him amid reports of missile site test,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/politics/north-korea-donald-trump-test-kim-jong-un/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)President Donald Trump warned Sunday that North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un could ""void"" their ""special relationship"" amid reports that the hermit nation conducted an ""important"" test at a missile site. ""Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way,"" Trump wrote in a pair of tweets. ""He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States...""The warning from Trump, whose at-times rocky relationship with Kim has been a hallmark of his presidency, comes as a senior administration official tells CNN that the White House has ""seen the reports of a test, and are coordinating closely with allies and partners."" On Saturday, the Korean Central News Agency reported that a ""very important test took place at the Sohae Satellite launching Ground"" that day. According to KCNA, the test produced a ""successful result,"" was of ""great significance,"" and will ""change the strategic position of North Korea in the near the future."" However, it was not immediately clear what was tested.A satellite image obtained by CNN Thursday indicated North Korea may be preparing to resume testing engines used to power satellite launchers and intercontinental ballistic missiles at Sohae, according to experts who analyzed the photo.It showed new activity at the site and the presence of a large shipping container at the facility's engine test stand, according to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, which works in partnership with the imaging company.Additional commercial satellite images captured on Saturday and Sunday by Planet Labs suggest North Korea conducted a rocket engine test at the same site, Lewis said.""Vehicles and objects appear on December 7 to conduct the test. They are mostly gone on December 8, but the ground appears to have been disturbed by the exhaust from the test,"" he noted. Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation, along with several other North Korea analysts, have noted that the Trump administration has not taken a very tough approach with Pyongyang, declining to apply a wide range of the sanctions at its disposal against either North Korea or countries that do business with it, such as China. The White House has also made repeated concessions to Kim, canceling and postponing the Pentagon's joint military exercises with South Korea, most recently in November, after North Korea had objected. Those steps have not yielded progress, Klingner and others said. ""President Trump has adopted a weaker version of the Obama Administration's strategic patience police and timid incrementalism of sanctions enforcement,"" Klingner told CNN in November. Though Trump said in his Sunday tweets that North Korea ""must denuclearize as promised,"" the country's ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, said Saturday that denuclearization was off the table in negotiations with the US, which he claimed had been a ""time-saving trick"" to benefit a ""domestic political agenda.""Diplomats from Pyongyang and Washington have been attempting to negotiate a trade that would see Kim give up the country's nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles used to deliver them in exchange for relief from punishing US and United Nations sanctions that have crippled the North Korean economy. But North Korea is seeking sanctions relief the US has so far refused to provide and working talks have failed to get off the ground. Some analysts say North Korea has little incentive to deal with lower level US officials when the President has repeatedly inserted himself into negotiations and based them, in part, on the strength of his relationship with the North Korean leader.The potential tests this weekend should come as no surprise to Trump as Pyongyang has been threatening to do a test of some kind for some time, in part because the country is angry about not seeing sanctions relief and because the US and South Korea have continued with planning for joint military drills. A foreign ministry official said last week that Pyongyang was preparing a ""Christmas gift"" for Washington, but warned that the present the Trump administration will receive depends on events in the coming days.'Dotard' and 'Rocket man'Trump's new warning could indicate a potential shift in his relationship with Kim, which he has touted as successful since he first met with the leader in 2018 in Singapore. On Saturday, the President told reporters at the White House that he has ""a very good"" relationship with Kim and that he thinks they both want to ""keep it that way."" ""The relationship is very good, but you know, there is certain hostility, there's no doubt about it,"" Trump said. In October, CNN reported that Kim has praised his ""special"" relationship with Trump, with one of North Korea's most respected diplomats telling state media the two leaders maintain ""trust in each other.""But as Trump noted, his relationship with North Korea hasn't always been rosy. In August 2017, the President threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if Kim continued to threaten the US.  Last week, a senior member of the North Korean government again described Trump as a ""dotard"" after he revived the war of words with Kim by calling him ""Rocket Man.""""If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard,"" Choe Son Hui, North Korea's First Vice-Foreign Minister, was quoted as saying by the country's state news agency. The statement was the latest in a series of increasingly dire warnings by North Korea, and recalled the strong language between the two leaders that escalated in 2017, before the landmark meeting the following year in Singapore.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct North Korea analyst Bruce Klingner's name.CNN's Nicole Gaouette, Joshua Berlinger, Yoonjung Seo and Jonny Hallam contributed to this report.

America in microcosm: the parallel realities of a fateful impeachment debate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/impeachment-judiciary-committee-debate-vote/index.html,"Meeting under the eye of history in a rare evening session Wednesday, Democratic and Republican lawmakers spoke past one another, unable to coalesce even on a common set of facts.In a hearing that was more surreal than somber despite its grave intent, they might as well have been talking about a different President, a different Constitution and a different nation.OPINION: The Navy, grace and Star Wars: three ways to heal AmericaDemocrats at least operated from the evidence unearthed by the impeachment inquiry as individual members took advantage of a prime-time spotlight to claim their moment for posterity and to accuse Trump of violating his oath of office in Ukraine.""How would you be remembered?"" Democratic Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, asked his colleagues, beseeching them to examine their consciences and the record.History may record that while both sides were playing to the political gallery, only the Democrats appeared willing to go into any details on Trump's alleged conduct and its consequences.Republicans mostly disregarded the mountain of evidence offered by former Trump appointees and foreign policy and military officials of the President's political motivations in Ukraine.""The biggest lie isn't that the President committed an impeachable offense,"" said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee.""The biggest, most dangerous lie is that the President, as an American citizen, is guilty until proven innocent.""The founders might have imagined the wrenching business of impeaching a President would at least spark a debate -- even among rivals -- on whether his behavior reached such a bar. After all, although two previous presidents were impeached -- and Richard Nixon resigned before absorbing that blow -- Congress has never thrown a commander-in-chief out of office.But from the Republican side there were few defenses of Trump on the merits of the case that Democrats have brought against him. There was sparse discussion of whether what he did was impeachable. Like their President, few Republicans are willing to admit there was any wrongdoing whatsoever -- mirroring a sharp divide over almost every aspect of Trump's conduct in the nation as a whole.Most GOP members did not indulge in the kind of unhinged circus acts that some had expected and that Trump might have tuned in hoping to see. But they did embrace the President's stunning new argument that envisages an executive immune from limits on his authority — that abusing power is not an impeachable offense.The hearing was the start of a grueling two-day process expected to end with lawmakers voting on party lines to send articles of impeachment to the House for a full vote next week.On Thursday, Republicans are expected to offer many amendments to the texts, all of which are expected to be shot down by the Democratic majority on the panel.The impeachment of a President is one of the most stately and serious moments in the nation's history. Yet given the all but inevitable outcome -- an acquittal of Trump in a Senate trial -- the hearing often failed to rise above the bitter politics.The case against TrumpNadler posed three questions at the hearing Wednesday: Does the evidence support the case that Trump pressured Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election? Is such action impeachable? And what are the consequences for US national security and democratic integrity?""The highest of high crimes is abuse of power. It occurs when a President uses his official powers to serve his own personal, selfish interests at the expense of the public good,"" Nadler said.The New York Democrat argued, as if oblivious to Trump's disinformation machine that has fogged public understanding of the case, that the facts were clear and undeniable and warned, ""if elections are corrupt, everything is corrupt.""""The threat is urgent. If we do not act -- now -- what happens next will be our responsibility as well as his,"" Nadler said.Democrats have tabled just two articles of impeachment. The first charges the President with abusing his power in withholding military aid and recognition for Ukraine and demanding political favors.They also accuse Trump of obstructing Congress in its constitutional purpose of overseeing the executive, with his claim of ""absolute immunity"" to withhold witnesses and evidence.""Anything we don't know about what Donald Trump did is because Donald Trump continues to this moment to block us,"" said California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, urging his colleagues to show courage to check a ""constitutional crime spree.""The many comparisons made by lawmakers with the Watergate scandal nearly 50 years ago only served to show how fierce polarization that has gridlocked American democracy since then has made the perception of justice run along party lines.Who is actually being impeached?Anyone tuning into the hearing to hear GOP arguments and who was unfamiliar with the case would have thought the Democratic Congress, not Trump, is about to be impeached.Trump's troops on the committee were quick to embrace the President's latest office-expanding defense: that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.They claimed that Democrats so despised Trump that they had been bent on impeaching him since he won in 2016. Republicans are correct that many Democrats issued calls for Trump's impeachment months before Ukraine was an issue. But they ignore the fact that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to embark on such a politically risky track before the current scandal and on the basis of former special counsel Robert Mueller's implication that Trump obstructed justice.Republicans also completely ignored the entire record of Trump's conduct in Ukraine, the backdoor diplomatic track to fulfill his political demands led by Rudy Giuliani and Trump's own words. For the GOP, the transcript of a call that shows Trump pressuring Ukraine and asking for an investigation of his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden is clear evidence of his innocence of such an offense.Collins leveled the remarkable charge that Democrats and not Trump, who tried to leverage his disproportionate power over a weaker foreign leader, were ""tearing down"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.The most substantive Republican arguments came not in the conspiracy theories raised by some members to distract from the evidence but on the speed of the process.Democrats have elected not to challenge many of Trump's claims of immunity in court but to fold his blocking tactics into the obstruction of Congress article of impeachment.House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California has explained the decision follows lengthy delays already encountered by Democratic cases already before the courts.But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a retiring Wisconsin Republican who was in town when Bill Clinton was impeached two decades ago, remembered how Supreme Court judgments against Nixon on the turning over of evidence eventually brought him down.Another Republican, Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama, made an impassioned intervention, warning: ""Tomorrow we write history.""""I implore my colleagues to take a hard look at the course of this investigation,"" she said, claiming violations of due process and warning that it has been politicized.Yet politics is in the eye of the beholder. Republicans were unwilling to commit a single second of the hearing to offer even the most tepid criticism of Trump, a force who dominates their party with iron rule.Still, Roby's contribution did raise questions about whether Democrats are driving the impeachment process too quickly -- perhaps to hand it to the Senate for a trial before their presidential primary race kicks off in February.A show for prime timeOther Republicans lacked Roby's gravity. Some seemed mostly interested in creating moments for the Fox News opinion shows that are their regular evening stomping ground.GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, warning of a ""dangerous time in America,"" used his five minutes of live television to possibly out an intelligence official Republicans say is the Ukraine whistleblower as part of a list of names people he wanted to have testify.Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan accused Democrats of despising Trump and his voters.""They don't like the 63 million people who voted for this President. All of us in flyover country, all of us from Ohio, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Texas, they don't like us,"" Jordan said.His Florida colleague Rep. Matt Gaetz underscored what this line of attack was really about.""We'll see you on the field in 2020,"" he fumed at the Democratic side of the room."
New York Times: Giuliani traveled to Hungary and Ukraine to meet with ex-prosecutors in effort to defend Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-visit-interviews-documentary/index.html,"Washington  (CNN)Rudy Giuliani traveled to Hungary and Ukraine this week to meet with several former Ukrainian prosecutors in an effort to defend President Donald Trump against House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, The New York Times reported Wednesday.The Times, citing conversations with people familiar with the matter, said the President's personal attorney went to Budapest, Hungary, on Tuesday to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, before going to Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday to meet with a number of other former prosecutors in the country, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk. Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney and a key player in the President's dealings with Ukraine, traveled to speak with the former prosecutors for a documentary series meant to bolster unproven and debunked claims of corruption at the heart of the probe.The ex-prosecutors have ""all played some role in promoting claims"" about former Vice President Joe Biden, former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, the paper said. Those claims have been key to Trump and Giuliani's efforts to get Ukraine to announce investigations into matters that would benefit the President's 2020 reelection effort, according to House impeachment investigators.When asked about the trip, Giuliani's spokeswoman Christianné Allen said his work was ""still confidential.""""What Mr. Giuliani is doing at this point is still confidential and is for the sole purpose of proving his clients innocence. In doing so he will prove that this latest farce is even more baseless and malicious than the first attempted coup takedown. Once all individuals have returned safely to the United States, we will reveal the significant witnesses involved,"" said Allen in a statement to CNN.Giuliani faces continued scrutiny over his business dealings and congressional lawmakers are investigating the motives behind his efforts to oust Yovanovitch. His Ukraine trip occurred on the same day that House Democrats released a report on the impeachment inquiry, detailing in part Giuliani's role in the scandal. The trips were ""organized around the filming of a multipart television series featuring Mr. Giuliani that is being produced and aired by a conservative cable channel, One America News, or OAN,"" the Times said, adding that the host of the series, Chanel Rion, joined the the former New York mayor on his trip and conducted an interview with Lutsenko. The paper said the series ""is being promoted as a Republican alternative to the impeachment hearings."" During the Tuesday interview, Lutsenko discussed with Rion some of the things Trump wanted investigated by Ukraine, the Times said. Asked by the Times about the meetings, Giuliani told the paper that ""like a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him' by the news media and Democrats."" The President's lawyer did not respond to the Times' question about whether he told Trump about his trip or his connection to the the OAN series, the paper said.The network told the paper that it ""would release additional details (about the interviews) 'upon return of OAN staff to U.S. soil,' "" the Times said."
FBI agents warn of 'chilling effect' from Trump and Barr attacks,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/fbi-chilling-effect-trump-barr-attacks/index.html,"Current and former FBI officials tell CNN they're concerned that the harsh rhetoric coming from Trump and Barr has only worsened the bureau's already tenuous standing with the President, leaving them wondering whether federal agents could be less aggressive the next time they have to pursue a sensitive investigation. ""We're constantly told to be agile and use all the legal tools available to us,"" said one FBI employee who works on counterintelligence matters. ""But who is going to risk sticking their neck out now only to have DOJ chop it off?""Barr this week seized on findings in a blockbuster inspector general report to scold the FBI for using ""intrusive"" tools with only ""flimsy"" evidence, and he questioned whether they'd been motivated by bias. Those attacks were particularly noteworthy given that the report found no evidence of bias or improper motivation in the FBI's decisions to use  counterintelligence techniques. The report did however point out serious mistakes and mishandling of evidence by the FBI.  In his criticism, Barr has used language that hews closely to conspiracies from Trump, who maintains that his campaign was illegally spied on. During a rally on Tuesday night, Trump used the word ""scum"" to refer to FBI employees he believes acted improperly.""These comments will have a chilling effect on the workforce,"" said one recently retired agent who has handled surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the kind abused according to the inspector general report.Investigative toolsIf there are more administrative hurdles, and concern that actions will be second-guessed, agents may decide to avoid certain investigative tools, the former agent said. That includes pursuing things like FISA warrants to surveil targets, a process that is frequently used by investigators, but was riddled with errors during the Russia investigation, the inspector general found.  As they sought to determine if members of the Trump campaign were colluding with the Russian government in the run-up to the 2016 election, FBI officials in Washington turned to what were standard measures for the bureau but that were used in extraordinary circumstances to investigate a presidential campaign.Informants were deployed to meet and record conversations with certain campaign aides, and FISA warrants targeted Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, allowing the FBI to eavesdrop on his calls and look back on his messages.While he found no evidence of political bias in the FBI's investigation, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz called out ""failure"" among the ranks of the FBI for making a number of ""basic and fundamental errors"" as they sought permission to obtain the FISA warrants.On Wednesday Horowitz criticized the application process for the FISA warrants on Page. ""Let me put it this way, I would not have submitted the one they put in,"" Horowitz said.Barr, in an interview with NBC News Tuesday, heightened the failure to an accusation of civil liberties abuse.""The greatest danger to our free system is that the incumbent government use the apparatus of the state, principally the law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies, both to spy on political opponents, but also to use them in a way that could affect the outcome of the election,"" Barr said.As the head of the Justice Department, Barr is two steps above the FBI's director, Christopher Wray, and defenders of the agency have called Barr's pejorative use of the term ""spying"" inappropriate.  ""For the boss of the boss of the FBI director to be criticizing how the FBI does that and to use those types of terms is not helpful,"" said Robert Anderson, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who signed off on numerous FISA warrants before becoming a top executive under former director James Comey.Barr was looking at the situation through a political lens, rather than strictly at the facts of the case, Anderson said.He disagreed, however, that the political rhetoric could impede the work of rank and file agents.""I don't know if it has a chilling effect at the workforce level because most of the men and women, analysts and linguists, are not tied to any of the political nonsense at headquarters,"" Anderson said.Ignoring the criticismAgents and employees in the field have tried to ignore the political criticism and constant headlines, and some are disappointed in the actions of past FBI leadership, an agent told CNN.""We want to be proud of our agency,"" the agent said, but after more than two years ""we don't have time to dwell on it.""Agents continue to work their cases, putting in long hours, the agent said.One of the concerns arising from the internal watchdog investigation is the finding of what the inspector general said were a series of missteps up and down the FBI chain of command, despite the fact officials knew the case was going to be highly scrutinized. ""You had the highest levels of the organization working on this, and they made such epic failures that they're going to bring down the entire organization because of the incompetence in how they did their jobs,"" the retired agent said.FBI agents and employees are often accused of having swagger, viewing themselves as better investigators than those from other government agencies.The problems identified in the inspector general report, along with the attacks from political leaders, hurts that pride, current and former employees say.In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Republican chairman Lindsey Graham seized on these failures in questioning Horowitz, asking him whether they representative of the bureau on the whole ""I certainly hope that that is not the way others are following these practices,"" Horowitz said.Wray's responseFBI Director Wray has sought to support the agency in the aftermath of the report with a video message that went out to staff and a letter that was sent to former employees.In a series of interviews on Monday, Wray also pointed to the fact that Horowitz found that the investigation was properly opened, though he called the problems identified in the report ""unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution."" In a response included in the report, Wray described more than 40 steps the FBI was taking to address recommendations made by the inspector general, including changes to make the processes for seeking FISA warrants ""more stringent and less susceptible to mistake or inaccuracy."" At the oversight hearing Wednesday, Graham, a close Republican ally of the President, suggested a broader overhaul of the FISA system would be necessary if law enforcement wanted to keep the power. ""I would hate to lose the ability of the FISA court to operate at a time probably when we need it the most. But after your report, I have serious concerns about whether the FISA court can continue unless there is fundamental reform,"" Graham said. David Szady, a second former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, underscored the value that law enforcement derives from FISA surveillance, but agreed that more oversight to that tool and others used by investigators in the Russia probe was a good thing.  ""They're just so intrusive. You're talking about using techniques, whether they're human sources or technical sources, against a US citizen, so you want to make sure your information is as solid as possible,"" Szady said."
Analysis: New evidence raises the question — is Nunes an investigator or participant in Ukraine affair?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/nunes-ukraine-controversy/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, was closer to the central figures in the Ukraine scandal than he let on, even as his committee investigated the matter, according to congressional findings and news reports.A sweeping report from House Democrats indicated that Nunes and a top aide exchanged multiple phone calls, at key moments, with President Donald Trump's allies who were digging up dirt in Ukraine about Trump's political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden. The new developments create a strange and unprecedented twist in which a sitting lawmaker, let alone the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, is embroiled in the very matter the committee is investigating. It's unclear what role Nunes played -- at the least, he's a potential witness; at worst, he's an active participant.Phone records subpoenaed by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee indicate that Nunes was in contact with Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associate Lev Parnas at a time when they were soliciting damaging information about Biden from Ukrainian officials.House Democrats have also accused Giuliani of coordinating with Trump to pressure Ukraine's president into announcing an investigation into Biden, which would help Trump's 2020 campaign. Along the way, Giuliani and Nunes publicly promoted many of the debunked theories about Biden.Nunes, a California Republican, was already fending off accusations from Democrats that he played a role in the scheme. And Parnas, through his attorney, previously told CNN that Nunes spoke directly with some of the Ukrainians, and that one of his senior aides, Derek Harvey, participated in strategy sessions with Giuliani.Taken together, the revelations from the past few weeks make it clear that Nunes was much closer than previously known to Giuliani and Parnas, who are both under criminal investigation.Nunes has disputed some claims about his ties to Ukrainians, specifically that he visited Vienna last year to meet a former Ukrainian prosecutor who offered dirt on the Bidens. Nunes denied meeting the ex-official, Viktor Shokin, in a defamation lawsuit he filed against CNN this week. Phone calls and strategy sessionsEarlier this year, Giuliani held regular strategy sessions to discuss his Ukraine plans at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, according to Parnas' lawyer Joseph Bondy. These meetings included Parnas, conservative columnist John Solomon and Republican attorneys Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, CNN previously reported.  Parnas said that Nunes aide Harvey occasionally attended, and that Parnas understood Harvey was there as Nunes' proxy, Bondy told CNN. Phone records disclosed in the Democratic report indicate that Parnas and Harvey had at least three phone calls in February, though the content of their conversations is unknown. This was the first official confirmation of a link between Parnas and Harvey. The phone records also suggest that many who attended those meetings at Trump's hotel remained in regular contact throughout the spring, when Solomon started publishing columns in The Hill containing conspiracy theories about the Bidens.The phone records indicate that Nunes connected with Giuliani on April 10. That same week, the phone records show that Giuliani was also in touch with Parnas and Solomon, who had just published two new columns. The Democratic report also highlighted a flurry of activity on April 12, when there were phone calls between a number of parties: Giuliani and an unidentified White House number, Parnas and Giuliani, Parnas and Solomon, and also Parnas and Nunes. The records indicate that on one of those calls, Parnas and Nunes spoke for longer than eight minutes, though it's still unknown what they discussed.Nunes says he has never met Parnas, but played coy about the extent of their relationship.""You know, it's possible,"" Nunes said Tuesday on Fox News, on whether he ever spoke to Parnas. ""But I haven't gone through all my phone records. I don't really recall that name. You know, I remember the name now because he has been indicted... I will go back and check all my records, but it seems very unlikely that I would be taking calls from random people.""One month after Nunes' alleged calls with Parnas, Giuliani spoke with Harvey, according to phone records from May 8. That call happened as Giuliani was preparing to travel to Ukraine to potentially meet with Shokin and some of the officials who were peddling the questionable theories in Solomon's columns. Giuliani nixed the trip after his plans were revealed in the press and Trump weighed in.The Daily Beast also reported that another Parnas lawyer claimed that his client helped arrange meetings and phone calls for Nunes in Europe. That lawyer, Ed MacMahon, also said Harvey attended some of these overseas meetings, which were for Nunes' investigative work. Harvey did not comment when reached by CNN for previous stories about Ukrainian meetings. ""If this story is correct, the Ranking Member (Nunes) may have actually been projecting and in fact he may be the fact witness if he is working with indicted individuals around our investigation,"" Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said at an impeachment hearing last month. The Democratic report directly accused Nunes and the others of having these conversations, based on the records subpoenaed from Verizon and AT&T, which is the parent company of CNN. But the report did not disclose the actual phone numbers, only the duration and alleged participants. Conspiracies take center stageMany of Solomon's columns included unsubstantiated claims that Biden abused his powers to protect his son's position on the board of Burisma, and that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election to help Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Nearly all of these theories have been recanted, debunked or discredited by witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, said ""all the key elements"" of the columns ""were false.""But that didn't stop Nunes from repeating many of them at nearly every public hearing held by the House Intelligence Committee.""The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling and they defend Hunter Biden's securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company, all while his father served as vice president,"" Nunes said at the first public impeachment hearing November 13.After declaring the inquiry ""a direct-to-TV sequel to the Russia collusion hoax"" at another hearing, Nunes posed questions about Biden: ""Why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden? And what did he do for them? And did his position impact any U.S. government actions under the Obama administration?"" The answers to Nunes' queries have been readily available -- while questions of ethics and judgment remain, no evidence has emerged implicating Biden in corruption or abusing his office. The US intelligence community believes that some of the theories Nunes endorsed, especially that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election, actually originated from Russian operatives as part of an orchestrated disinformation campaign, CNN has reported. For months, Giuliani fanned the flames on Fox News and in regular Twitter posts, where he accused Biden and other Democrats of crimes. Just this week, Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to meet with some of the same former officials, including Shokin, who peddled the theories about Biden in the first place. What's next for Nunes?Nunes is no stranger to controversy. He was forced to step back from running the committee's Russia inquiry in 2017 after he was caught coordinating with the White House to undermine the inquiry.This time around, Nunes is dangerously close to the scandal yet again. During the hearings, Nunes repeatedly chided Democrats because they allegedly ""got campaign dirt from Ukrainians in the 2016 election."" Now his own interest in obtaining information from foreign sources is under scrutiny. Republicans also used the House Intelligence Committee hearings to turn the tables on its Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California. They accused Schiff of coordinating with the US intelligence community whistleblower who first raised concerns about Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower was in touch with committee staff, but not with any members, before filing the complaint.  Nunes maintains he didn't do anything wrong and praised Giuliani for his exploits in Ukraine. ""It would be dereliction of duty for the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to not go to Ukraine to figure out what on earth were the Democrats doing in Ukraine, paying for dirt from Ukrainian officials to dirty up the Trump campaign in 2016,"" Nunes said on Fox News last month. ""It would also be dereliction of duty for me and my committee not to be meeting with Ukrainians.""Federal prosecutors might see things differently. They've already indicted Parnas, who was arrested in October while boarding a flight to Vienna with a one-way ticket. He is accused of using straw donors to hide campaign contributions to a pro-Trump super PAC and of helping funnel foreign money into US state elections. He has pleaded not guilty.That investigation continues and prosecutors said this week that additional charges are likely. CNN reported that investigators are probing Giuliani's financial ties to Parnas and his overseas dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere and have talked to witnesses and issued subpoenas.Prosecutors said they seized nearly 30 electronic devices from Parnas and his co-defendants and are still trying to crack the passwords. This would give investigators access to thousands of emails and text messages, perhaps including some communications with Nunes or Harvey.On Tuesday, Schiff sidestepped direct questions about Nunes' links to the Ukraine scheme. But while presenting the findings of his 300-page report, Schiff indirectly raised the alarm about Nunes' potential conduct.""It is deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival, that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity,"" Schiff said, alluding to his colleague Nunes.CNN's Olanma Mang and Kara Scannell contributed to this story."
Trump's former Russia ambassador: Putin is 'probably joyful' about claims of Ukraine meddling in 2016 election,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/jon-huntsman-vladimir-putin-probably-joyful-ukraine/index.html," (CNN)A former US ambassador to Russia said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""probably joyful"" about -- and may have enabled -- the conspiracy theory circulated by some Republicans that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 elections.""He's probably joyful that he has the world talking about something he may have been behind,"" former Ambassador Jon Huntsman told The Associated Press of Putin in an interview published Friday. ""That's the way they operate in Moscow, to try to sow seeds of discontent between the United States and Kiev.""The criticism from Huntsman, President Donald Trump's own nominee, comes as Trump and several of his allies have propagated the conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election as the impeachment inquiry into the President intensifies. Huntsman, who resigned in October, is not alone in pushing back on the Ukraine hypothesis. At least nine witnesses in the impeachment inquiry testified that claims of Ukrainian meddling in 2016 were fabricated by the Russians or unsupported by evidence. Others said they weren't aware of anything to corroborate these claims.But the unsupported assertions of Ukrainian involvement are widespread. House Republicans' report analyzing impeachment inquiry evidence thus far asserted that ""senior Ukrainian government officials worked in 2016 to support Secretary (Hillary) Clinton."" Claims of such a top-down effort by the Ukrainian government to defeat Trump are not supported by the evidence.The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had looked into allegations that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election and found no evidence to support the claims, sources familiar with the matter told CNN this week. Sources also told CNN that no US intelligence agency has ever produced a product accusing the Ukrainian government of interfering in the 2016 US election.Putin has been linked to efforts to stymie US-Ukraine cooperation before. The Washington Post reported in October that Trump's urging of Ukraine's President to investigate political rivals coincided with Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pushing a disparaging view of the country to Trump.When Trump asked Putin during a May call for his impressions of the new Ukrainian President, Putin said he had yet to speak with him but criticized him as a former comedian linked to a Kremlin-hated oligarch, a Western official familiar with the conversation told the Post. Trump and Putin also met during the G20 summit in June and spoke days after Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.CNN's  Tara Subramaniam, Marshall Cohen and Jake Tapper contributed to this report."
"'Make up your minds, whose side are you on?': Police chief rips McConnell and other Senate Republicans by name over gun violence",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/houston-police-chief-senate-republicans-gun-violence-vawa/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican lawmakers for not reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and taking action against gun violence, asking them in emotional remarks to choose between the nation's foremost gun lobby and ""the children that are getting gunned down in this country every single day.""Acevedo made his remarks to reporters Monday as the Houston Police Department prepared to escort the body of Sgt. Chris Brewster, an officer who died in the line of duty, to a funeral home. The 32-year-old was shot and killed while responding to a call with a team on Saturday.""I don't want to hear about how much they support law enforcement,"" Acevedo said. ""I don't want to hear about how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives yet, we all know in law enforcement that one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell and (Texas Sens.) John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House and getting the Violence Against Women's Act (passed) is because the NRA doesn't like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends. And who killed our sergeant? A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you're either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you're here for the (National Rifle Association).""He continued: ""So I don't want to see their little smug faces talking about how much they care about law enforcement when I'm burying a sergeant because they don't want to piss off the NRA. Make up your minds, whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers, the gun lobby, or the children that are getting gunned down in this country every single day."" Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994, has stalled in Congress. The bill provides grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault and domestic violence and prevention, among other things.In April, the House voted to reauthorize the act after it lapsed earlier this year. Democrats declined to extend it, wanting to pass their own reauthorization for another five years instead. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa had worked on a Senate version that aimed to be more bipartisan, but discussions fell apart. Last month, Ernst introduced her own version of the VAWA that extends the act by 10 years and Feinstein introduced a Senate version of the House bill.CNN has reached out McConnell for comment.A spokesman for Cruz said the congressman ""is currently reviewing Violence Against Women Act legislation in the Senate.""""For many years, Senator Cruz has worked in law enforcement, helping lead the fight to ensure that violent criminals -- and especially sexual predators who target women and children -- face the very strictest punishment,"" the spokesman also said in the email to CNN. Cornyn's office on Monday blamed Democrats for delayed action on the VAWA.""The Violence Against Women Act is still fully funded despite what the Chief implied. And he's got it backwards -- Democrats in DC walked away from negotiations and that's when it fell apart,"" Cornyn's office said in an email. They also pointed to Cornyn's remarks last month in which he said Democrats ""took the easy way out and simply walked away and introduced their own partisan reauthorization, one that they know has no chance of passing.""""Despite the games being played here, my Republican colleagues and I are working to put in the hard work that it takes to actually accomplish something and legislate,"" he said at the time.VAWA programs, though, are technically still being funded.Congress has also struggled to pass gun control legislation, even in the aftermath of mass shootings. Democrats have expressed frustration with McConnell for not pushing for gun control legislation and have called for immediate action.CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this story."
Trump and Saudi Arabia stay close after Pensacola shooting,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-pensacola-shooting/index.html,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump appears to be maintaining his support of Saudi Arabia in the wake of a deadly shooting at a US naval base allegedly perpetrated by a Saudi national -- a crime the FBI presumes is an act of terrorism. Last Friday, Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force and a student naval flight officer, opened fire in a classroom building at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, killing three sailors. Alshamrani was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him.Alshamrani's motive for the attack is still undetermined, but the FBI is operating with ""the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,"" as they do in most similar cases.The kingdom is often slow to offer official responses, especially on a Friday, which is considered the holiest day of the week in Saudi Arabia. But the same day of the shooting, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud spoke to Trump over the phone. He also quickly instructed his own security services to cooperate fully with US investigators. Lawyers from Saudi Arabia have also been sent to Florida. Trump relayed that the king's Friday message to him was that ""the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people.""And on Sunday, Trump spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. According to the White House's readout of the call, the prince ""reiterated Saudi Arabia's commitment to working with the United States to prevent a horrific attack like the Pensacola shooting from ever happening again. The President thanked the Crown Prince for Saudi Arabia's assistance with the investigation and continued partnership.""Adding to the Saudi response, a high-ranking Saudi defense attache is also traveling to Pensacola to meet with US officials involved in the shooting probe as tension between the countries is rising over the continued restriction to the base of up to a dozen Saudi nationals, a person familiar with the case said.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday confirmed one or two Saudi nationals filmed the Pensacola attack. It is not clear why they were filming it, he said. Esper said some Saudi friends of shooter  Alshamrani were detained after the incident, and that one or two of those friends filmed the attack.The Saudi nationals have been generally cooperating but have made requests to leave their confinement on the military base. The FBI said Sunday that they have been restricted to base by their Saudi commanding officer. Questions still remain about what they knew about the shooter, and whether they had any advance knowledge that an attack was coming, the source familiar with the case said. Despite major incidents seeming to highlight rising tensions in the last two years, leaders of the allied nations have appeared to stay close. Trump maintained support of Saudi Arabia even as details of the 2018 murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi emerged. Khashoggi was allegedly killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by men with close ties to the highest levels of the Saudi government and bin Salman.Although the CIA has concluded that the crown prince personally ordered Khashoggi's murder, Trump  signaled he would take strong action against Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, or its crown prince, despite pressure at home and internationally.And throughout his presidency, Trump has also highlighted his bond with the Saudis and praised their purchase of US weapons.Many of the weapons systems the kingdom purchases are made in the USA, from fighter jets to helicopters to machine guns. In recent years, the purchases have increased significantly as Saudi Arabia is now the world's third-largest defense and security spender, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.CNN has previously reported that some of these American-made weapons have been transferred to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias, and other factions at war in Yemen -- in violation of their agreements with the United States. Congress has tried to ban these types of weapons sales. Trump has vetoed these efforts.

Trump to 'temporarily hold off' declaring Mexican cartels terror organizations,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/politics/trump-cartels-delay-terror-designation/index.html," (CNN)President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will ""temporarily hold off"" designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations as he said he would last week.""All necessary work has been completed to declare Mexican Cartels terrorist organizations. Statutorily we are ready to do so,"" the President tweeted.But Trump said he would hold off the designation at the request of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he called ""a man who I like and respect, and has worked so well with us.""Marcelo Ebrard, the country's foreign minister, thanked Trump via his Twitter account for postponing the designation. CNN has reached out to López Obrador's office for comment.He wrote that the US and Mexico would ""step up our joint efforts to deal decisively with these vicious and ever-growing organizations!""Designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations could lead to tougher financial penalties and legal ramifications in the US against those involved.Trump told conservative radio host Bill O'Reilly last week that he would ""absolutely"" designate the cartels and ""start hitting them with drones and things like that."" ""I don't want to say what I'm going to do, but they will be designated,"" Trump said, adding that the US had offered the Mexican government ""to let us go in and clean it out and (the President of Mexico) so far has rejected the offer. But at some point, something has to be done.""The President did not specify last week which cartels would be targeted. He said designating cartels would be justified over ""losing 100,000 people a year"" from drugs coming into the US and human trafficking.CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report."
Federal judge rules American Samoans are US citizens by birth,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/american-samoa-citizenship/index.html,"""This court is not imposing 'citizenship by judicial fiat.' The action is required by the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment as construed and applied by Supreme Court precedent,"" wrote Judge Clark Waddoups in the US District Court for the District of Utah.""Further, Plaintiffs are American Samoans. They brought this action seeking to realize their rights to citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment,"" he added. It's unclear whether Waddoups' order applies to American Samoans beyond Utah. ""It's an overwhelming victory but it's the first step in what will likely be several more steps,"" said Neil Weare, attorney for the plaintiffs and the president and founder of the non-profit Equally American. In 2016, the Supreme Court declined to reconsider a ruling in a similar case from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the Constitution does not confer citizenship on those born in American Samoa. But the Utah district court isn't bound by the DC Circuit, allowing it to disagree, though it has the potential of creating a circuit split if a different court affirms the decision, according to Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.American Samoa has been a US territory since 1900. Those born in the other US territories -- Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Marianas -- all get citizenship at birth, but that was determined by statute in Congress. No such law exists for American Samoa.American Samoans living in Utah brought the suit in 2018, arguing that being ""non-citizen nationals,"" instead of US citizens closed the door to some employment opportunities and didn't allow them to vote, among other rights afforded to US citizens. Their passports also include a disclaimer that reads: ""The bearer is a United States national and not a United States citizen.""  ""It doesn't feel very good when the federal government says you're American, but not quite the same as other Americans, just a little bit different. Just being able to say they're real American citizens, I think that goes a long way, in addition to being able to vote,"" Weare said. The US Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling."
Trump is lining up new tariffs. Here's what they mean for you,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/tariffs-iphones-cheese-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN)Unless President Donald Trump backs down, Americans will soon be paying new tariffs on Chinese-made iPhones and toys, as well as French champagne and cheeses.Tariffs, which are paid by US importers, could lead to higher prices for consumers. One recent report said that Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods could cost the average American household $600 annually or -- if the next round goes into effect -- up to $1,000 a year.So far, most of Trump's tariffs have hit industrial goods -- but new tariffs set to go into place on December 15 would affect a variety of consumer products. Here's what to expect.iPhone tariff coming December 15Under Trump's current plans, about $155 billion of Chinese-made products will be hit with a new tariffs on December 15. On Monday Trump threw cold water on hopes that an agreement would be reached with Beijing before his deadline, suggesting it could be ""better to wait until after the election"" to make a deal. Cellphones, laptops and tablets made in China would be hit by this round of tariffs, as well as toys, office and schools supplies, Christmas ornaments, some clothing, and frozen Alaskan pollock fillets. But these tariffs aren't expected to hit holiday shoppers. Most of the items already on store shelves were shipped to the United States during the summer and fall, before the tariffs.  European wines and cheesesIn October, the United States imposed tariffs on $7.5 billions worth of goods produced in the European Union for a trade dispute over government subsides for aircraft maker Airbus. Those tariffs hit a variety of food and drinks, including meats and cheeses from Italy, French and Spanish wine, and Irish and Scotch whiskeys. More tariffs could be coming over the same subsidy issue. The World Trade Organization ruled this week that the EU still hadn't fixed the problem, so the Trump administration is weighing whether to increase the existing tariff rate and finding new products to tax. Meanwhile, French champagne could be next, along with an expanded array of cheeses, handbags and beauty products. The United States said Monday that it is considering tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products over an issue with a new French tax on digital services. But when meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, Trump struck a softer tone, saying the two leaders ""have a minor dispute"" but added, ""we'll probably be able to work it out."" What's already more expensive?Last year, Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made washing machines, which led to an a 12% price increase for US consumers, according to a report from economists at the University of Chicago and Federal ReserveChinese-made luggage, baseball hats and gloves and a variety of bikes were hit with tariffs last year. In September, TVs and apparel were also affected. But earlier Chinese tariffs were meant to spare American consumers, and mostly impacted industrial materials used by manufacturers.
