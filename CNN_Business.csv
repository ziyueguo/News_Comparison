Impossible Burgers debut at the grocery store,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/business/impossible-burgers-retail-gelsons/index.html,"New York  (CNN Business)Impossible Burgers will hit grocery shelves for the first time on Friday. The soy-based meat substitute will be sold at all 27 Gelson's Markets locations in Southern California, Impossible said Thursday. Later this month, the product will become available in grocery stores on the East Coast. Impossible is launching its retail product as the meatless meat sector starts to become more crowded. Plant-based protein company Beyond Meat (BYND) sells burger patties, sausages, crumbles and grounds at Safeway, Kroger, Shop Rite and other grocery stores. Kellogg (K) and Nestle (NSRGF) both have plant-based burger patties in the works. Kroger (KR), which is testing out a plant-based section in the meat aisle of some stores, recently announced that it is launching a line of meatless products, including meatless burger patties and deli slices, this fall. Even meat processors like Tyson (TSN) and Smithfield Foods are jumping on the trend. It's no surprise that big food companies and retail chains are entering the sector. Barclays predicts the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales over the next decade, capturing about 10% of the global meat industry.US retail sales of plant-based foods have grown 11% in the past year, according to a July report from trade group Plant Based Foods Association and the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses. Refrigerated plant-based burger patties, which have spiked 151% since 2018, have helped drive that growth, GFI noted. For Impossible, it was important to launch in restaurants before hitting grocery stores, CFO David Lee told CNN Business. The Impossible Burger debuted three years ago at Momofuku Nishi, a high-end restaurant in New York City owned by chef David Chang.""We wanted the benefit of building a consumer movement in the hands of professional chefs before we began to serve home chefs,"" Lee said.Today, the Impossible Burger is served at over 17,000 restaurants, including Burger King and White Castle. Impossible is hoping that the restaurant launches have made customers familiar enough with the product to reach for it in a grocery store. Gelson's will also offer promotions to help draw attention to the product, like free samples and cooking demos, at some stores starting in October. Now that the company is finally making its product directly available to shoppers, it's moving slowly. Impossible wants to ""test and learn before we fully commit to our rollout nationwide,"" Lee said. ""We want to learn how to best create the same degree of interest that we've seen in food service in a retail environment.""Impossible plans to use insights from Gelson's and from market researchers IRI and Nielsen to learn about how customers interact with the product, and figure out the best way to present it to shoppers in stores. It plans to make the Impossible Burger available in retail stores nationwide by the middle of next year. "
Steel company sells for less than half what it was worth when Trump took office,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/business/ak-steel-cleveland-cliff-deal/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Despite President Donald Trump's promise to revive the domestic steel industry through tariffs, AK Steel has decided its time to sell.The Ohio steelmaker agreed to be purchased by mining company Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) in a roughly $1 billion stock deal. Although it's a premium from AK Steel's recent valuation, that's less than half the stock's value from early 2018 after President Trump first announced he would place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in an effort to help those industries. It's roughly a third of the price of the stock the day he took office.The deal came the day after Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina.The Trump administration's original round of steel tariffs briefly led to a jump in domestic prices and increased American steel production. But prices have retreated since then as the increased production and decrease in demand put downward pressure on prices. Steel industry profits and stock prices have fallen along with the decline in prices. AK Steel recently reported a 96% drop in net income in the third quarter. In January it announced it would close a mill in Ashland, Kentucky, by the end of this year, cutting 230 jobs.But the deal offers new hope to AK Steel and its workers according to Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves. During a call with investors Tuesday he said the deal could allow the Ashland plant to reopen to produce pig iron, a steel component, at its blast furnaces. But he wouldn't give any firm date for restarting the mill, saying it would depend on discussions with possible customers.""It all depends on the clients,"" he said. ""We'd love to generate jobs there. But the clients need to understand that we don't work for free, and we have to earn our cost of capital.""Beyond the question of the Ashland mill's future, Goncalves vowed that the deal will make AK Steel far more profitable than it has been, both through refinancing its higher cost debt, cutting costs and having a supply of the iron ore pellets that Cleveland-Cliff produces. He noted that other steelmakers may continue to struggle, but the deal would give AK a competitive advantage in a troubled industry.""AK Steel is going to survive,"" he vowed. ""We believe this transaction is a compelling opportunity for AK Steel shareholders,"" said AK Steel CEO Roger Newport, whose retirement was announced as part of the deal.Stockholders of AK Steel (AKS) will get 0.4 shares of Cleveland-Cliff for each of their shares, worth about $3.36 at Monday's closing price. But Cleveland-Cliffs' stock tumbled 14% Tuesday on the news of the deal.  Goncalves, who has a history of battling with stock analysts during conference calls, dismissed the market reaction. ""Unfortunately, Wall Street sells first and thinks later,"" he said."
Family that owns Krispy Kreme announces $5 million donation to Holocaust survivors,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/krispy-kreme-family-nazi-donation-trnd/index.html,"The Reimann family, which owns a controlling stake in JAB Holdings, announced Thursday it's donating more than $5.5 million to Claims Conference, an organization that provides compensation payments to Holocaust survivors.   The donation will be administrated through the Reimann family's new Alfred Landecker Foundation over the next three years. The organization said the money is a ""significant step"" for them as it begins to provide financial and humanitarian assistance for Holocaust survivors. The Reimann family said they discovered in March that family members had strong anti-Semitic ties following a three-year investigation. A family spokesperson said Albert Reimann Sr., who died in 1954, and Albert Reimann Jr., who died in 1984, used Russian civilian prisoners and French prisoners of war as forced labor in their factories during World War II and that they were anti-Semites and avowed supporters of Adolf Hitler. A plant run by Reimann Jr. used 200 civilians as forced laborers in 1942, the investigation found.The investigation also found that Reimann Sr. donated to Hitler's paramilitary SS force as early as 1931. Investigators also found a letter from Reimann Jr. to a local mayor complaining that the French prisoners of war weren't working hard enough and should be in prison. The family previously said the crimes were ""disgusting"" and are ""nothing to gloss over."" Thursday's donation is part of a larger $11 million commitment the family plans to donate to Holocaust survivors. Landecker was killed by Nazis and was linked to the Reimann family, it said in a press release.The Reimann's said it was using Landecker's name to ""not only preserve his memory, but also memorialize the murder of millions of Jews and other victims of National Socialism.""Privately held JAB Holdings is based in Luxembourg and also owns Peet's Coffee, Pret A Manger, Einstein's Bagels and Coty. The Reimann family is reportedly one of the richest families in Germany. The company acquired most of its best-known brands within the last several years. It took a stake in Coty in the early 1990s, and is the beauty company's largest shareholder.--CNN Business Chris Isidore contributed to this report."

She is a stay-at-home mom in Detroit. And in her free time, she runs Aldi Nerd, a blog about the discount German grocery chain that has 1,600 US stores. She also has an Aldi fan group on Facebook with nearly a half million members. ""There's a lot of Aldi nerds out there,"" Youngpeter said. ""I don't know if I can handle any more people in my Facebook group."" Aldi doesn't pay Youngpeter for her content about her favorite brands at the storeâ€” Girl Scout cookies knockoffs and German chocolates. But she and other grocery store superfans with Facebook and Instagram accounts dedicated to the stores are powerful advocates for the companies. They bring authenticity, create loyal shoppers and build an internet culture around the brands, experts say.Aldi is not the only big grocer with pages run by die-hard customers.Kroger Krazy lifts Kroger. An Instagram account called  Costco_doesitagain has 511,000 followers. Then there's Trader Joe's List, Trader Joe's Obsessed and a lineup of Trader Joe's influencers with no connection to the company.  I Heart Publix, a Facebook page started by Michelle Atwood more than a decade ago, has grown to 116,000 followers.With more consumers cutting the cord on television, coupons in magazines fading away and the efficacy of celebrities' paid social media ads waning, these passionate fans on social media are becoming more important to reach shoppers, experts say.""The typical ways in which consumers have been approached by grocery retailers and brands is increasingly losing relevancy,""  said Melissa Abbott, vice president of culinary insights at the Hartman Group, a food and beverage research firm. Consumers are responding to ""influencers that are out there being very honest and raw and vulnerable.""These everyday superfans generate excitement about the stores on their pages and deliver a sense of urgency to shop to their army of followers. Celebrity partnerships and posts from companies' own social media accounts can't match that because shoppers tend to distrust them, according to experts.""The biggest criticism about influencer marketing is that it's not authentic. It's just people getting paid,"" said Evan Asano, founder of Mediakix, an influencer marketing agency. Grocery superfans with their own pages are a ""dream scenario"" for companies and a form of earned media. ""Earned media is the best type of media because it's people choosing to post on behalf of the brand,"" he said.

Adidas is partnering with the International Space Station to test products in space,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/business/adidas-iss-scn-trnd/index.html,"The apparel company is launching a multi-year partnership with the International Space Station (ISS) US National Laboratory.""The partnership was formed because of the shared focus on innovation between Adidas and the ISS US National Lab and our joint dedication to Open Source creation,"" said James Carnes, vice president of global brand strategy for Adidas. ""The initial conversations led to the idea of maximizing the unique lab characteristics of the International Space Station, like microgravity, for product research with our background in human performance for athletes.""Phase oneThe first phase of the partnership will focus on product innovation by testing products in microgravity. Microgravity is the condition in which people or objects appear to be weightless, according to NASA.Adidas delivered soccer balls to the ISS during a cargo mission earlier this year in order to run experiments in an attempt to extend the understanding of flight characteristics beyond Earth. ""The unique conditions of space provide the ideal environment to discover the unknown,"" said Christine Kretz, vice president of Program and Partnerships of the International Space Station US National Laboratory. ""For example, microgravity is the only condition in which we can observe specific experiments like the behavior of a spinning soccer ball without interrupting airflow and external supports holding it in place. Having control of certain variables allows us to conduct tests and collect insights that aren't possible on Earth.""Without gravity distorting the shape and flight path of the ball and air resistance affecting the ball's flight spin, researchers are able to concentrate on testing other variables.Adidas may be able to incorporate what they learn from these tests into the design of the panel shape of the ball, the surface and texture design, and the material to engineer future balls.Carnes said that as the first test of its kind on sports equipment, the company is still processing the test results for the ball. And they already have a different test planned.First to spaceAdidas will be the first brand to test improvements to footwear in space. The company plans to test its Boost technology, which is the foam the company uses to cushion some of its most popular and comfortable shoes, without the distraction of gravity. This could influence the performance and comfort of existing models while paving the way for innovation of new products.""Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, extreme conditions in microgravity and temperature allow for unique exploratory testing that can only be achieved in space,"" said Carnes. ""This will manifest itself in technology and process innovations for how we make sneakers, advancements in apparel like compression garments, extreme temperature management of both footwear and apparel, and pioneering sustainable materials and circular processes.""The tests are slated to begin early next year, and astronauts will experiment in order to test if it's possible to produce Boost midsoles with regions of different particle sizes, which Adidas says could theoretically optimize performance and comfort.""We know that the space-based environment of the orbiting laboratory promotes profound changes that affect all scientific disciplines,"" Kretz said. ""What is exciting about this collaboration is the targeted nature of Adidas' research with its Boost technology. What they learn could have very near-term impacts on the company's future product lines that could benefit athletes all over the world.""Pushing the boundaries of human performanceAdidas said it plans to research human performance and sustainability through the physical training regimen developed for astronauts.Astronauts must undergo a rigorous training program in order to prepare for the harsh conditions of space, and Adidas hopes to improve endurance and strength training by studying the conditions required to prepare for space travel. The company also plans to explore the range of motion in the human body and how muscle development and atrophy are affected without gravity.""This will have an impact on how we design and develop things like compression apparel for muscle enhancement and recovery,"" Carnes said. ""We are also inspired by the recent increase of women astronauts joining space programs, which could potentially enable exploration with a balanced look at specific biomechanical movements of both men and women throughout the entire journey.""Adidas hopes to use this information to help athletes better prepare, perform and recover.SustainabilityAdidas has made a commitment to being environmentally friendly. The company has a long-running partnership with the organization Parley, which focuses on recycling ocean plastics and using them to create apparel and sneakers.The company also recently launched the Adidas Futurecraft Loop, which is the company's first recyclable shoe.Now the company hopes its partnership with the ISS will yield takeaways for more sustainable manufacturing.Carnes said that Adidas hopes to ""pioneer a whole new approach to sustainability that can only happen in conditions where every gram of material needs to be accounted for, reused, or repurposed.""""At Adidas, we believe that through sport we have the power to change lives, and we want to learn how to make sport accessible to everyone, wherever humanity goes -- Earth, space and beyond,"" Carnes said."
"Larry Summers: Trump's trade war is a 'Stop, or I'll shoot myself in the foot' strategy",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/business/larry-summers-trade-war-trump/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says President Donald Trump's love affair with tariffs is backfiring. And he's not surprised at all. Breaking from decades of US presidents lowering trade barriers, Trump is waging a global trade war that spread this week to Argentina, Brazil and France. Trump's tariffs are aimed at protecting American workers, but Summers argues it's the US economy that will suffer.""We are engaged in a stop or I'll shoot myself in the foot strategy,"" Summers told CNN Business. ""It's hard to know just how adverse the impact will be. But the direction is clear.""Summers, who served in the Clinton and Obama White Houses, said tariffs will hurt the competitiveness of US producers that rely on imported goods. That includes everything from car makers to wine distributors. Summers said this will lead to higher prices and lower incomes for American consumers.Already, the US manufacturing industry is in recession. Factory activity contracted in November for the fourth month in a row. The downturn is being driven by trade tensions as well as weak global growth, which the trade war is exacerbating. US manufacturing jobs declined by 6,000 in November, according to ADP. The factory job losses contributed to the second weakest private sector payroll growth since March 2010.""Uncertainty can paralyze economic activity,"" Summers said. Trade wars aren't easy to winSummers knows firsthand. He was a top Treasury official in the late 1990s during the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. Later, he advised President Barack Obama during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Trump famously declared in March 2018 that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" Nearly two years later, it's clear that hasn't been the case. The United States and China are bogged down in a trade war and Trump suggested this week that a preliminary agreement may not happen until after the 2020 election.""Ronald Reagan's statement about nuclear war is the more accurate presidential statement about trade wars: They can never be won and should never be fought,"" Summers said, paraphrasing the former Republican president's 1984 State of the Union address. Yet trade wars are being fought, posing a risk to the longest economic expansion in American history. ""Trade uncertainty continues to be a black cloud for business investment,"" David Tesher, managing director at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in a report Tuesday. S&P sees a 25% to 30% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, although that's an improvement from the firm's previous call. ""We are 10 years into recovery with optimistic asset markets,"" Summers said, referring to the recent string of records in the US stock market. ""We are at a complex moment. Things are more fragile because of our trade war with the world.""Summers: Markets could 'fall a long way' from record highsUS stocks experienced a melt-up that began in early October, catapulting the S&P 500 to 11 record highs in November alone. That powerful advance was driven by easy money from the Federal Reserve, hints of stabilization in the US economy and hopes of a preliminary trade agreement with China.""Markets are at levels where they could possibly fall a long way. That makes the moment riskier than a normal moment,"" Summers said. US stocks fell sharply on Monday and Tuesday as trade tensions erupted again. Trump announced plans Monday to lob tariffs on steel imports from Brazil and Argentina. And the administration threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on French champagne, handbags and cheese. Trump officials also signaled the trade war with China could get worse. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC that the United States has more ""ammunition"" left against China. He warned that the December 15 tariffs on consumer-facing imports from China will take effect ""unless there is some reason to postpone them.""The aggressive stance against China is aimed at addressing legitimate and serious grievances with the country's trade tactics. China's alleged theft of intellectual property, for instance, has damaged US businesses and cost jobs. But there is concern about Trump's use of tariffs as a tool to gain concessions in trade talks. ""He has really instilled a dramatic loss in confidence in the US economic policy apparatus being pro-growth,"" said Harry Broadman, who served as an economic adviser to former President George HW Bush. Negative rates can lead to cash hoardingInvestors would look to the Federal Reserve to mitigate the damage caused by a potential escalation of the trade war with China. However, Summers is concerned that the Fed's recession-fighting toolkit is limited by the fact that interest rates are already low. The October rate cut, the Fed's third in a row, left the federal funds rate at a range of just 1.5% to 1.75%.""The whole economic system is brittle in a way without precedence in decades, because the normal response to economic difficulty, the Fed reducing interest rates by 500 basis points, is not close to possible right now,"" Summers said.Cutting rates by five percentage points would leave the Fed with deeply negative rates. Trump has urged the Fed to adopt the subzero rate strategy implemented by central bankers in Europe and Japan. ""Give me some of that money. I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn't let us do it,"" Trump said of negative rates during a speech last month.But negative rates have failed to revive the economies of Europe and Japan. And extremely negative rates could encourage households to hoard cash, rather than spend it. ""They can't go that negative because people hold currency under the mattress,"" Summers said.  "
Using machine learning to make work 'suck a little less',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/business/citrix-machine-learning/index.html,"Workers are bombarded with a steady stream of emails, instant messages and requirements to log onto different systems to do such basic tasks as requesting vacation and filing expense reports.Citrix Systems (CTXS), which makes workplace platforms used by about 100 million people every day, is trying to improve the office technology experience by bringing a Facebook-like newsfeed to your work computer and smartphone.Citrix told CNN Business it will soon launch an Intelligent Digital Workspace that uses machine learning to aggregate information from dozens of outside apps into a single place. The product is getting rolled out as an update to the existing Citrix Workspace. ""There are just too many applications. We're constantly getting notifications that are interrupting our work.""  said Alysia Eve, senior manager of product marketing at Citrix. ""We've designed a space that is aimed at cutting out that digital noise and those distractions -- and make work suck a little less,""""By integrating with dozens of Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google and Salesforce (CRM) apps, the workspace will allow workers to complete such routine tasks as approving contracts, registering for training courses and submitting purchase orders directly from their newsfeeds. They won't need to log onto (or even and remember the passwords to) those outside systems. Citrix said its machine learning technology will help automate certain tasks and anticipate others. The newsfeed will include meeting reminders, pop-up notifications about new hires and information about vacation requests. Managers can dive into expense reports and accept or reject them without leaving the system. ""The newsfeed is how we are used to consuming information in our personal lives,"" Eve said. The company plans to begin releasing the new version of Workspace this month to some of its hundreds of thousands of medium and large enterprise customers. Most of those companies won't get charged more for the changes.""Our strategy is to bring together the right information and unlock human potential by removing the complexity that comes with technology,"" Citrix CEO David Henshall told CNN Business in an exclusive interview.Of course, there is no guarantee the new digital workspace will be a hit with customers and worth the investment by Citrix. It also will face competition from other systems in this space, such as those sold by Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and VMware (VMW), although Citrix said its product stands out because of the ability to deeply integrate dozens of apps and link them all in one place. Henshall said he will measure success by how many new active users the company draws. The Intelligent Digital Workspace is a key part of Citrix's pivot towards a subscription-based business model that focuses more on recurring revenue. Subscription revenue soared 43% during the third quarter, although total revenue was flat. Despite surveys showing that CEO confidence is down, Citrix said Corporate America continues to invest heavily in technology. ""There is a lot of money being spent still, it's just being allocated to the most strategic products,"" Henshall said. ""We're fortunate enough that we're aligned with areas like security and mobility that are high on the priority list."""
Retailers are scrambling to find holiday help,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/business/retailers-holiday-help/index.html," (CNN)If you're looking for a store employee to help you out while shopping this holiday season, you're not alone. Retailers themselves are having a lot of trouble finding the help they need.With unemployment rate so low, retailers are scrambling to find workers. They're raising pay and benefits over what was offered in the past, sometimes substantially. And they started looking for seasonal help much earlier than normal.""We've heard a lot about firms looking for people in July and August for holiday hiring,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation.Still, with the national unemployment rate matching a 50-year low, many retailers are having to get by with fewer seasonal workers than in the past. The NRF estimates that total seasonal hiring will be between 530,000 to 590,000.That may sound like a lot, but it could be the fewest number of seasonal workers hired by retailers since the Great Recession ended in 2009 -- down as much as 30% from where holiday hiring stood in 2013, according to the NRF.As traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle to compete with the trend of shoppers doing more of their holiday purchases online, not being able to find help is a serious problem.""You need sales associates who can make the trip to the store worthwhile for the shoppers,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner for the consumer and retail practice at consultant A.T. Kearney. ""If you're taking time to go to the store, the retailer needs to make that a good experience. The people in the store are critical.""The biggest problem is that with the low overall unemployment, there aren't many unemployed retail workers looking for work, despite the record number of store closings. The Labor Department reports that workers who last worked in retail and were looking for work in November stood at 3.5%. That is the lowest reading ever for that measure in data that goes back to 2000. Retail work, particularly over the holidays, is tough work, with late hours, physical labor and being on your feet for much of a shift.Portell said retailers are using signing bonuses and offering referral bonuses to existing employees who can suggest someone willing to take a seasonal job.""Some may have tried them in the past, but they're becoming much more common, much larger dollar amounts,"" said Portell about the bonuses.To be sure, some of the drop in hiring is due to the closing of stores and retailers using technology to reduce the demand for labor -- self-checkout lanes, more efficient inventory management, even robot janitors. Matt Katz, head of the retail & consumer practice of consultant SSA & Company, said some retailers have raised the pay of temporary workers as much as 20% compared to last year. He said the more typical increase has been 5% to 7% increases annually over the last five years. And there are other inducements that used to be reserved for permanent employees, including employee discounts on purchases and other benefits.""I've even seen tuition reimbursements,"" he said.Walmart (WMT), the nation's largest business employer, has moved away from hiring temporary workers and is filling its staffing needs by giving extra hours to the permanent employees it uses year round.""It has worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive,"" said Walmart spokesperson Michelle Malashock."
Boeing records first 737 Max orders since grounding,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/boeing-737-max-orders/index.html,"At the Dubai Airshow Tuesday, Boeing (BA) announced an order for 20 of the jets from an unidentified airline -- 10 of the 737 Max 7 version of the plane, and 10 of the larger Max 10 jet that is still in development. The Max 10 is expected to hold between 188 and 204 passengers, or roughly one-third more than a 737 Max 7.The company also announced Monday that it received an order for an additional 10 Max 8 planes from SunExpress, an airline jointly owned by Lufthansa and Turkey that specializes in travel between Europe and Turkey. The airline already had orders for 32 Max jets, and its new order exercises an option it had for additional jets.The SunExpress purchase provides a vote of confidence for a plane model that has been grounded since March following the second of two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.""We have a longstanding, strong and trustful relationship with Boeing and thus we decided to turn our option into an order,"" says SunExpress CEO Jens Bischof. ""We have full confidence that Boeing will deliver us a safe, reliable, and efficient aircraft.""The orders are fairly modest, and for far fewer planes than a much larger order that rival Airbus (EADSF) announced at the same show. Airbus announced firm orders from Air Arabia for 120 of the A320 class of jets, the rival of the 737 Max. Airbus also reported Tuesday it sold 20 long-range A321 planes to the leasing arm of General Electric (GE), and 10 of them to Flynas, a low-cost airline based in Saudi Arabia. And EasyJet announced it had exercised the rights to buy 12 more A320neo jets.The list price of the 120 single-aisle jets Airbus sold to Air Arabia is $14 billion, while the 30 737 Max jets that Boeing sold have a list price of $3.5 billion.Boeing also announced that Kazakhstan carrier Air Astana signed a letter of intent to buy 30 of the 737 Max jets for use at its new low-cost offering, FlyArystan. ""We believe that the Max will provide a solid platform for the growth of FlyArystan throughout our region, once the aircraft has successfully returned to service.""A letter of intent is not a firm order. In June at the Paris Air Show, International Airlines Group, the owner of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia and other European carriers, signed a letter of intent to buy 200 of the 737 Max jets, but that order has yet to result in any firm orders.Still, as Boeing continues to struggle to get approval for the 737 Max to fly again and to start deliveries of the planes it has built since the grounding, a sales announcement of any kind qualifies as good news.""It's a small endorsement, but at this point any airline endorsement is useful for Boeing,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group.But Boeing's struggles at Dubai haven't been limited to Airbus beating it soundly in the sale of single-aisle jets. Airbus also announced a $16 billion transaction to sell 50 A350 widebody jets to Dubai-based Emirates. That deal is worth $16 billion. And it sold an additional 12 of the widebody A330 jets to GE.Boeing had trailed Airbus in the sale of single-aisle jets even before the 737 Max crashes, but it led in sales of more expensive, more profitable widebody jets. In Dubai its widebody sales were modest as well, as it sold only two 787 Dreamliners to Biman Bangladesh Airlines at a list price of $585 million for the two jets. In addition, EgyptAir announced it would lease two additional Dreamliners from leasing company AerCap."
Pepsi's new product has nearly twice as much caffeine as its regular soda,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/pepsi-cafe-coffee-cola/index.html,"Pepsi CafÃ©, which also comes in a vanilla flavor, will hit shelves throughout the United States in April for a limited time. It's nearly twice as caffeinated as a regular soda. For Pepsi, the new beverage is a way to leverage consumer trends to invigorate its core product, which could certainly use a boost. ""Cola has been a pretty stagnant category over the last 20-30 years,"" said Todd Kaplan, vice president of marketing for Pepsi. ""As consumer preferences continue to evolve, we as Pepsi need to evolve as well to better meet those needs.""  While cola remains flat, other types of beverages are gaining traction. Consumers are increasingly interested in functional beverages, which offer a nutritional benefit or a boost of energy. Ready-to-drink iced coffees also are growing. And people are embracing mixed beverage categories. White Claw is an example of a successful product that blurs beverages, seltzer and alcohol, with sales that are expected to surpass $1.5 billion this year.Pepsi previously tried to get consumers on board with coffee colas. In the nineties it tested a coffee product called Pepsi Kona, and in the mid-aughts it briefly marketed another called Pepsi Max Cino. Those products didn't take off, but now Pepsi thinks the time is right for a new version of the product. ""We think the consumers today have now caught up with this trend,"" Kaplan said. When consumers tested out the new version, they were ""quite surprised about the synergy between cola and coffee,"" said Danielle Barbaro, director of research and development at PepsiCo. ""Once they tasted it, they saw that the flavors really blended."" Barbaro called the recipe ""cola forward,"" with an ""authentic, coffee flavor to finish."" The vanilla flavor is designed to offer a milkier, more latte-like taste. Pepsi didn't disclose how much the product will cost.Pepsi (PEP) may also benefit from Coca-Cola's (KO) efforts to market its own coffee cola. Coke â€” which also briefly sold a coffee cola, Coca-Cola Blak, in the 2000s â€” recently brought back a new version of the product. Coca-Cola With Coffee, or Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, is currently available in several international markets, where it has performed well, according to the company. Coke hopes to eventually bring the product to the United States, but hasn't committed to doing so. Pepsi, however, isn't ready to go all in on coffee cola quite yet.""The concept of cola infused with coffee, for people to initially wrap their head around until they try it, it's gonna take some time to catch on,"" Kaplan said. Still, he added, ""we think there's a real market there."""
Taco Bell now has a vegetarian menu,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/business/taco-bell-vegetarian-menu/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Taco Bell is debuting a vegetarian section on its newly redesigned menu, which also includes two new items.Beginning Thursday, the fast food chain will offer two new vegetarian items: a Black Bean Crunchwrap Supreme and a Black Bean Quesarito. Those are in addition to its two other existing vegetarian options that will be displayed prominently in a new ""Vegetarian Favorites"" menu.With customers becoming more health conscious, the changes makes it easier for vegetarians to see their options, the Yum Brands-owned company previously explainedThe nationwide expansion of the new menu items to Taco Bell's 7,000 US restaurants comes after a test earlier this year. It's also planning a new advertising campaign to promote the new section.In total, there are more than a dozen vegetarian items on Taco Bell's menu. They will feature a new green emblem that shows off Taco Bell's American Vegetarian Association certification. It be came the first and only quick service chain to receive the certification in 2015.Taco Bell emphasized that non-vegetarian items can be made vegetarian by substituting beans for meat. The chain said that its menu items ""can be customized more than 8 million ways"" to fit a vegetarian diet.Noticeably absent from the menu are any products featuring alternative meats from Impossible or Beyond Meat. KFC, which is also owned by Yum Brands (YUM), tested out a Beyond Meat's new plant-based chicken in Georgia. Plant-based meat alternatives have grown popular in supermarkets and restaurants across the world, as people search for environmentally friendly and healthier foods to eat. Taco Bell said in a release said it plans to ""further innovate in this growing space."" Other companies are trying to capitalize on diet-based resolutions. Chipotle (CMG) launched ""lifestyle bowls,"" a new collection of meals that fit into paleo, ketogenic and Whole30 diets. Burger King began selling the Impossible Whopper, featuring a meatless patty, nationwide in August. Perhaps encroaching on Taco Bell's territory, Burger King is also selling $1 tacos."
Tupperware goes high-end with $25 straws and $15 apple savers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/business/tupperware-store-soho-turnaround/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Tucked away on a street in New York's trendy SoHo neighborhood, a throng of bubbly influencers giggled and posed for selfies. A DJ played pulsating music amid a sea of neon lights and colorful walls that were expertly curated for Instagram. And, of course, there was alcohol and hors d'oeuvres were passed around.The scene is typical for any party or new store opening, but the event wasn't to celebrate a buzzy startup. Instead, it was for Tupperware (TUP), the stodgy 73-year-old plastic container maker that has fallen on hard times. Shares are down more than 70% this year. Tupperware is operating without a leader because its most recent CEO, Tricia Stitzel, left the company last month after less than two years in charge. It has reported a string of dismal earnings this year that missed expectations, partially because of the global trade war, a strong US dollar and customers seeking out cheaper alternatives. The model of relying on direct sales for buying Tupperware has also hampered growth. Although it's not eliminating the cultural staple, the brand hopes the new pop-up store, called TuppSoho, and a relaunched website will help turn it around. ""We've been relevant for 70 years, but we haven't connected to all of our consumers, and this is a great step in theÂ right direction of accessing more people,"" Tupperware's chief financial officer Sandra Harris told CNN Business at a press event Tuesday. The brand hopes the vibrant pop-up store, which closes on December 22, will attract people walking by and reconnect them with the brand. Tupperware is trying to get recognized beyond just being storage for leftovers. The store features new luxury cookware, a $40 cold brew carafe, a $15 apple keeper and a $25 reusable straw. The latter isn't available in catalogs or online: It's sold exclusively at the store. TuppSoho joins a growing and crowded neighborhood full of pop-up stores from fledgling brands employing the same strategy: Instagrammable experiences that generate free online publicity to expand their consumer bases. Shoe company Allbirds, mattress maker Casper, makeup brand Glossier and even Amazon (AMZN) have all launched with pop-up stores before opening permanent presences. Harris called the pop-up store a ""great learning opportunity"" for Tupperware because the company can study how the consumer interacts with the brand. She also hopes the nostalgia factor of the brand will give it a boost. ""The ability to show that the product is still here and still available for a whole new generation to experience this,"" she said. Tupperware's brand is based on plastic, a material that's falling out of favor. But Harris said that Tupperware's durability is an alternative to single-use plastic because it's made out of a stronger resin than its competitors. ""People recognize that Tupperware is different and it's here for forever,"" Harris said. ""The ability for consumers to connect that they can buy something that is plastic but helps to reduce footprint and use of single-use plastics gets consumers excited.""Harris acknowledged that it's a ""pivotal moment"" for the company as it faces an uneasy outlook. She called the pop-up and relaunched website a ""step in the right direction"" to attracting new consumers. "
Why Millennials and GenZers love going to the bank,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/business/bank-branches-millennials-adobe/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)America's banks have rapidly shut down branches over the past decade to slash costs and adapt to a world in which deposits can be made on smartphones.  The number of US bank branches has shrunk by more than 3,000 since 2010, according to Deloitte. Bank of America (BAC) alone has slashed its branch count by more than 1,400. Not only does the shift away from physical branches save banks money, it makes sense given how much younger Americans rely on their smartphones for daily life.  Yet new research suggests banks should think twice before they shut down their next bank branch: Many customers, especially younger ones, still regularly rely on physical banks to make deposits, get paper money and even pay bills.  Seventy-two percent of GenZ consumers visit a physical bank branch at least monthly, the highest of any age group, according to a study of 1,000 consumers by Adobe Analytics shared exclusively with CNN Business. And 60% of Millennials say the same. Surprisingly, older Americans were less likely to visit physical banks monthly, with GenX (50%), boomers (55%) and traditionalists (58%) saying they did so.  ""The death of retail branches is greatly exaggerated,"" Nate Smith, group manager at Adobe Analytics, told CNN Business. ""That personal interaction is still very, very important today."" Smith compared the findings with the realization that many shoppers still value brick-and-mortar stores for returns and trying on clothes. Why are younger Americans going to bank branches? Forty-five percent of GenZ consumers said it was to make deposits, followed by paying bills (28%) and to get face-to-face customer service (25%). The Adobe research also said GenZ and Millennials are going to the bank to get documents notarized and to apply for mortgages and other loans.The study found that all age groups agree that physical branches are an important part of the banking experience. Not surprisingly, that importance is most evident among older generations: 70% of GenX, 83% of boomers and 92% of traditionalists. Still, two-thirds of GenZ consumers and 68% of Millennials said physical branches are an important part of the banking experience, according to Adobe.  ""It's important for banks not to overcorrect and not to forget that people like to interact face to face,"" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.Banks shouldn't 'give up' on branchesCustomers especially prefer face-to-face interactions when opening new accounts.  A Deloitte survey released earlier this year found that bank branches are the preferred method among US consumers for applying for mortgages (65%), wealth management accounts (62%) and checking accounts (58%).  ""Banks should not completely give up on branches yet,"" Deloitte consultants wrote in the report. ""Customers still prefer the human touch."" Yet banks have substantially slimmed down their branch networks in recent years because of pressure to cut costs in a low-interest-rate environment and because of the popularity of mobile banking. The rise of payment platforms like Venmo and mobile check depositing has lessened the need to go to banks everyday.  Bank of America operated 4,302 branches across the United States as of the end the third quarter. That's down from 5,700 at the end of 2011. And yet over that span the bank's deposit base has grown 35% over that timeframe to nearly $1.4 trillion.  Wells Fargo's (WFC) branch count has dropped by 804, or 13%, since the end of 2012. That's partially because a majority of Wells Fargo's customer interactions now happen through its digital channels. Wells Fargo shut down 300 branches last year alone in addition to selling all 52 of its locations in three Midwestern states.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is shifting in the other direction: Last year marked the first in nearly a decade that Chase extended its presence in several states by opening new Chase branches.  Many younger Americans don't seem ready to embrace online-only banks. Less than half of GenZ (42%) and Millennials (49%) would consider online-only banks with no physical branches, Adobe found.  Chat bots and Amazon AlexaAlthough banks have shut down countless branches, they are investing heavily in emerging technology to improve the customer experience. For example, banks have rolled out artificial-intelligence-assisted chat bots and voice skills apps on home speakers like Amazon (AMZN) Alexa that can answer questions, perform simple tasks and point customers in the right direction.  Those investments seem to be paying off, especially with younger customers.  Among those who have interacted with chat bots, the Adobe study found that two-thirds of GenZ and 53% of Millennials found the bot experience to be better than interacting with a human representative.  ""There is a nefarious notion associated with AI and machine learning. We're seeing that's not the case,"" said Adobe's Smith. However, customers still want to deal with a real person when it comes to complex issues.  When asked about customer service needs, just 21% of GenZ and 23% of Millennials prefer bots over humans. "
Why the Fed may need to slash rates to zero before the end of 2020,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/fed-rate-cuts-recession/index.html,"After three straight rate cuts, the US central bank on Wednesday said rates are at ""appropriate"" levels to keep the longest economic expansion in history humming.  A wide majority of Fed officials anticipate holding rates steady until 2021 -- or later. Fed chief Jerome Powell said it would take a ""material reassessment"" of the central bank's economic outlook for that to change. ""The Fed is on course to do nothing for the foreseeable future,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients.That thinking makes sense. Recession fears have eased. Hiring has rebounded. The trade war could be cooling off. And US stocks are once again sitting at all-time highs. But what if the consensus is wrong? That's what happened in 2018 when the most economists expected the Fed would raise rates three or even four times this year. Instead, Powell & Co. reversed course and suddenly slashed rates to boost the economy.Rabobank, a Dutch bank that was prescient in predicting that Fed reversal, is now warning that the central bank's work is not even close to done.""The Fed thinks it has everything under control,"" Philip Marey, Rabobank's senior US strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.But the same forecasting model that led Rabobank to correctly pinpoint the end of the Fed's recent rate hiking cycle is now signaling that the central bank will need to ""cut rates all the way back to zero before the end of 2020,"" Marey said.""The three insurance cuts [this year] will not be enough to prevent the economy from sliding into a recession,"" he wrote. ""While the Fed is still convinced that they have made a mid-cycle adjustment, we think that it is more likely that we are late in the cycle.""Rabobank predicts the Fed will keep rates steady at the current range of 1.5% to 1.75% until April. That's when the firm anticipates that the Fed  will launch the first of six-straight ""recession"" cuts.To be sure, this is a contrarian call. And it could prove to be very wrong, especially if the trade war between the United States and China starts to fizzle out. US stocks rallied on Thursday on news that the two sides had agreed in principle to a preliminary trade deal.  ""Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China,""  President Donald Trump tweeted.Even without a trade deal, Goldman Sachs expects the US economy will accelerate in 2020, driving the unemployment rate below 3.3%. Bank of America said the Fed is signaling a ""long pause."" Markets are pricing in just a 15% chance that the Fed will cut rates more than once in 2020, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors are signaling there in no chance of rates dropping to zero. Rabobank's Marey isn't convinced. ""We have been here before,"" he said. "
The Santa Claus business is booming,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/mall-santas/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Retailers looking to get Americans off e-commerce sites and into physical stores this holiday season may be relying on Santa Claus more than ever.Department stores, such as Kohl's (KSS), have struggled to bring post-Thanksgiving shoppers into their brick-and-mortar locations so far this year. A handful of big-box behemoths, including Walmart (WMT), Target (CBDY) and Best Buy (BBY), gobbled up the lion's share of the record 190 million shoppers in physical stores during the Friday-to-Monday sales rush, according to the National Retail Federation.Online shopping has eclipsed purchases in physical stores for the past few years, so malls and department store chains are increasingly marketing photos with Santa to get customers to come to their stores. ""We can't go on Amazon and put our child on Amazon's knee and put a beard on it,"" said Amanda Nicholson, professor of retail practice at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management. ""Getting your child's photo with Santa is a generational thing to do. It's a compelling reason for malls to do it.""Nicholson said Millennial audiences value spending money on experiences more than purchasing consumer goods. That's why mall Santas and related attractions are some of the few remaining advantages that physical stores have over digital marketplace giants like Amazon.As a result, Santa is in higher demand this year.""We can never fulfill all the requests we're getting just because we don't have enough Santas,"" Megan Price, director of customer experience at GigSalad, a digital platform used to book entertainers for private parties and events, told CNN Business. The online company, which was founded in 2007, offers more than 600 categories for entertainment and event services. The company said Santa is its most-requested attraction by far. GigSalad's confirmed bookings for Santa have risen 128% over the last four years, according to Price.The bulk of the company's clients are women ages 25 to 50 looking to book a Santa for family or community holiday parties, usually at a rate of about $200 an hour. Corporate clients, including Boost Mobile and Nordstrom (JWN), have also used the site and its smartphone app to book appearances at stores and events across the country.""The number of Santas we have on the site has grown about 102% over the last four years,' Price said. ""People come every year and say they want to book a Santa. Usually we run out fairly quickly.""Santas are big moneySantas earn anywhere from $4,000 to $5,000 total for store and mall appearances during the holidays, according to Santa performer Ed Taylor, owner and operator of the Santa Claus Conservatory, an online school for Santas.""There's these amazing black swan malls out there busy from morning to night,"" Taylor told CNN Business. ""They have Santa houses, photos, videos for the families. It becomes essentially a destination.""One such venue is Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey, which unveiled its Santa's Flight Academy promotion once again on November 7. The colorful 3,000-square-foot holiday-themed playland lets children take pictures with Santa, try on virtual flight suits, interact with Santa's sleigh, and participate in a snowfall dance party.From Thursday through December 24, the American Dream mega mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey is transforming part of its space into a ""winter wonderland"" where parents and their children can take photos with Santa for free.Macy's stores in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia have continued their own ""Santaland"" promotions again this year, a tradition that started at the company's famed 34th Street Manhattan location in 1980."
Braves stadium to be renamed after bank no one has heard of,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/atlanta-braves-stadium-name-change/index.html,"The name of SunTrust Park, the home of the Braves, will change to include the oft-ridiculed ""Truist"" brand, the newly-merged bank confirmed to CNN Business.However, the full name of the venue (Truist Park? Truist Financial Stadium?) has not yet been decided. And it's not clear when the change will take effect.Truist Financial (TFC) was formed by the $28 billion marriage of SunTrust and BB&T, a merger that closed late last week. Kelly King, the CEO of Truist, urged Braves fans not to freak out over the name change. ""It'll be fun. Baseball is baseball. There will be just as many home runs under Truist...hopefully more,"" King said during an interview.Truist has said that it could take up to two years to change the names and signage on branded assets such as SunTrust Park. The bank still needs to unveil the logo and colors for the new brand, something it expects to do by early next year. The Braves have been playing home games at SunTrust Park since the venue opened in April 2017. SunTrust, which was based in Atlanta and is a leader in the Southeast, purchased the naming rights to the stadium in 2014.Many assumed that SunTrust Park would get renamed after Truist, which is now America's sixth-largest commercial bank. But some Braves fans were holding out hope the corporate-sounding name wouldn't adorn the stadium.SunTrust and BB&T were mocked on social media in June after unveiling the Truist brand. Some compared it to the infamous and short-lived rebrand of Tribune Publishing to Tronc. In the interview, King defended the name and noted that Verizon (VZ) and Nike (NKE) were made-up words, too. ""We have no second thoughts at all. We love it,"" King said.Truist expressed confidence the name will catch on. That effort could be aided by the fact the name will emblazon the stadium of the Braves. King said Truist is working with the owners of the Braves to finalize the details of the change. "
Starbucks doesn't want you to order at its newest store,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/business/starbucks-new-pickup-location/index.html,"The coffee chain is opening ""Starbucks Pick-Up,"" a first-of-its-kind location in the United States that encourages orders from its app. The store, located near New York City's Penn Station, opens Tuesday. Plans for the store were announced in September.The new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want ""convenience,Â comfort and connection"" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. Young said the store is meant to be ""predictable and effortless"" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. The store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. The design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.Customers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. The digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. Starbucks Pick-Up will help the company ""test and learn"" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.The new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. Starbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. CEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's ""seeing encouraging early results"" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. Both Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are ""tuned to different needs at different times,"" Young said. On the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile."
Beer is slipping. Here's what Americans are drinking instead,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/business/alcohol-trends-2019-beer-sales/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Beer is in a bear market. Domestic brews, such as Budweiser, Coors Light and Miller Light, once dominated the US beverage market. But sales are declining while alternatives are spiking. Drinkers think beer is stale, compared to the innovative new brands and creative concepts emerging from other places, so they are craving a variety of other boozy drinks, including premium liquor, canned wine, spiked seltzers and pre-made bottled cocktails. In 2018, alcohol consumption in the United States dropped for the third-straight year, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. And beer is to blame: Sales of a case of beer declined 1.5%. For the past five years, beer volume in the US declined 2.4%, the firm said. The trend doesn't appear to be reversing itself. Sales of domestic beer slipped 4.6% between October 2018 and October 2019, according to Nielsen. Microbrew and craft beers are also in a minor slump, down 0.4%, despite Big Beer companies scooping them up left and right (AnheuserBusch just purchased Craft Brew Alliance, which makes Redhook Ale).But people are still drinking â€” a lot. Alternative drink categories that both firms tracked have all grown. With traditional beer getting the boot, here's what people are drinking instead.Spiked seltzerPerhaps no other alcoholic drinks had more of a breakout year than White Claw because people are seeking drinks lower in sugar and calories. The spiked seltzer brand exploded over the summer and shows no signs of slowing down. Sales cracked $1.2 billion for the previous 52 weeks ending on October 5 â€” a nearly 200% jump in growth year over year.Although White Claw remains the United States' top-selling spiked seltzer brand, rival brands have also found success. Truly, which is produced Boston Beer (SAM), is also growing in popularity. Analysts at Guggenheim said in a recent report that Truly is driving ""more than 100% of the company's retail growth"" and is helping the company, which makes Sam Adams lager, beer-proof itself. In contrast, the company's flagship beer, Samuel Adams, sales fell 11% and its 60 Minute IPA fell 14% for a 12-week period ending on November 2, according to Guggenheim. The spiked seltzer fever has also caught on with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD). It has two well-established brands, Bon & Viv and the beer-and-fruit flavored Natural Light seltzer, with plans to add a third based off its Bud Light brand. Bud Light Seltzer ""falls in a spot in between our other seltzer brands,"" meaning it will be more expensive than Natural Light and cheaper than Bon & Viv. It's scheduled to launch in early 2020. Canned wineThe portability and attractive price point of canned wine has helped sparked a new trend. Nielsen reports a 73% jump in sales between October 2018 and October 2019, totaling $54 million. Seattle-based Precept Wine has helped grow the space with its line of brands, including selling its popular House Wine in a can in 2017. CEO and founder Andrew Browne told CNN Business that the idea came from its customers seeking portable wine for social events, like boating and tailgating. The company told CNN Business that its canned wines sales are doubling the industry growth average, according to data it obtained from Nielsen. It has expanded its line of canned drinks to a wine spritzer brand, called Day Drinking with country brand Little Big Town.It's mulling an expansion of flavors, including fruit flavors and sangria. Precept Wine is projecting to sell 300,000 cases of all of its canned wine brands by end of year.Growth in the sector has also attracted the attention of AB InBev. In July, the brewer bought Babe Wine, a company co-founded by popular Instagram influencer Josh ""The Fat Jewish"" Ostrovsky and brothers David Oliver Cohen and Tanner Cohen. They are the writers behind the Babe Walker @whitegrlproblem Twitter account.Babe sells its pinot grigio, rosÃ© and red wines in cans. Terms of the purchase were not disclosed but a source close to the deal previously told CNN Business that it is AB InBev's biggest investment in wine to date.Pre-made cocktailsPopular overseas, the pre-made cocktail trend is finally hitting the states. A mix of established alcohol companies and startups are looking to enter the growing space. Sales of prepared cocktails, which includes drinks in glass, canned and plastic bottles, jumped 17% to $323 million between October 2018 and October 2019, according to Nielsen.Haus, a startup that aims to be the ""Warby Parker of alcohol,"" is one stylish direct-to-consumer brand that entered the sector this year. Haus cofounder and co-CEO Helena Price Hambrecht told CNN Business that their bottled cocktail company was created for what a new generation of drinkers want â€” a drink with natural ingredients and lower alcohol content.  ""They're perfect as a cocktail base or on their own, and they're designed for the generation that loves the social ritual of gathering, but wants a little less booze,"" she said of the brand's drinks that have a third of alcohol content of hard liquor. Haus sells two drinks: Citrus Flower and Bitter Clove, each costing $35 per bottle. The company declined to disclose specific sales numbers, but said it has received ""several thousand"" orders since launching in June. Premium liquorSpirits from whiskey to tequila grew for the ninth straight year in 2018, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a national trade organization that represents distilled spirits makers in the US. The trend is still growing this year, according to Nielsen. Spirits sales grew 6% to $15 billion from October 2018 to October 2019, according to Nielsen. Tequila grew the most at 13%, whiskey was in second at nearly 8% and vodka jumped 3%.Jack Daniels-maker Brown-Forman (BFA) continued to have a strong year. In its most recent earnings report, its portfolio of super-premium American whiskeys, including Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack and its tequila brands, led by Herradura, all had double digit percentage increases. CFO Jane Morreau said in its earnings call that the company expects to deliver another year of ""solid results."" --CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner and Paul R.

McDonald's is testing out a fried chicken sandwich,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/02/business/mcdonalds-fried-chicken-sandwich/index.html,"New York  (CNN Business)McDonald's is finally entering the fried chicken sandwich wars.  The chain is testing out a crispy chicken sandwich, made with a fried chicken filet topped with butter and crinkle-cut pickles on a potato roll. McDonald's is also testing a deluxe version, which has tomatoes, lettuce and mayo, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Houston, Texas. The tests are taking place now through January 26. McDonald's already serves the McChicken and has tested out a number of different chicken sandwiches, but its offerings have failed to inspire the type of excitement surrounding other popular fried chicken sandwiches. The new version could be a way to bring in more customers, better compete with rivals like Popeyes and Chick-fil-A, and placate its franchise operators, which have been lobbying hard for the menu item.  Fried chicken sandwiches have been a bright spot for fast food chains, boosting sales as visits to restaurants stagnate. Popeyes capitalized on the taste for chicken sandwiches with its fried chicken sandwich, which sold out within about two weeks of its launch this summer. The chain brought the sandwich back this fall, and it has once again inspired long lines and social media buzz.Meanwhile, Chick-fil-A has been growing steadily. The chain added about 1,000 locations and nearly tripled its sales over the last decade. Ranked by annual revenue, Chick-fil-A is the fifth largest US restaurant chain after McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Subway and Taco Bell â€” all of which have far more restaurants. That growth has threatened to eat into McDonald's profits, franchise operators have argued. ""A favorite, that our customers want, is a chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, they have to go to Chick-fil-A for it,"" the board of the National Owners Association, a group of McDonald's franchisees that formed in 2018, wrote in a July letter. ""Chick-fil-A's results demonstrate the power of chicken. Yes, we have great Chicken McNuggets and our McChicken is a very good product. But we do not compete in the premium chicken sandwich category, either grilled or crispy,"" the letter continued. Following the franchise operators' plea and the success of Popeyes' sandwich, McDonald's teased a new addition to the menu. In October, McDonald's told CNN Business that ""we are inspired by the customer demand for premium chicken sandwiches, and are working closely with our franchisees to deliver what our customers want. Stay tuned.""The new sandwiches are only being tested in Houston and Knoxville for now, but it seems that they may be sold nationwide next year.A spokesperson told CNN Business Monday that while the cities ""are getting a sneak peek, everyone else should stay tuned for what's to come in 2020."""
OPEC's plan to boost oil prices may not work,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/opec-iea-oil-market/index.html,"Deeper production cuts by the cartel and other major producers including Russia won't be enough to prevent a global supply glut, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.Even if the countries adhere to the deal struck in Vienna and supply growth from other nations drops, there could still be a surplus of 700,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of next year, the agency said.The Paris-based International Energy Agency kept its global oil demand growth forecasts unchanged for 2019 and 2020, at 1 million and 1.2 million barrels per day respectively.""The market has done its own sums and the reaction to oil's new deal has so far been muted,"" the agency said in its monthly report for December.The forecast does not bode well for Saudi Arabia's state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, which finalized its blockbuster IPO last week and will rely on the oil price to support its stock. Saudi Aramco briefly became the world's first $2 trillion company on Thursday, as its shares gained 10% for a second consecutive day in Riyadh. Sustaining production cutsSaudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer by far, has been doing much of the heavy lifting to curtail supply since the group began limiting production in 2017. But prices have languished around $60 a barrel, prompting the producer group to act again. Last week, OPEC and its allies agreed to cut oil production by an additional 500,000 barrels per day from January 1, bringing total output reductions to 1.7 million barrels daily. UBS analysts expect the deal to be extended beyond its current expiration date in March. Rolling it over to the rest of 2020 could address the supply surplus, but continued uncertainty over factors including surging US shale production are likely to keep Brent prices below $70 dollars per barrel, UBS said.Production cuts that are too deep or too long risk reigniting non-OPEC investment, especially from the United States, perpetuating market instability, UBS said. US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade, driven by the boom in shale production.The United States was a net oil exporter for the first time in decades in September, the International Energy Agency said. That could become commonplace starting late next year or in early 2021, it added. "
Gold cards for everyone: How a bank for the forgotten made its investors very rich,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/29/business/capitec-south-africa-bank/index.html,"London (CNN Business)How do you get a stock to increase 144,000% in less than two decades? For one South African bank, the answer is a relentless focus on customers others forgot.Capitec Bank was founded in 2001 by entrepreneurs who loaned money to low-income South Africans ignored by bigger banks. It extended credit to people who didn't have collateral, such as a home, to secure a loan. While critics say Capitec (CKHGY) helped fuel a rise in risky loans, its business has thrived. It took less than two decades for the lender to overtake overly confident rivals and amass more customers than any other bank in South Africa.""It's an amazing story of how some retailers and farmers managed to break into South Africa's banking oligopoly, where very few had succeeded historically,"" said Stuart Theobald, chairman of the financial services research firm Intellidex. Simplifying bankingCapitec's founders cut their teeth selling wine and spirits, working for companies that would later merge to become Distell (DSTZF), Africa's biggest alcoholic drinks maker. Believing the four big South African banks made things unnecessarily complicated and expensive for clients, they decided to found a lender with branches that felt more like grocery stores.""When you're in liquor [sales] you spend time in townships and shebeens [beer taverns], understanding South Africa in totality. That gave us a better understanding of the client,"" Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie told CNN Business.Capitec started by removing the fiberglass security screens that typically separated bank tellers from customers, allowing for better service. It also cut loads of red tape to make it easier to apply for a loan. While rivals would stop serving customers at 3 p.m. to focus on completing paperwork, Capitec deployed technology that improved efficiency and allowed its branches to stay open into the evening.  ""What the other banks did wrong is they didn't see [Capitec] as a real intrusion on their space,"" said Kokkie Kooyman, a portfolio manager at South African asset manager Denker Capital.Capitec might have started out making small loans to people who didn't have access to other money, but its plan was always to take on market leaders such as FirstRand and Standard Bank (SGBLY), said Kooyman.When the company debuted its bank account product, it took a novel approach. Instead of creating premium accounts for some customers, it gave everyone the same account with the same gold card â€” a gamble in a country where bank cards are status symbols.Capitec still offers just one account, even as wealthier people flock to the lender to save money on bank charges.The bank said in September that it now has 12.6 million customers â€” about 30% of the population older than 15 â€” and that it's been adding 200,000 new clients per month. Some 5.6 million of its customers have checking accounts, as opposed to savings or credit products. An obsession with customer service means that new branch workers spend 10 days training at headquarters, which culminates in a graduation ceremony and gala dinner. Fourie personally welcomes each employee to the bank. The relaxed culture is also evident in the design of Capitec's headquarters, which eschews the statement conference rooms or art collections common at rival banks.A ruthless focus on keeping costs low has paid off. Capitec has delivered much faster profit growth than its competitors, with earnings increasing by double-digit percentages for each of the past 15 years.A conservative approach to provisioning for bad debts helped Capitec weather a crisis among small banks around the time of its launch, as well as the 2014 collapse of its largest rival, African Bank. (That bank has since relaunched under new ownership.) Capitec remains obsessed with risk, analyzing its credit performances ""in the smallest detail"" and tweaking its credit policies monthly, said Fourie.Investors win bigFor Capitec's shareholders, the payoff has been huge. When the bank went public in February 2002, its shares were worth little more than 1 rand (7 US cents). The stock is now trading at 1,440 rand ($98), an increase of more than 144,000%. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index is up 424% over the same period.Capitec is ""the perfect business school case study on how to grow a bank,"" said Theobald, referring to its shift from an operation dependent on shareholder funds and the money it makes off loans to one that now derives 80% of funding from customer deposits and nearly half its income from transaction fees. The profile of its loans has also changed to cater to its increasingly middle class customer base: the bank now grants unsecured loans of up to 250,000 rand ($16,900) with payback periods of up to seven years.South Africa's debt problemFew would dispute that Capitec has made financial services more accessible. But critics argue the bank bears some responsibility for an explosion in risky lending that has left some customers drowning in debt.Capitec built its business on unsecured lending â€” or loans that do not use property or other assets as collateral and typically come with higher interest rates. Forty percent of the 7.8 million South Africans with an unsecured loan are in default, according to asset manager Differential Capital. Those in default spend a third of their income on average to service the loans.While Capitec ""pushed the envelope"" in terms of offering larger loans, all the big banks ""contributed enthusiastically"" to South Africa's unsecured lending boom, said Gabriel Davel, CEO of the Centre for Credit Market Development and the previous head of South Africa's National Credit Regulator.Capitec is now South Africa's second biggest unsecured lender after Standard Bank (SGBLY).Capitec's new competitorsAs it moves away from unsecured lending towards traditional banking, Capitec hopes to steal an increasing share of the market from wary rivals in new areas such as small business lending.But it is no longer the new kid on the block and will also have to fend off competition from several tech banking startups, which, thanks to Capitec, now know what is possible."
How cities are using technology to solve their trash problems,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/27/business/technology-and-trash-intl/index.html,"As urban populations continue to grow, some cities are struggling to cope. Many are turning to new technologies for cost-effective solutions to clean up waste.The global waste management market is booming as a result, expected to reach $530 billion by 2025 from $331 billion in 2017, according to a report by Allied Market Research.Cities that address waste problems immediately have the best chance to avoid severe long-term consequences, says Ricardo Cepeda-MÃ¡rquez, solid waste director for C40 Cities, a global network of cities committed to tackling climate change.Waste that goes uncollected can lead to blocked drains, flooding and the spread of waterborne diseases. Organic matter dumped in landfills â€” where it lacks the air to decompose quickly â€” generates methane gas, accelerating climate change.Generating energy from wasteCopenhagen, Denmark, recently opened its innovative waste-to-energy power plant, known as Copenhill or Amager Bakke, which is topped with an artificial ski slope. The plant, which burns waste instead of fossil fuels, is capable of converting 450,000 tons of trash into energy annually, delivering electricity to 30,000 households and heating to 72,000. Though it still produces CO2 emissions from burning, the city plans to install a system to capture the carbon released by the incineration process, and then store the carbon or find a commercial use for it. By tapping an otherwise unused resource, it will also help the city move away from its dependence on fossil fuels. ""Instead of placing waste outside in a big landfill, we use the waste to produce energy for heating and electricity in the most efficient way currently available,"" the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen Frank Jensen told CNN Business in an email. ""Efficient waste incineration supplies district heating for 99% of the buildings in Copenhagen, so we will eliminate the pollution from coal, oil and petroleum,"" he adds, helping the capital meet its goal to become the world's first carbon-neutral city by 2025. Cities such as Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Shenzhen in China, and Hanoi in Vietnam are experimenting with similar waste-to-energy plants.But Cepeda-MÃ¡rquez warns that this technology has its limits. A city needs solid infrastructure and a strong waste collection system already in place before it can reap the benefits of one of these plants.  ""Many global south cities, with badly managed waste management systems, expect that with the ideal incinerator or waste-to-energy facility all of their problems will go away,"" he says. ""But if you have a broken system, there is no technology that is going to fix it."" Smarter systems Other cities are starting on a street level, using artificial intelligence and automation to sort recyclables, or sensors to reduce the amount thrown away. For instance, Singapore and Seoul, South Korea, have installed smart, solar-powered trash cans on their streets. Each is equipped with a compactor, enabling it to hold more trash. Once the bin is full, its sensors alert the waste collectors. By 2050, 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas, according to the UN, putting a strain on existing city infrastructure. Typically, cities send out different trucks to collect different types of waste - one truck collecting plastic for recycling, another collecting food waste, for example. But that requires a lot of trucks, which means added costs and more traffic.""In many cities in Europe, the streets are very narrow, and there isn't a lot of open space for multiple waste collection trucks to be doing the rounds,"" says Cepeda-MÃ¡rquez.Norway's capital Oslo has designed a clever model to avoid this. Since 2012, city residents have been required to use different colored bags for different types of waste, and instead of collecting them separately, trucks gather all the bags at once and take them to an optical sorting plant. The green bags containing food waste and blue bags with plastic waste are separated from other residual waste by sophisticated optical reading technology, which detects the color of the bags with approximately 98% precision. The city claims that increased waste segregation and public awareness campaigns have had a positive effect, reducing the amount thrown away by each household and increasing the amount that is reused and recycled. In 2018, 37% of household waste was recycled, up from 10% in 2004. "
"Virgin Galactic's stock could soar 726%, Morgan Stanley says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/business/virgin-galactic-stock/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Virgin Galactic's stock is soaring after an analyst said its space planes could one day disrupt the air travel industry, potentially raking in nearly a trillion dollars a year in sales.The spaceflight's company stock surged 12% Monday after Morgan Stanley released a report predicting Virgin Galactic's (SPCE) shares could rise as high as $60 over the coming years if the company successfully executes its business goals. The stock was sitting just below $8 before the report was released.Galactic wants to transition from a space tourism company (it has still yet to fly any civilians into space, but it plans to soon) into a travel company. It intends to accomplish that by building space planes that send passengers on ultra-fast flights around the world. ""A viable space tourism business is what you pay for today,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. ""But a chance to disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline [total addressable market] is what is really likely to drive the upside.""Galactic's stock had persistently fallen since it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 28. Morgan Stanley set a near-term price target of $22 a share, which represents a 167% increase from Galactic's current level of $8.24. The firm believes the majority of Galactic's upside will come from its hypersonic point-to-point air travel rather than its space tourism business. ""The shares feature biotech-type risk/reward where today's space tourism business serves as a funding strategy and innovation catalyst to incubate enabling tech for the hypersonic point-to-point air travel opportunity,"" Jonas said.Morgan Stanley isn't alone in its bullish outlook for Galactic. Sam Korus, an industrial innovation analyst at ARK Invest, said last month he was excited about Galactic's potential line of business. His research indicates as many as 2.7 million people might be willing to pay up to $100,000 for a long-distance hypersonic flight that shaves hours off the normal travel time.The company has long talked about conducting long-distance flights, and Boeing (BA) in October invested $20 million in the company in a deal focused largely on aiding development of hypersonic transit.Galactic, which is the world's first publicly traded space-tourism company, reported in its inaugural earnings last month that it lost $138 million in the first nine months of 2019. By far its largest expense â€” nearly $100 million â€” went to research and development."
Starbucks is adding a new holiday-themed iced drink to its menu,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/business/starbucks-new-holiday-iced-drink/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Starbucks is adding a new iced drink to its holiday menu as sales continue to grow for chilly concoctions â€” even in winter.The new drink is Irish Cream Cold Brew, which is the chain's cold brew coffee mixed with Irish Cream syrup and topped with vanilla sweet cream cold foam and cocoa powder. It goes on sale Tuesday across Starbucks' US stores and will be available for a limited time. The price for a grande will range from $4.45 to $4.75, depending on the Starbucks' location.Customers can customize the cold foam with alternative milks, including almond, coconut or soy. The Irish Cream syrup is also available as a topping in any of its other beverages for an additional charge.Irish Cream Cold Brew is Starbucks' second holiday-themed iced drink to join its menu in the past three years. In 2016, it offered a limited-time drink called the Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew. But the addition of this year's beverage comes after Starbucks added a Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew drink for the first time, which the company said sold well. Cold drinks are growing in popularity for Starbucks. They made up more than half of the company's sales last year â€” a 13% increase from 2013, it said. Starbucks (SBUX) credited cold drinks, like cold brew coffees, for bolstering its bottom line and helping to kickstart sales in the afternoon, which previously has been a sore spot for the company. Starbucks is also having success attracting young people with its cold coffee drinks because customers view cold coffee as an alternative to soda and energy drinks, according to a recent report from Guggenheim Partners. And Starbucks customers are more loyal to cold brews and iced coffees. ""These categories are more habitual and create more brand affinity,"" Roz Brewer, chief operating officer for Starbucks, said in 2018 when it announced the expansion of its the nitrogen-infused cold brew coffee across the United States. In its most recent earnings report, Starbucks' US comparable sales growth jumped 6%, with 5% of that from beverages. A company spokesperson told CNN Business that the growth was led by its cold beverages, including the newly introduced Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew. The drink, which costs more than a typical iced coffee, also helped Starbucks grow its average receipt price to 3% for the quarter.Starbucks' Irish Cream Cold Brew drink joins the chain's usual array of hot drinks that can also be made cold, including peppermint mocha and eggnog latte.Rival Dunkin' (DNKN) also has its own menu of iced holiday drinks. In November, the chain began selling two seasonal flavor swirls (gingerbread s'mores and winter white chocolate) that can be added to its iced drinks. McDonald's  (MCD)also added a cinnamon cookie latte that can be made hot or iced. That was the chain's first seasonal drink since 2014, when it started selling the white chocolate mocha latte."

In a release, the company said that it's using ""high-quality, traceable CBD"" for a new array of items including smoothies, chocolate-dipped fruit and baked goods. CBD has become a mainstream phenomenon since the passage of the US Farm Bill last year. which legalized hemp with some conditions. People praise hemp's health benefits, which include helping insomnia or helping inflammation, but there's little clinical research that proves CBD's effectiveness. The Food & Drug Administration still hasn't decided how to regulate CBD products.But that hasn't stopped people from buying it.

America's milk industry is struggling. Don't blame oat milk,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/milk-industry-dean-foods/index.html,"New York  (CNN Business)Milk is falling out of fashion. In 2010, 55 billion pounds of milk were sold in the United States. By 2018, that figure dropped to 47.7 billion, a decline of about 13%. Last week, that shift finally overwhelmed Dean Foods, the country's biggest dairy processor. In a statement announcing the company's bankruptcy filing, CEO Eric Beringause pointed to ""continuing declines in consumer milk consumption."" Meanwhile, a new, competing sector is on the rise: plant-based milks, where US sales have grown 14% in the past two years, according to a July report from the Plant Based Foods Association, a trade group, and the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses. From April 2018 to April of 2019, sales of oat milk jumped 222%, according to GFI. The beverage is certainly buzzy: High-end coffee shops now sell pricey almond-, oat- and coconut-milk lattes. In 2018, Gothamist ran a story titled ""Don't Panic: Reports of 'Oat Milk Shortage' are greatly exaggerated"" after a New Yorker piece raised the alarm. But the plant-based sector is still small, and can't explain such a big drop in milk sales. Other factors are making an impact. Health-conscious consumers, increasingly seeking low-calorie drinks with a nutritional boost or jolt of caffeine, may be swapping dairy milk out for sports drinks, tea, coffee or bottled water, a growing category. Stagnating breakfast cereal sales are also contributing to the problem. But per-capita consumption of butter and cheese is growing, suggesting that the plant-based trend hasn't affected dairy overall. Evolving tastes are just part of the story. There was ""a perfect storm,"" said Sarah Lloyd, director of special projects for the Wisconsin Farmers Union and a family dairy farmer herself. As milk sales fell, companies like Dean struggled to find retail customers. Dairy farmers got squeezed by changes in the international milk market and domestic oversupply.Dean was victim to these changes â€” as well as its own miscalculations, such as its failure to innovate with new products. Although the bankruptcy filing was no surprise to those who saw the challenges facing milk, Dean's collapse could be a signal of even tougher times ahead for the industry. ""It's alarming,"" Lloyd said.Marin Bozic, assistant professor in University of Minnesota's applied economics department, said that Dean's bankruptcy is more than just symbolic. ""This is a major inflection point for the dairy sector of the United States,"" he said. The fall of Dean FoodsThe milk industry has been consolidating for years. In 2001, Suiza Foods, then a major milk processor and distributor, merged with Dean Foods and took its name. The combination made the new Dean Foods a $10 billion company with a national footprint. The move followed years of spectacular growth by Suiza, driven by a series of frenzied acquisitions. In a 2001 story about the merger, the Wall Street Journal called Suiza ""the leading consolidator of the fragmented dairy industry,"" noting that the company had made more than 40 acquisitions since it entered the dairy space in the early 1990s.""I've never seen anything like that,"" Brian Gould, emeritus professor of agriculture and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison told CNN Business. He said Suiza's growth ""wasn't organic,"" adding, ""it was really just from the outside in."" After its merger, Dean went on an another acquisition spree, buying up a broad array of brands including WhiteWave, which made Silk milk alternatives, and others. Then, in 2012, Dean changed course â€” doubling down on its dairy portfolio, spinning off WhiteWave and all of the plant-based milks under the Silk brand. The idea was to focus on milk to improve its growth. Today, Dean's product line is almost entirely dairy-based. In addition to milk, it sells sour cream, cottage cheese and ice cream. Although rivals developed lactose-free or protein-rich milks, Dean didn't make significant changes. Consolidation on the milk processing side was mirrored in grocery and retail. The food industry saw more than 500 mergers and acquisitions in 2016, the highest rate in 15 years, according to the USDA. For Dean, that meant there were fewer customers for its products, and heavier reliance on each one. The combination, coupled with declining milk sales, put Dean in a tough spot. Then in 2018 Walmart, one of its major clients, opened its own milk processing plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, delivering a fatal blow. Dean said it missed out on the sale of 55 million gallons of milk in the second half of 2018 because of Walmart's decision. It was forced to terminate contracts with dairy farmers who were facing their own crisis. Milk prices drop Last year, the Dairy Farmers of America â€” the country's largest dairy cooperative â€” reported annual net sales of $13.6 billion, a $1.1 billion decrease from 2017. DFA pointed to lower average US milk prices. The dip can be attributed in part to changes the global milk industry. In 2015, the European Union put an end to milk quotas. Around the same time, Chinese demand for milk weakened and Russia banned imports. The changes led to a glut in the global milk supply, driving down prices worldwide and putting pressure on the United States, which had a healthy export market. Farmers are accustomed to the ebb and flow in dairy prices, and while those years of low prices marked a particularly tough cycle, relief started to come in 2018, noted Alan Bjerga, senior vice president of communications at the National Milk Producers Federation, a lobbying group. Then retaliatory tariffs from Mexico and China kicked in, delivering another blow to the industry. In a June statement about trade relations with China, the NMPF said that ""tariffs erected in 2018 have proven to be a catastrophic blow for the US dairy industry.""""It would have been a long low-price cycle in any case, but it would have been on the long side,"" Bjerga told CNN Business. ""The trade war definitely prolonged it. And that definitely was a problem for farmers who really weren't able to hold out anymore."" Oversupply and a new normalAs milk sales falter and dairy farmers exit the industry, something counterintuitive has been happening: Dairy production is growing. Milk production grew 15% from 2009 to 2018, according to the USDA.  That rise in production can be partially explained by a growing overall demand for dairy products. Still, the domestic milk supply is outstripping demand. ""The underlying cause of this long low-price period is overproduction, plain and simple,"" said Lloyd. ""There haven't been ways to discipline the production, so it's just continued up and up and up and up."" Lloyd said that farmers, desperate to make ends meet, are boosting production to generate cash, a situation she describes as ""no breaks agriculture."" For some farmers, the difficulties have just become too much. They shared their distress with Bozic, the University of Minnesota professor. ""The phrase that comes up again and again [is] that this time, it feels different,"" he said, like ""we are entering a new era.""And as the pressure on farmers continue, the stakes are high. We ""are fighting for our lives,"" Lloyd said."
McDonald's starts testing a Beyond Meat burger,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/business/beyond-meat-mcdonalds-test/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)McDonald's will begin testing a Beyond Meat burger, giving the plant-based meat craze a major endorsement.The P.L.T. (plant, lettuce, tomato) burger will go on sale in 28 McDonald's locations in Southwestern Ontario, including Canada's largest city, Toronto, for a limited time. The 12-week test will begin Monday.Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock shot up 11.5% on Thursday. Some food industry insiders had speculated that McDonald's could partner with Nestle to bring a vegan burger to market in North America. Nestle made McDonald's vegan burger, the Big Vegan TS, in Germany, one of McDonald's top 5 international markets.McDonald's (MCD) said it is testing the P.L.T. because of customers' growing interest in plant-based alternatives. The company said it's still in ""learning mode,"" so it will review the test's results before adding the Beyond Meat burger elsewhere. The plant-based protein trend is growing rapidly as people try to eat less meat and to reduce their environmental footprints. Unlike veggie burgers, which long had a mediocre reputation, the new plant-based proteins are designed to look and taste like meat and appeal to meat eaters as well as vegans and vegetarians.McDonald's has been slower than its competitors in embracing the meatless trend. Burger King sells Impossible Whoppers to all of its US locations and Tim Horton's sells variations of Beyond Meat-based sandwiches in select Canadian markets. White Castle, Qdoba, Bareburger and others, are selling plant-based menu items as well.So far, McDonald's plant-based burger sales have been limited. Two years ago, the company announced it would sell a McVegan burger, made with a soy patty, in Finland and Sweden. McDonald's partnered with a specialty Norwegian food company called Orkla on that earlier product. The chain also offers veggie burgers on some menus, depending on local demand.For McDonald's, the decision isn't as easy because it has struggled with a complex menu that has angered franchises and slowed down service. CEO Steve Easterbrook previously said that the company has to weigh whether adding plant-based menu options is ""worth it.""  The P.L.T. will be served on a toasted bun with the usual array of toppings, including lettuce, onions and tomatoes. McDonald's will charge $6.49 Canadian ($5 US). Cheese is also optional. Beyond Meat's stock surged nearly 600% after it went public in June, but it has faded in recent weeks over fears it was overvalued. Still, shares are up more than 400% since its opening price of $25 per share.-- CNN Business' Danielle Weiner-Bronner contributed to this report."

"Boeing to fix engines on 7,000 jets",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/boeing-737-ng-fix-southwest-airlines-fatality/index.html,"A single passenger was killed on the plane when a fan blade broke and caused part of the engine covering to hit the side of the jet. That broke one of the windows, and the cabin rapidly depressurized. The crew was able to land the plane, but the woman sitting next to that window was killed. The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the accident, recommended Tuesday that Boeing redesign part of the outer covering of the planes' jet engines to prevent it from flying into the plane should a fan blade break free on a future flight. It said that all Boeing 737 Next Generation series airplanes should be retrofitted with whatever fix Boeing comes up with. Boeing has delivered about 6,700 of the 737 NG jets to airlines around the world, but it has stopped taking new orders for them as it shifted to the 737 Max. It has fewer  than 100 of the NG planes yet to build and and deliver. Boeing 737 NG planes have not been affected by the grounding of the 737 Max in the wake of two fatal crashes. But the 737 NG had other safety issues, including the discovery of cracks on some of the older planes on a part used to keep the wings in place. Those cracks have grounded a handful of the 737 NGs.The final decision on any fix is up to the Federal Aviation Administration, not the NTSB, whose role is to investigate the causes of accidents. But Boeing (BA) said it is already working on enhancements of the engines' design to addresss the NTSB's recommendations. And it said until that fix is in place inspections of the fans blades will allow the planes to operate safely.""Our common goal is to help prevent similar events from happening in the future,"" it said.The NTSB blamed neither Boeing (BA) nor Southwest (LUV), saying that the crack in the fan blade was not detectable and that the risk of the engine casing breaking free was unknown before this incident. But shares of Boeing fell as much as 2% immediately after the report was released, although it later recovered much of that loss.-- CNN's Rene Marsh contributed to this report"
The artificial skin that allows robots to feel,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/28/business/robot-artificial-skin-scn/index.html,"Scientists last month unveiled an artificial skin that enables robots to feel and respond to physical contact, a skill that will be needed as they come in increasingly close contact with people.In 2017, manufacturers worldwide used roughly 85 industrial robots per 10,000 employees, according to a report by the International Federation of Robotics. The same report predicts the global supply of industrial robots to grow 14% per year until 2021. But if robots end up working more closely with their fleshy colleagues, one concern is how they will interact safely.""Currently, robots do not have any sense of touch,"" Professor Gordon Cheng, who developed the special skin with his team at the Technical University of Munich, tells CNN Business. Robots are able to exert forces that could seriously injure a human being, so employers need to ensure they are aware of their surroundings and able to navigate around people.  ""Touch enables safe robot operation, by detecting contact with unseen obstacles and giving the possibility to apply the correct force for achieving a task, without damaging objects, people and the robot itself,"" Chiara Bartolozzi, a robotics expert at the Italian Institute of Technology, independent of the research, tells CNN Business. Not only could this special skin make collaboration between humans and robots safer, it could also enable the future of robots as caregivers, health workers and companions. Mimicking human skinTo develop the synthetic skin, the researchers began by studying humans.Each person has about 5 million skin receptors that register what's happening on the body's surface and send signals to the brain. But the brain can't digest information from each one at the same time. Instead, the nervous system prioritizes new sensations. Mimicking this, the team covered a human-size autonomous robot (known as H-1) with more than 13,000 sensors from shoulder to toe, that are able to detect temperature, acceleration, proximity and pressure.""These [factors] are fundamental to sense in humans... [they] are what make interactions between human and human very safe,"" says Cheng.The team is currently working on creating smaller sensor cells that could be produced in bulk.Some scientists are skeptical of its scalability. The high cost of each sensor and its fragility is a major barrier for mass production, Etienne Burdet, a professor of human robotics at Imperial College London, tells CNN Business.For years, scientists have been scrambling to develop technology that enables tactile sensation â€” both for robots and humans. Last week, a team at Northwestern University unveiled a wireless and battery-free smart skin that could add touch to virtual experiences, such as a Skype call. Cheng has already overcome one challenge that has hindered previous attempts at creating a robotic sense of touch. Most have relied on vast computing power to process signals from all the artificial skin cells, while his creation only sends signals when individual cells are activated. This means the system is not overloaded with data, and, in that way, it acts just like the human nervous system. For instance, we feel gloves when we first put them on, but eventually our bodies learn to ignore them.Future colleagues or carersThese traits could enable robots to perceive their surroundings with more sensitivity, and give them the ability to interact with humans and anticipate and avoid accidents. ""Technology like this could open opportunities where robots could work much more closely with humans, such as caregiving professions,"" Bob Doyle, vice president of the Robotic Industries Association, tells CNN Business. ""They could help someone get out of bed, or help them around the house,"" he adds. However, Doyle acknowledges that these technologies are still a long way from actual application in the field, and that ensuring the safety of humans will come first. "
Starbucks opens its biggest store ever,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/business/worlds-largest-starbucks-chicago/index.html,"The coffee chain opened its world's largest Roastery location on Friday. The five-story location is 35,000 square feet, overtaking the Tokyo Roastery as Starbucks' biggest location. Located in the city's Magnificent Mile neighborhood, the new Roastery is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location. It was first announced in 2017.Starbucks (SBUX) said the Chicago Roastery is a tribute to the city and region, where it has nearly 800 Starbucks stores and employs more than 18,000 people. The Roastery itself has 200 employees. Roasteries are intended to be tourist attractions. They feature specialty coffees and teas, on-premise roasters and massive coffee casks where freshly roasted beans are held. They also have bars with craft cocktails and serve fancier food than a normal Starbucks location.The Chicago location has all of that and a unique design that emphasizes the building's natural light from the massive windows. Centrally located in the store is a 56-foot steel cask that stores coffee beans. Surrounding it is the region's first-ever curved escalator that gives customers a 360-degree view of the store. Selling coffee is a central part of the store. There are three coffee bars that offer a variety of brewing methods, including an ""Experiential"" coffee car that ""provides customers the opportunity to immerse in the art, science, and theatre of coffee,"" according to a press release. A mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are served at its Arriviamo Bar, along with Chicago-specific cocktails. And this Roastery is the only location in the United States to sell liquid nitrogen gelato, a sweet dessert designed to be eaten with coffee. It's also served in the Milan Roastery.Princi, which is Starbucks' bakery and cafe concept, is also featured prominently. It offers a full menu of baked goods and heartier items, like pizza. This is Starbucks' sixth Roastery location. The company uses the spaces test out design concepts and menu items â€” and to double down on its promise of offering a ""third place"" between home and work, even as it focuses on speed and convenience elsewhere.Starbucks has always been ""a more affluent brand,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy previously told CNN Business. The Roasteries take it ""even more upstream,"" he said.Roastery joins Starbucks' growing line of store concepts. Earlier this month, it opened ""Starbucks Pick-Up,"" a first-of-its-kind location in New York that encourages orders from its app. The location is a fraction the size of its normal cafe.The Chicago Roastery will be open seven days a week.

FAA chief: Boeing 737 Max won't be back in the air in 2019,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/business/faa-boeing-737-max/index.html,"Administrator Stephen Dickson, appearing on CNBC ahead of his testimony before the House Transportation Committee on Wednesday, said he could not provide a time frame for when the plane will get approval to fly again. But he said there are 10 or 11 different steps in the certification process that are yet to be completed.  ""If you do the math, it's going to extend into 2020,"" he said. When asked if that meant it might be approved in January or February, he declined to give a target.""If I had that kind of a crystal ball I would certainly be able to share it,"" he said. ""But it's very important that our team works very closely with the international authorities that have been working with us and with the Boeing team to do this right.""In his prepared opening remarks for his testimony later Wednesday, Dickson also declined to give any time target for when the plane will be allowed to fly again.""I have directed FAA employees to take whatever time is needed to do that work,"" he said of the certification process.The planes were grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.The grounding has cost Boeing billions of dollars. Boeing (BA) has continued to insist that it wanted to get the plane approved to fly again, at least in the United States, by the end of this year and that commercial service could begin as soon as January, although the decision rests with the FAA.  Asked for a comment on Dickson's statement that the plane will not be approved to fly again this year, Boeing would only say that ""we continue to work closely with the FAA and global regulators towards certification and the safe return to service of the Max.""The three US airlines that own the planes, Southwest (LUV), American (AAL) and United (UAL), have said they are not planning to include the plane on flight schedules until at least March. Dickson said he's not concerned that Boeing has continued to insist it was shooting for the end of the year for service, even though he has told Boeing that it wouldn't happen.""I made it very clear that Boeing's plan is not the FAA's plan. We're certainly working closely together,"" he said. Asked if he was under pressure from Boeing to speed up the certification process he responded, ""I would not say there have been any requests to cut corners.""The hearing Wednesday will include a testimony from Edward Pierson, a Boeing retiree and whistleblower who told NBC earlier this week that he had warned of potential problems with the 737 Max and had those concerns dismissed by Boeing officials due to costs. The hearing also comes on the day that the Wall Street Journal reported that an FAA analysis of the 737 Max after the first fatal crash of the jet in Indonesia found that it could average a fatal crash every two or three years without changes. A person familiar with the document confirmed to CNN that the details as reported by the Journal are accurate.But the FAA did not ground the plane after the first crash. And before changes could be made, there was a second fatal crash in Ethiopia five months after the first. The grounding of the jet occurred after the second crash. The Journal said that FAA analysis is due to be made public at Wednesday's hearing.-- CNN's Rene Marsh contributed to this report"
A cold and wet potato harvest season may lead to a US French fry shortage,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/business/potato-harvest-french-fry-shortage-trnd/index.html," (CNN)Winter is coming â€” for our French fries.Unusually cold and wet weather during the potato harvest season has left some growers in the US and Canada unable to harvest a significant portion of their crop.Now, processors across North America are rushing to find potatoes from additional sources to keep up with the increasing demand for fries, in news first reported by Bloomberg.The US is the fifth largest producer of potatoes in the world, and the crop is grown in nearly every state. But this year, the amount of potatoes produced and harvested is down in some of the top-producing states, including Idaho, Oregon, and North Dakota.Overall potato production in the US is forecast to fall about 6.1 percent from last year, according to a November report from the US Department of Agriculture. That's the lowest it's been since 2010. In Idaho, which produces about a third of US potatoes, production is forecast to fall five percent from last year, USDA reported. About 308,000 acres were harvested, down about 7,000 from 2018.In Canada, potato harvests in the western provinces of Manitoba and Alberta were particularly affected, according to Kevin MacIsaac, general manager for United Potato Growers of Canada. For potato growers, that could mean significant losses, MacIsaac said. It could also mean that some growers might not be able to fulfill their contracts with processing companies. Factories that supply potatoes to restaurants and grocery stores might have to rely on other sources or import them. And potatoes originally designated for other purposes, like chips or the bags of fresh potatoes you buy at the store, might instead be used to make French fries.Despite cold weather affecting some of this year's crop, Frank Muir, president and CEO of the Idaho Potato Commission, said he's not too worried. By the time the frost hit in October, Idaho farmers had harvested about 85 percent of their crop. And those potatoes were of good quality.""Even though the weather took a bit of a top off our crop, we still are harvesting probably in the neighborhood of 13 billion pounds of potatoes,"" Muir told CNN.Fast food prices aren't likely to changeIf all this has you devising a plan to stockpile fries or take to the streets to demand your right to crispy, golden-brown spuds, you can sit tight for now.Experts say that prices at fast food restaurants like McDonalds, Burger King and Wendy's have been fixed for the year through contracts and are unlikely to change. ""[Fast food restaurants] look at that menu board as sacrosanct,"" Stephen Nicholson, a grains and oilseeds analyst at Rabo AgriFinance, told CNN. ""They don't want to change that menu board unless they absolutely have to.""But though consumers might not see a difference on the fast food menu boards, Nicholson said prices for French fries could go up in other places, like local bars, casual dining chains and the produce and frozen aisles at grocery stores.Though prices might go up a little, those in the industry say they don't think people will notice a difference.""The consumer will see French fries,"" MacIsaac said. ""It's just the behind the scenes, those raw potatoes may have moved in different areas than perhaps they would in areas where there's lots of supplies."""
The biggest bank you've never heard of,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/truist-bank-merger-suntrust-bbt/index.html,"The $28 billion marriage of SunTrust and BB&T means those brands are getting slowly phased out after a combined 275 years of history. The deal between the nation's largest banking tie-up since 2004 was presented as a merger of equals, forcing the banks to start with a blank slate.""The whole essence of Truist is about two great, iconic, old companies coming together to form a new organization that is looking forward,"" Truist CEO Kelly King told CNN Business.Truist, which officially started trading as a new company on Monday after getting regulatory approval, hired a national branding company to come up with a name. ""We gave them a clean sheet of paper and said we want a name that doesn't carry baggage,"" said King, who previously served as CEO of BB&T.Yet the new corporate-sounding name has been mocked on social media. It was even been compared with Tribune Publishing's infamous, and short-lived, rebrand to Tronc. An unofficial Twitter poll by American Banker found that more than two-thirds of users ""hate"" the Truist name. King predicted the new brand will eventually catch on and reminded critics that Verizon (VZ) and Nike (NKE) were made-up words too.""We have no second thoughts at all. We love it,"" he said. Truist even compromised on the location of its headquarters. The new bank will be based in Charlotte, but it will maintain a strong presence in Atlanta, where SunTrust was headquartered, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where BB&T was based. Truist promises no mass layoffsBank customers likely haven't noticed a major difference from the merger just yet. The names on local branches haven't changed, and aren't expected to for at least a year. (However, SunTrust and BB&T customers can now use any of the company's 4,500 ATMs for free.)Truist has promised Wall Street the deal will create $1.6 billion in cost savings, including by shutting down branches.King said Truist has not decided precisely how many branches will close, although he conceded that in some places BB&T and SunTrust branches are located ""side by side."" When the merger was announced, SunTrust and BB&T pledged not to lay off client-facing employees who are performing well.""It's the compassionate, right thing to do for our teammates,"" King said. ""It's not one of those things where your branch is going to close, 'Y'all are going to get fired.'""'We're still small'The Truist deal, the largest since before the 2008 financial crisis, is testing the nation's appetite for large bank deals. With more than $460 billion in assets and $330 billion in deposits, Truist is now America's No. 6 commercial lender. The SunTrust-BB&T merger received unanimous approval from the FDIC, although one official warned the deal poses ""very significant financial stability risks.""King argued these concerns are overblown, noting that Truist's balance sheet is dwarfed by that of the largest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), for instance, is sitting on $2.8 trillion of assets, roughly six times what Truist has.""We are large, but we're still small,"" King said. And unlike JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), Truist is not a big player in the kinds of exotic financial securities that fueled the 2008 crisis. ""We're not international, we're not doing a lot of unusual, complex, risky kinds of transactions,"" King said. Still, Senator Elizabeth Warren announced plans last week to introduce legislation that would force regulators to more closely scrutinize bank mergers. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate fears these deals will create Too-Big-To-Fail institutions, like the ones that required massive bailouts during the last crisis. Warren called out the Federal Reserve for the fact that it did not decline any of the 3,819 bank merger applications it received between 2006 and 2017.""Regulators serve as rubber stamps,"" Warren's Senate office said last week, calling the review process ""fundamentally broken.""King, fresh off a 10-month merger review that included public hearings, doesn't see it that way.""This was a very thorough, rigorous process, which we fully supported,"" King said. ""It was intense.""The Truist CEO also noted that banks often withdraw their merger applications after regulators signal proposed deals won't be approved. Truist CEO defends Dodd-Frank, CFPBPresident Donald Trump vowed to ""do a big number"" on the post-crisis financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. Yet King said he hasn't witnessed significant deregulation, calling the adjustments ""relatively minor."" And he suggested ripping up Dodd-Frank would be unwise.""I would be less critical today of Dodd-Frank than I might've been 10 years ago,"" King said. The Truist boss applauded several aspects of the post-crisis financial reform law, including the Federal Reserve's annual review of banks' financial resilience. He also praised the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government watchdog agency that was the brainchild of Warren. ""At its core, it is a really good agency. We needed that,"" King said.Trump has sought to defang the CFPB, including by appointing Mick Mulvaney in 2017 to temporarily lead the agency that he once pushed to abolish. The Supreme Court has agreed to take up a case that could significantly weaken the agency's structure.""Overall, as a long-term banker, I'm comfortable with the level of regulation we have,"" King said, adding that he's also not in favor of significantly more red tape. ""It's appropriate, tough, thorough and generally fair."" "
Hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen is buying the Mets,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/business/mets-sale-steve-cohen-fred-wilpon/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)The New York Mets have agreed to be sold to hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen, in a deal that will take five years to complete, the team announced Wednesday evening.During that time the current owner, Fred Wilpon, 83, will continue to serve as the team's chairman. He bought half the team along with Nelson Doubleday in 1980, and the other half in 2002. Wilpon's son, Jeff Wilpon, who is the team's chief operating officer, will remain in that job for five years.The Mets have struggled to compete against the more popular New York Yankees, and it shows in the team's financial fortunes as well as their middling success on the field. The team's fans have often focused their anger and disappointment on the Wilpons for their decisions on whether or not to sign players.Just earlier in the day Wednesday the Mets lost one of their best pitchers, Zack Wheeler, to the rival Philadelphia Phillies when he signed a five-year, $118 million deal with them. The Mets had 2018 revenue of $340 million and a valuation of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes, a leading source of information on team finances. The Yankees had revenue of $668 million and a valuation of $4.6 billion, making them by far the most valuable team in the sport according to Forbes.Cohen, 63, is CEO and President of Point72 Asset Management, and he will continue in those roles. He bought a small, minority stake in the team in 2012, as the Wilpon family struggled to recover from their losses due to investments with Bernard Madoff. Cohen will end up with majority ownership and total control of the team in five years, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Cohen is worth $13.6 billion according to Forbes' real time Billionaire Tracker. While he has had success in the world of finance, he's also had his share of problems. His previous firm, SAC Capital Advisors, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and paid a $1.8 billion fine. SAC got its name from Cohen's three initials.But Cohen, who was banned from managing money for two years after the firm's guilty plea, was able to return to managing outside money in 2018 under a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He had been facing a lifetime ban before that settlement."
What's fueling the boom in food technology?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/business/israel-food-technology/index.html,"Yet the country â€” home to more than 350 agriculture and food technology companies â€” punches above its weight. In 2018, annual investment in Israel's food tech sector rose to $100 million, according to a recent report by Start-Up Nation Central. This makes it a strong player within a booming market: BIS Research predicts the global food tech market to be worth more than $250 billion by 2022.""So much is happening in such a small place,"" says Tamar Weiss, development manager for the agri-food tech sector of Start-Up Nation Central.Weiss believes this is down to Israel's ambition to tackle the environmental and ethical challenges around agriculture. ""People are aware of it in their own personal life, this has really pushed the sector forward,"" she adds.Sustainable food In 2017, Didier Toubia set up Aleph Farms, an Israeli food company that engineers cultured beef â€” meat grown in a laboratory from cow cells. ""The objective was to bring balance back to nature, and to use the natural resources on earth in a wiser way,"" he tells CNN Business. The company has raised $14 million to date and made headlines around the world last year for developing the first slaughter-free beef steak. In October, it successfully grew meat in space for the first time. This experiment proved that cultivated meat could be a way of producing high quality protein using less resources, says Toubia. Barclays predicts the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales over the next decade, with companies like Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat leading the charge. Though not yet commercially available, the cultured meat market is also expanding, with the number of startups in the field increasing from four at the end of 2016 to more than two dozen last year, according to The Good Food Institute. Israel's thriving scene is in part thanks to its government's Innovation Authority, which provides company grants and has financed a $28 million food tech incubator. But it is also about the culture. ""In Israel, there is a lot of awareness of animal welfare ... I think it is encoded into the Jewish tradition,"" says Toubia. Weiss adds to this stating that the kosher culture ""brings in a lot of awareness around food: it being clean, or made in a specific way, or linking values with food.""Animal welfare Yehuda Elram, CEO of Jerusalem-based start-up eggXYt agrees that the Jewish religion values compassion towards animals. ""These are conscientious consumers who demand that companies abide by certain rules, among them is ending animal cruelty,"" he says. eggXYt has developed a technology that can detect the gender of chicks before hatching, in order to prevent the practice of male chick culling in poultry farming where female chicks are required for egg production.Each year, roughly seven billion male chicks are killed after hatching, according to industry estimates.Sorting males from females before the chicks hatch would avoid this, while also helping financially: factories would no longer waste space and energy incubating male eggs, and the eggs could be repurposed for the food or cosmetics industry.eggXYt is one of a number of startups working on this issue, but is unique in its non-invasive, pre-incubation method. Using CRISPR, a gene editing tool, they insert a detectable biomarker into the laying chicken's DNA which marks the gender of the eggs without any side effects. The laid eggs are then sent through a scanner that identifies the male eggs because of their light fluorescent glow. ""Its accuracy rate is very high and it has no effect on the hatchability of the female eggs. And it leaves the industry with the seven billion male unincubated eggs as a product rather than waste,"" says Elram.While eggXYt would not disclose its value, the company was granted $4 million in grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority, EU Horizon 2020 and other awards, says Elram. Its technology is currently undergoing regulatory approval. Personal healthAnother major trend dominating Israel's food tech arena is health, with firms like Amai Proteins and DouxMatok developing sugar alternatives.Or MyFavorEats, a Tel Aviv-based startup, which has developed an algorithm that customizes online recipes, suggesting alternatives when ingredients are unavailable or tailoring it to a user's dietary requirements. ""For example, a diabetic, who needs to keep a certain amount of carbohydrates per dish, or a professional sports person, who is counting proteins,"" says Orly Rapaport, the company's CEO. The algorithm, trained on 1 million recipes, has learned to recognize the role of each ingredient and its taste and texture parameters. Though not yet on the market, the technology will be available through wellness and health apps or recipe publishers. Not only does this cater to the growing trend of veganism and vegetarianism, but also to the rising prevalence of food allergies. The World Allergy Organization estimates that between 240 and 550 million people suffer from food allergies worldwide. "

The layoffs will skew towards technology and operations roles, the source said.Morgan Stanley plans to take a charge of approximately $150 million to $200 million because of the layoffs, a person familiar with the matter said.The flurry of pink slips comes as Wall Street firms face pressure to restrain spending to offset a challenging environment of low interest rates, slow economic growth and vanishing volatility in financial markets. And it comes as traditional bank jobs are being disrupted by artificial intelligence and other new technologies.Morgan Stanley's compensation expenses crept higher during the third quarter even as revenue was sluggish. ""We remain committed to controlling our expenses,"" CEO James Gorman said at the time. Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the job cuts, which were first reported by CNBC.Some European banks have also eliminated jobs in a bid to control costs. In July, Deutsche Bank (DB) launched a dramatic overhaul aimed at slashing the troubled German lender's workforce by 18,000.During a conference call with analysts in October, Gorman said that while business executives ""remain confident"" in the US economy, they are also worried about whether trade negotiations will stay within the ""guardrails of reasonableness."" He added, ""Nobody wants to see a global economic slowdown.""Recession fears have eased in recent weeks on signs that much of the US economy is proving resilient to the US-China trade war. Although America's manufacturing industry is in a downturn, the rest of the economy continues to grow. The United States added 266,000 jobs in November, blowing away estimates from economists. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5%, matching a 50-year low.Still, the financial services industry is bracing for significant disruption caused by the rise of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation. For instance, by 2030, about 1.3 million bank workers in the United States and 500,000 in the United Kingdom could be affected by the introduction of AI, according to IHS Markit. Bank workers who will be affected through layoffs and reassignments include bank tellers, customer service representatives, loan interviewers, compliance officers and loan officers, IHS said.Finance is likewise exposed to these technology trends because banks spend $150 billion per year on technology -- more than any other industry, according to an October study by Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo.The number of jobs on Wall Street and the banking industry could decline by about 200,000 over the next decade, the report predicted. ""New job additions could make the reductions less but our conclusion is still that this will be the biggest reduction in US bank headcount in history,"" he wrote. "
Coca-Cola Energy is coming to the United States,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/business/coke-energy-us-launch/index.html,"The beverage company will start selling four varieties of its energy drink â€” Coca-Cola Energy, Coca-Cola Energy Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Energy Cherry and Coca-Cola Energy Cherry Zero Sugar â€” in the United States in mid-January. Coke Energy and Coke Energy Zero Sugar are already available internationally, but the cherry flavor is new. The new product is designed to help Coke to introduce Coca-Cola (KO) drinkers, who may not consume energy drinks, to a growing category. It's also a way for the company to make sure that its core Coca-Cola brand remains fresh.  But first, Coca-Cola has to make sure drinkers understand just what Coke Energy is. A boost of energy Coca-Cola Energy has 114 mg of caffeine in each 12-ounce serving.That's nearly four times the caffeine in a can of regular Coca-Cola (34 mg), and three times the caffeine in a can of Diet Coke (46 mg).It will be more expensive, too: Coca-Cola Energy will have a recommended price of $2.49 per 12-ounce container. Similarly-sized regular Cokes are generally sold in packs of 12, and cost about $4 per package (about 33 cents each). In the United States, total energy drink and energy shot sales reached about $13.5 billion in 2018, up 30% from 2013, according to a report from research group Mintel. The sector could have sales of about $17 billion in 2023, Mintel projects.Coke drinkers aren't really in on the trend, according to Coca-Cola Brand Director Janki Gambhir. ""Many consumers that drink Coke don't engage in the energy category today,"" she told CNN Business, noting that they still may be interested. ""A lot of the work that we will do will be focused around educating consumers,"" she said. To figure out how to make Coke Energy work in the United States, the company spoke with more than 1,100 people â€” including energy drink consumers and those that don't regularly drink the beverage â€” to make sure that it delivers what people want. The company plans to introduce the product by advertising it through television commercials and billboards, as well as handing out samples. With Coca-Cola Energy, the company hopes to boost sales within the Coke brand rather than steal share from other energy drinks or Coke flavors. Coca-Cola owns about 18% of Monster Energy, and has a strategic partnership with the company. In addition to giving Coca-Cola another way into the energy sector, Coke Energy can help make sure people don't stop drinking Coke. Keeping Coke currentCoca-Cola has ambitions of being a ""global beverage company."" It sells iced tea, juice, water, coffee and smoothies. But Coke is its core business, and only a few years ago the Coke brand was stagnating. To boost the brand, Coca-Cola has given Diet Coke a millennial-friendly makeover, launched a new flavor and, for a limited time, brought back New Coke in partnership with Netflix's ""Stranger Things."" Coca-Cola Energy and Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, which is for now only available internationally, are more ways to keep people excited about cola. So far, Coca-Cola's efforts to revitalize its core brand seem to be working. Second quarter sales were driven in part by 4% global growth in trademark Coca-Cola, the company said. And international sales of Coke Energy are ""encouraging,"" said CEO James Quincey in a July call discussing the quarter's financial results .Coca-Cola hopes that Coke Energy will be a continued source of long term growth, said Gambhir, adding that there is a ""pipeline full of new flavors"" and other innovations for the platform.

It recently reached a confidential agreement with Boeing on compensation for the grounding, the company said in a statement. Southwest has canceled about 175 weekday flights due to the loss of the jet, and it has had higher fuel costs from flying less fuel efficient planes in place of the Max. In its most recent financial report it said that the worldwide grounding, which began in March, cost it $435 million through the end of September.Since the airline has a profit sharing plan, its employees would lose out on pay even if the airline were compensated in full by Boeing. But Southwest said Thursday it will add $125 million to its profit sharing pool with money it gets from Boeing.""Our people have done an incredible job managing through the Max groundings, while providing the highest levels of customer service and one of the best operational performances in our history,"" said Southwest CEO Gary Kelly. ""On behalf of the Southwest board of directors, we are grateful to our employees for their extraordinary efforts throughout the year and are pleased to share proceeds from our recent agreement with Boeing.""Nearly 400 of the Boeing 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. In July, Boeing took a $5 billion charge to account for the compensation it would have to pay airlines, but the expected length of the grounding has grown since then, and the compensation cost is expected to grow as well. But Boeing's hopes to get the plane approved to fly again before the end of the year were dashed yesterday when Stephen Dickson, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said the agency's review process would stretch into 2020.Boeing (BA) is also being sued by the pilots union at Southwest, as its members who were slated to fly the 737 Max have lost pay due to the canceled flights. The suit, filed in October, put lost wages at $115 million at that time."
Coca-Cola thinks Americans are finally ready for Coke with coffee,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/business/coke-with-coffee/index.html,"Bad timing caused the failure, said Nancy Quan, the company's chief technical officer. ""That was a trend before its time,"" Quan told CNN Business. ""I don't think people were ready to have a coffee portfolio within the Coca-Cola brand."" Now, thanks to evolving trends and palates, the company thinks the public is ready. And Coca-Cola is bringing Blak back â€” sort of. Over the past few years, Coke has been releasing a similar product called Coca-Cola Plus Coffee or Coca-Cola With Coffee in international markets. The new product contains more real coffee than Blak did. There's also an additional caffeine jolt: The product is more caffeinated than regular Coke.Today, it's available in Australia, Italy, Spain, Thailand and Poland, among other countries. Coca-Cola is ""pleased with the initial response,"" according to a spokesperson. It plans to make the drink available in 25 international markets by the end of the year. The company hasn't committed to bringing the product to the United States. But it's ""optimistic about the potential for the beverage"" in the country, a spokesperson said. ""I believe that there's going to be a space for a Coca-Cola With Coffee"" in the United States, Javier Meza, Coca-Cola's global chief marketing officer of sparkling beverages, told CNN Business. He said the product could reach the United States next year. The beverage company evaluates geographical markets separately. Products that succeed internationally don't always work in the United States. But Meza said that ""Coca-Cola With Coffee is not a concept that consumers were expecting"" in any market, calling it ""surprising."" That's a good thing, he added: ""Sometimes consumers think that they have seen everything.""  Coca-Cola (KO) needs to keep innovating with its flagship product to succeed, and Coke Plus Coffee can help â€” even if it takes some getting used to. Why Coca-Cola needs soda Coca-Cola Plus Coffee tastes a bit like a coffee-flavored candy â€” as sweet as regular Coca-Cola, with an added coffee kick. And while Blak was packaged distinctly, the new drink is clearly a Coca-Cola beverage. Selling a new type of product within the signature Coke brand is important to the company. Consumer tastes are splintering. Sugar-conscious customers are turning to water, seltzer and beverages that offer a nutritional or energy boost. Coca-Cola, which aims to be a ""total beverage company,"" invests in a broad range of products to entice those customers. But soda remains Coca-Cola's most lucrative business. Last year, Coca-Cola's sales of carbonated drinks â€” which include carbonated fruit juices and sodas, but exclude seltzer â€” reached $15.4 billion in the United States, according to the research firm Euromonitor International. That's up about $1 billion from 2013. In the United States, soda ""remains one of the largest non-alcoholic beverage markets,"" according to the summary of a recent report by the research firm Mintel. But it's a sluggish business. The carbonated soft drink market is ""characterized by general stagnation rather than steep decline,"" Mintel noted. To promote soda sales, Coca-Cola is shrinking cans (a way to reduce calories without altering taste) and launching new flavors under the Coke brand. It's also adding an energy drink. And then there's Coca-Cola Plus Coffee. By launching new beverages under the Coca-Cola trademark, rather than as discrete new products, Coca-Cola is ""leveraging the power of the Coca-Cola brand,"" Meza said, and delivering on the company's promise to refresh and energize consumers. It's also trying to keep people from straying away from colas by offering different variations of the company's signature product. And with coffee, Coca-Cola hopes to capitalize on a powerful trend. Bringing coffee backThere's reason to believe that consumers are finally ready for a Coke and coffee product.The beverage landscape has evolved since Coca-Cola tried selling Blak. People are more accustomed to blurred categories, or products that don't fall strictly into one category, Meza noted. Sparkling juices or juice-tea blends are examples of the trend.And coffee itself is more popular. In 2006, Starbucks (SBUX) had about 12,400 stores â€” this year, it opened its 30,000th store. Starbucks helped Americans develop a taste for coffee, said Laurent Grandet, a consumer analyst with Guggenheim Securities.wit""Coffee is very trendy right now,"" he said. In 2006, when Coca-Cola launched Blak, ""coffee was not as big.""Coca-Cola's interest in coffee extends beyond this product â€” the beverage company announced last year its acquisition of the European coffee chain Costa Coffee. The deal closed this year. ""Coke really believes they need to be in coffee in a big way,"" said Macquarie analyst Caroline Levy. ""They're going to come at it from lots of different angles and figure out what works.""  Meza doesn't expect Coke Plus Coffee to be as big as regular Coke. But ""there's going to be a segment of consumers that are going to be willing to try this product,"" he said. And over the next five to ten years he expects Coke Plus Coffee to be a ""sizable part of the portfolio."" "
NestlÃ© launches vegan alternative to bacon,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/business/nestle-vegan-bacon-cheese/index.html,"New York  (CNN Business)NestlÃ© is leaning into the plant-based trend with vegan alternatives to bacon and cheddar cheese. The global food company said on Wednesday that it will start selling the products to its restaurant and food service clients in the United States and Europe next year. The announcement follows the launch of NestlÃ©'s Awesome Burger, a plant-based patty that looks and tastes like meat. With the three new products, NestlÃ© is carving out a space for itself in the rapidly expanding plant-based market.  Consumers, concerned about their health and the environment are increasingly incorporating plant-based products to their diets. US retail sales of plant-based foods have grown 11% in the past year, according to a July report from trade group Plant Based Foods Association and the Good Food Institute. Barclays predicts the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales over the next decade, capturing about 10% of the global meat industry, up from $14 billion currently. Jefferies predicts that by 2040, the alternative meat market could generate $240 billion in annual revenue globally.For the most part, the meatless burger market has been dominated by two young companies: Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat (BYND). Recently, however, big established food companies have launched or announced their own products: Kroger (KR) is introducing its own plant-based products, from burger patties to Bolognese sauce to sour cream, this fall. Hormel Foods (HRL), maker of Skippy, Spam and AppleGate, has also introduced a line of plant-based and blended products, as has Tyson (TSN), one of the world's biggest meat, pork and poultry processors. And Kellogg (K) plans to launch a line of meat substitutes called Incogmeato under its Morningstar Farms brand next year.And as competition heats up, NestlÃ© (NSRGY) may be looking for an edge by offering all of the ingredients a restaurant would need for a vegan bacon cheeseburger. ""We have now raised the bar by developing a 'PB triple play' of ingredients for an all-time classic: the bacon cheeseburger,"" NestlÃ© CEO Mark Schneider said in a statement. NestlÃ© designed the new bacon and cheese alternatives specifically for use in professional kitchens, the company explained. It's also offering restaurants vegan sauces to go with the burger. Plenty of restaurants have started selling menu items that feature plant-based meat alternatives â€” but those meals aren't fully vegan. Dunkin's (DNKN) breakfast sandwiches, made with Beyond Meat sausages, also come with animal products like egg and cheese. Little Caesars tested the Impossible sausage on a cheese pizza. That's because those testing out meat substitutes so far tend to be meat eaters who see plant-based alternatives as a way to eat less meat, rather than abandon it altogether. Still, if restaurants want to sell a fully vegan product, sourcing from one provider could make it easier. For NestlÃ©, the new products are also a way to deliver on a promise to reach zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Plant-based alternatives to meat use significantly less water and release far fewer emissions than animal products."
Why you won't fly on a 737 Max again for quite some time,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/10/business/boeing-deliveries-orders/index.html,"Boeing has said it still hopes to get its fixes for the plane approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration by the end of the year. But it has been pushing back that target date continually for months, and it acknowledges the decision rests with the FAA, not with the company. The FAA has not yet given a timeline for approval.More clarity about that approval process could come on Wednesday when FAA administrator Stephen Dickson testifies before a house committee on the agency's oversight of the certification process. The hearing comes in the wake of report by NBC quoting a Boeing whistleblower saying that he warned the aircraft maker of problems with the plane months ahead of the crash. Once the plane is approved to fly again by the FAA, it will still take months of additional pilot training before most of the planes are flying again on US routes. The three US carriers with the planes, Southwest (LUV), American (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), don't expect to increase their schedules to account for the return of the plane until at least March. And it could be even longer before they are flying on routes in other countries, where most of them were based. The airline industry expects aviation regulators around the globe to approve process in phases â€” not all at once. The delays will increase the compensation that Boeing will eventually have to pay to its airline customers, which have not been able to fly their planes since March.The planes were grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people were tied to an automatic safety feature on the jets. But Boeing continued to build the jets, at a slightly reduced pace of 42 a month. It just wasn't able to deliver the the nearly 400 jets it has parked waiting to be delivered.Tuesday, Boeing gave its most recent sales and delivery figures for November and for 2019. At the Dubai air show last month, Boeing received its first firm orders for the 737 Max since the grounding. But Max deliveries are down 51% this year compared to the same period in 2018. Most of the money that Boeing collects from airlines comes when the plane is delivered. Boeing's orders for all of its planes, including the Max, are down 66% this year. The Max accounts for most of that drop. But orders for other models also declined 14% this year.The deliveries of the 737 Max planes that have been built since the grounding will take even longer to get in the air. Boeing has said it anticipates delays in getting those new 737 Max plains in the air will stretch into 2021.Part of that delay is because the airlines aren't ready to accept hundreds of additional planes at one time. But it is also because the FAA now plans to inspect each aircraft, rather than letting Boeing perform the pre-delivery checks as it has in the past.Monday, Cai von Rumohr, one of the dwindling number of analysts with a ""buy"" recommendation on the stock, cut his price target by 6% because of the continued delays in getting the completed planes delivered to customers.Rumohr said in his note to investors that the approval process could drag into January. He said the FAA's decision to perform the pre-delivery checks suggests deliveries will resume gradually instead of in one fell swoop. He said it's possible that the deliveries of inventoried Max jets will go beyond 2021, perhaps all the way to mid-2022."
4 consumer brands that came back from the dead,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/dead-brands-revived-list/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Everything old is new again â€” especially in retail.Once-popular stores have disappeared as the retail industry is faced with a major upheaval. Online shopping and changing consumer tastes have wrecked some retail brands, forcing some iconic companies out of business. But some of them don't stay dead forever. Reviving an old and well-known brand is an easy way for companies to re-enter a sector without starting from scratch, according to Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail.""There is a view that businesses can capitalize on the memory of the old brands and make them work again,"" he told CNN Business, albeit in a different format, such as a smaller footprint or exclusively online. ""Whether the above works or not very much depends on how strong the brand is and how much it is needed and wanted by consumers,"" Saunders said. Here are four brands that have been recently revived.1. GymboreeThe children's clothing brand is the latest company to get a second life. Rival retailer The Children's Place announced in October that it's bringing back Gymboree as a website and as a ""shop-in-a-shop"" at more than 200 of its stores early next year. The revitalization comes after Children's Place spent $76 million acquiring the failed brand in March following its bankruptcy.As a rebooted brand, Gymboree promises to be more digitally focused than its predecessor, with free shipping and a new app. 2. Toys 'R' UsThe country's most recognizable toy store went out of business in the United States last year. But its new owner, Tru Kids Brands, is bringing it back--with some major changes.At 6,500 square feet, the new locations are a fraction the size of their predecessors, which ranged from 20,000 to 50,000 square feet. Tru Kids describes the new stores as a ""highly engaging retail experience designed for kids, families and to better fit within today's retail environment."" Unlike the rows and rows of shelves that cluttered old Toys ""R"" Us stores, the new locations will have interactive and playground-like environments for toy brands.There will only two of them to begin, with the first ones opening in New Jersey and Texas before the holidays. Toys ""R"" Us still exists in other parts of the world, including Canada, Europe, Asia and India. 3. FAO SchwarzAnother toy store knocked out of existence was FAO Schwarz. It closed its most famous location in New York's Fifth Avenue in 2015 after shuttering all of its other stores.Consumer products company ThreeSixty Group, which also owns Sharper Image, acquired FAO from Toys ""R"" Us in 2016. Two years later, it opened a 20,000-square-foot store at 30 Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan and plans to expand into airports.4. American Apparel American Apparel, known for its racy ads, fired its controversial founder and CEO, Dov Charney, twice in 2014 amid allegations of mismanagement and violations of the company's sexual harassment policies. At one point, American Apparel had nearly 200 stores open worldwide before it filed for bankruptcy in 2016. Gildan Activewear (GIL) revived the brand in 2017 when it purchased company's trademark during the bankruptcy process. The Canadian company opened a physical store in Los Angeles in 2018 and still sells clothes online."
The simple reason Tariff Man keeps coming back,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/business/trade-war-trump-china-france/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)President Donald Trump, armed with sweeping tax cuts and a handpicked Federal Reserve chief, confidently told the world in March 2018 that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" Nearly two years later, the United States is bogged down in a trade war with China -- a battle that may erupt just in time for Christmas. Trump, who has proudly called himself Tariff Man, suggested Tuesday that a trade agreement with China may not happen until after the 2020 election. That warning dashed hopes on Wall Street for imminent trade peace, driving the Dow 450 points, or 1.5%, lower. And just this week Trump opened several new fronts in the global trade war. He vowed to lob tariffs on steel made in Brazil and Argentina. And he threatened tariffs of up to 100% on French cheese, handbags and champagne.""No one is safe from Tariff Man,"" Chris Krueger, managing director at the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients. Tariff Man's return exposes the flawed trade logic at work here. It is impossible to fight trade wars, especially on multiple fronts, without harming the world's interconnected economy.  ""Trade wars are hard, and everybody loses,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. ""As many generals have noted over the centuries, it's very difficult to fight a war on multiple fronts.""It's not just the direct cost of the tariffs, which act as a tax on consumers and businesses. The real pain is inflicted by the deep uncertainty over the timing, severity and even location of the trade war. It paralyzes business investment.""It's a pretty straightforward equation: More uncertainty means less economic growth and less hiring,"" said Kelly, adding that the Trump administration ""seems to be completely missing"" that point. NY Fed: Tariffs are paid by US firms, consumersAnd yet the White House is now signaling that the US-China trade war might get worse before it gets better.""In some ways, I think it's better to wait for after the election, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump told reporters in London on Tuesday. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC that the US has more ""ammunition"" left against China. He warned that the December 15 tariffs on consumer-facing imports from China will take effect ""unless there is some reason to postpone them."" To be sure, the Trump administration is trying to address legitimate and serious problems with China's trade practices. There is a real cost to China's alleged theft of corporate secrets and other nontrade barriers. And China likely wouldn't be talking about beefing up its intellectual property protections if it weren't for Trump's tariffs.  Trump has argued that the cost of tariffs are paid by China, not the US. However, that would only be the case if Chinese companies sharply lowered their dollar prices--which they haven't. The New York Federal Reserve found in a report last month that import prices for goods from China haven't budged much.""The continued stability of import prices for goods from China means US firms and consumers have to pay the tariff tax,"" the NY Fed economists wrote. Manufacturing downturn worsensEscalation of the trade war will only add to pain for America's factories. Hurt by weak global growth and the trade war, the US manufacturing industry contracted in November for the fourth month in a row, according to the Institute for Supply Management.""If we're going to go all in on tariffs, it's going to have a negative effect on the economy,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation. Trump has repeatedly blamed the factory turmoil on the Federal Reserve, which is led by Jerome Powell, the president's own nominee. ""Manufacturers are being held back by the strong Dollar, which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the Federal Reserve,"" Trump tweeted Monday. However, the strong dollar was mentioned only once in the ISM survey, which singled out ""global trade"" as the No. 1 problem for manufacturers.""Markets have downshifted further. The continued confusion surrounding China trade has kept export markets on edge,"" one wood products maker said in the ISM survey.Spillover riskManufacturing makes up just a small part of America's consumer-led economy. That's why the decade-long economic expansion has survived multiple factory downturns. The service sector, which includes banks, restaurants and law firms, has slowed but not contracted because consumer spending remains sturdy, as evidenced by the strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.Still, there is a risk that the trade war will eventually infect the rest of the economy through weaker hiring or slower consumer spending. That's why it's important to watch how the stock market reacts to the latest developments in the trade war. A severe market drop could spook CEOs and households alike.Investors had been betting on a preliminary trade agreement -- one that Trump himself suggested as late as last week was close. Trade hopes helped fuel a melt-up that carried the S&P 500 to 11 record highs in November alone. Not only was Wall Street hoping the December 15 tariffs would be averted, but investors were also expecting a rollback of existing tariffs. Now there is growing unease that a trade deal may not happen until 2020--or later.""It feels like we might be getting to one of those inflection points where things are going to get worse, not better,"" said National Securities' Hogan. ""The market has to recalibrate to that.That recalibration has begun. The Dow has plunged more than 700 points, or nearly 3%, over the past three trading days. ""Forecast for 2020: There will be no settlement in the Trump Trade War, nor will there be a reduction in China-US tensions,"" David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, wrote in a note on Tuesday. So much for trade wars being easy to win."
This is Taco Bell's answer to the chicken sandwich wars,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/business/taco-bell-crispy-chicken-trnd/index.html," (CNN)Have we reached crispy chicken sandwich fatigue yet? Because Taco Bell wants in, even though  its entry into the fast food wars isn't really a sandwich at all. The house of Doritos Locos Tacos and the mystifying Crunchwrap Supreme is scaling back the theatrics with Crispy Tortilla Chicken -- aka, chicken strips breaded with jalapeno buttermilk and tortilla chips. By Taco Bell standards, this dish might even be considered pedestrian. Notably one of the few menu items without ""supreme"" in the title, the strips can be enjoyed rolled up in a soft taco or dunked heartily into some dip, the chain says. You won't find any buttered brioche buns at this establishment. The spicy strips may not pose an immediate threat to Popeyes' now legendary chicken sandwich.They're rolling out at Taco Bells in Dayton, Ohio, and Houston before declaring worldwide domination. Will Crispy Tortilla Chicken inspire the same fanfare as its chicken sandwich competitors? It's too soon to say. But with a starting price of $1.99 for the taco version, at least any long waits in line won't cost much. "
Walmart wants robots in stores. Target doesn't,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/business/walmart-target-robots-automation-retail-jobs/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Walmart and Target are taking different approaches to adding robots in stores, a split that will have an impact on the companies' massive workforces and shape the future of automation in retail. Both of these legacy brick-and-mortar companies are testing robots in their warehouses.  Walmart (WMT), the country's largest retailer and private employer, expects to add self-driving robots that scrub floors to 1,860 of its more-than 4,700 US stores by February. It will also add robots that scan shelf inventory at 350 stores and bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts.Walmart's 178,000-square-foot supercenters are expensive to operate, especially as more shoppers shift online. The company is adding robots to help it increase worker productivity and control costs. Walmart has around one million hourly workers in its stores. The company says ""smart assistants"" will reduce the amount of time workers spend on ""repeatable, predictable and manual"" tasks in stores, allowing workers to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles. With the robots, Walmart will reduce the hours it assigns workers to unloading boxes and mopping the floors in some stores. That will lead to some employee attrition over time, the company says.Grocery chains are also using robots in their stores. Stop & Shop and Giant Food Stores, owned by Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize, are placing ""Marty,"" a tall, gray robot with googly eyes, in close to 500 stores. The bot roams around stores looking for spills. Albertsons is also testing a shelf-scanning robot in a few stores. However, Target (TGT), which has around 1,850 US stores and 360,000 workers, has eschewed a robot-worker strategy.The retailer has added self-checkout and automatic cash-counting machines to hundreds of stores in recent years. But Target CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday his chain will not bring on the type of robots Walmart has deployed in stores.""You won't see robots in Target stores anytime soon. We really think, even in today's environment, where people are talking about AI and robotics and different elements of technology, the human touch still really matters,"" Cornell said. Target announced it would spend an extra $50 million in payroll hours during the holidays.   Carl Benedikt Frey, fellow at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University and author of The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor and Power in the Age of Automation, said it makes less economic sense for Target to invest in robots than Walmart because it has fewer workers and smaller stores. More than 80% of Target's stores are under 170,000-square-feet.""Tractors were first adopted on larger farms and only later trickled down to some mid-sized ones as prices dropped,"" said Frey. ""The same is true of robots in warehouses and retail stores.""Polarizing issueWalmart and Target's strategies are playing out as worker and public concern about automation grows.According to a 2017 Pew Research survey, 85% of Americans support measures to restrict robots. Andrew Yang, Democratic candidate for president, has made protecting workers against automation a pillar of his campaign.  There are more than 15 million retail workers in America today, and lower-skilled jobs in the industry such as cashiers and clerks are among those vulnerable to technology advances.Between 6 million to 7.5 million existing retail jobs are at risk of being replaced over the course of the next 10 years by some form of automation, estimated financial services firm Cornerstone Capital Group in a 2017 study.In the retail industry, ""margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice,"" according to McKinsey analysts. ""Automation will disproportionately disrupt retail.""Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents some workers at Stop & Shop and Giant, said that companies that automate certain tasks are not ""'freeing up' staff to work with customers."" ""The truth is, they are de-skilling jobs and cutting workers' hours to make a buck providing less service to customers and chipping away at good jobs for hardworking people,"" he said. Automation is changing the nature of retail work, experts and Walmart leaders say.Martin Block, executive director of the Retail Analytics Council and professor at Northwestern University, said robots in stores will increase demand for retail workers, ""transitioning them to doing different tasks, especially spending more time with customers.""  ""As we evolve, there are certain activities, certain jobs that'll go away, but new jobs will be created,"" Walmart US CFO Michael Dastugue said at an analyst conference in March.Walmart expects to use some of the hours it saves because of the robots to assign workers to newly-created roles, such as selecting customers' grocery pickup and delivery orders. Walmart has created 50,000 of these new types of jobs over the past three years.""We're looking at our jobs through the lens of technology and asking ourselves which human tasks add value â€” and which should be automated,"" CEO Doug McMillon said last year. ""The workplace is going to look different in a few years â€” not just in retail, but across the economy.""Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the month in which Walmart US CFO Michael Dastugue talked about shifts in Walmart jobs."

Beer sales are slipping. Here's what Americans are drinking instead,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/business/alcohol-trends-2019-beer-sales/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Beer is in a bear market. Domestic brews, such as Budweiser, Coors Light and Miller Light, once dominated the US beverage market. But sales are declining while alternatives are spiking. Drinkers think beer is stale, compared to the innovative new brands and creative concepts emerging from other places, so they are craving a variety of other boozy drinks, including premium liquor, canned wine, spiked seltzers and pre-made bottled cocktails. In 2018, alcohol consumption in the United States dropped for the third-straight year, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. And beer is to blame: Sales of a case of beer declined 1.5%. For the past five years, beer volume in the US declined 2.4%, the firm said. The trend doesn't appear to be reversing itself. Sales of domestic beer slipped 4.6% between October 2018 and October 2019, according to Nielsen. Microbrew and craft beers are also in a minor slump, down 0.4%, despite Big Beer companies scooping them up left and right (AnheuserBusch just purchased Craft Brew Alliance, which makes Redhook Ale).But people are still drinking â€” a lot. Alternative drink categories that both firms tracked have all grown. With traditional beer getting the boot, here's what people are drinking instead.Spiked seltzerPerhaps no other alcoholic drinks had more of a breakout year than White Claw because people are seeking drinks lower in sugar and calories. The spiked seltzer brand exploded over the summer and shows no signs of slowing down. Sales cracked $1.2 billion for the previous 52 weeks ending on October 5 â€” a nearly 200% jump in growth year over year.Although White Claw remains the United States' top-selling spiked seltzer brand, rival brands have also found success. Truly, which is produced Boston Beer (SAM), is also growing in popularity. Analysts at Guggenheim said in a recent report that Truly is driving ""more than 100% of the company's retail growth"" and is helping the company, which makes Sam Adams lager, beer-proof itself. In contrast, the company's flagship beer, Samuel Adams, sales fell 11% and its 60 Minute IPA fell 14% for a 12-week period ending on November 2, according to Guggenheim. The spiked seltzer fever has also caught on with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD). It has two well-established brands, Bon & Viv and the beer-and-fruit flavored Natural Light seltzer, with plans to add a third based off its Bud Light brand. Bud Light Seltzer ""falls in a spot in between our other seltzer brands,"" meaning it will be more expensive than Natural Light and cheaper than Bon & Viv. It's scheduled to launch in early 2020. Canned wineThe portability and attractive price point of canned wine has helped sparked a new trend. Nielsen reports a 73% jump in sales between October 2018 and October 2019, totaling $54 million. Seattle-based Precept Wine has helped grow the space with its line of brands, including selling its popular House Wine in a can in 2017. CEO and founder Andrew Browne told CNN Business that the idea came from its customers seeking portable wine for social events, like boating and tailgating. The company told CNN Business that its canned wines sales are doubling the industry growth average, according to data it obtained from Nielsen. It has expanded its line of canned drinks to a wine spritzer brand, called Day Drinking with country brand Little Big Town.It's mulling an expansion of flavors, including fruit flavors and sangria. Precept Wine is projecting to sell 300,000 cases of all of its canned wine brands by end of year.Growth in the sector has also attracted the attention of AB InBev. In July, the brewer bought Babe Wine, a company co-founded by popular Instagram influencer Josh ""The Fat Jewish"" Ostrovsky and brothers David Oliver Cohen and Tanner Cohen. They are the writers behind the Babe Walker @whitegrlproblem Twitter account.Babe sells its pinot grigio, rosÃ© and red wines in cans. Terms of the purchase were not disclosed but a source close to the deal previously told CNN Business that it is AB InBev's biggest investment in wine to date.Pre-made cocktailsPopular overseas, the pre-made cocktail trend is finally hitting the states. A mix of established alcohol companies and startups are looking to enter the growing space. Sales of prepared cocktails, which includes drinks in glass, canned and plastic bottles, jumped 17% to $323 million between October 2018 and October 2019, according to Nielsen.Haus, a startup that aims to be the ""Warby Parker of alcohol,"" is one stylish direct-to-consumer brand that entered the sector this year. Haus cofounder and co-CEO Helena Price Hambrecht told CNN Business that their bottled cocktail company was created for what a new generation of drinkers want â€” a drink with natural ingredients and lower alcohol content.  ""They're perfect as a cocktail base or on their own, and they're designed for the generation that loves the social ritual of gathering, but wants a little less booze,"" she said of the brand's drinks that have a third of alcohol content of hard liquor. Haus sells two drinks: Citrus Flower and Bitter Clove, each costing $35 per bottle. The company declined to disclose specific sales numbers, but said it has received ""several thousand"" orders since launching in June. Premium liquorSpirits from whiskey to tequila grew for the ninth straight year in 2018, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a national trade organization that represents distilled spirits makers in the US. The trend is still growing this year, according to Nielsen. Spirits sales grew 6% to $15 billion from October 2018 to October 2019, according to Nielsen. Tequila grew the most at 13%, whiskey was in second at nearly 8% and vodka jumped 3%.Jack Daniels-maker Brown-Forman (BFA) continued to have a strong year. In its most recent earnings report, its portfolio of super-premium American whiskeys, including Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack and its tequila brands, led by Herradura, all had double digit percentage increases. CFO Jane Morreau said in its earnings call that the company expects to deliver another year of ""solid results."" --CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner and Paul R.

SpaceX wants to beam internet from space. This could be its biggest hurdle,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/business/spacex-starlink-antenna-user-terminal-scn/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)SpaceX wants to be your next Wi-Fi provider. It's hoping to build a constellation of satellites to deliver cheap, lightning-quick broadband from space â€” and the toughest obstacle could be on the ground.The company took major steps this year by launching the first 100-plus satellites for its network, called Starlink, with an eye toward growing the constellation to include more than 10,000 devices that will blanket the planet in internet connectivity. SpaceX executives hope initial service could roll out in parts of the United States next year.The path ahead is filled with risk and uncertainty. Starlink is essentially a multibillion-dollar bet that Elon Musk's company can deploy a technology that others have tried and failed to build in the past. And the service's success depends only partly on whether SpaceX can deploy thousands of satellites without running out of money.Perhaps a bigger and more difficult question, according to industry experts, is how people will access the network. Starlink customers would need user terminals, or high-tech antennas they can stick on their roofs or in their yards to establish a useable internet connection. The necessary technology exists. But if SpaceX wants to attract consumers, it needs to build user terminals that are affordable, reliable and low maintenance â€” a massive undertaking. SpaceX's chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, said during a recent meeting with reporters that the company is putting ""a lot of engineering"" resources into developing user terminals.""Because if we don't get it right,"" she said, ""we're in deep doo-doo.""Why are ground terminals important?Even as traditional internet infrastructure has expanded rapidly in recent years, about half the global population still lacks consistent internet access, including millions of people in the United States. Traditional Wi-Fi and cell services rely on an enormous web of underground cables and cell towers. It would be extremely expensive and time-consuming to connect billions of people using only ground-based technologies.That's why there's big interest in using satellites to blanket the globe with an affordable network. And it's not a new idea.In the 1990s, several well-funded ventures attempted to build satellite constellations similar to Starlink. All of them either changed plans, went bankrupt or liquidated after realizing it would be impractical or too expensive.SpaceX is among a new crop of companies â€” which include Amazon and Softbank-backed OneWeb â€” that are trying again. They expect to be successful this time because satellites and rockets are cheaper than ever. While deploying a satellite internet constellation will be far from easy, that effort would be less likely to end in bankruptcy.Ground equipment may pose one of the biggest obstacle to success.Antenna technology has come a long way since the 1990s. But even some industry leaders say it'll still be extremely difficult to build user terminals at the volume and price points that SpaceX will need to turn a profit.One source involved in Teledesic, a now-defunct internet constellation business backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, said that the company learned the hard way not to underestimate the difficulty of building user terminals. It was a key reason why the venture folded in the early 2000s, the source said. In fact, it was ""probably"" the main reason, the source said.Why are the antennas so hard?Space-based data services already exist. They're powered primarily by massive satellites in geosynchronous orbit more than 20,000 miles from Earth. At that distance, objects orbit at the same speed as the Earth turns, meaning satellites can stay positioned over a specific area of land and provide uninterrupted service.That could be ideal for telecom services like Dish Network, which provides customers with simple antennas that sit atop their roofs. They can point at the same satellite day and night.But that system doesn't work well for internet service. Geostationary satellites require data to travel the 20,000 miles and back whenever a user clicks a link, which can cause frustrating lag times.SpaceX and its competitors want their internet constellations orbiting much closer to the ground. In Starlink's case, thousands of satellites would circle 340 miles overhead, working to deliver internet speeds rivaling the fastest ground-based services.How cheap do they need to be?Bill Milroy is the chief technology officer at US-based antenna maker ThinKom, which makes computer-controlled antennas â€” called ""phased array"" â€” that steer themselves to maintain a connection with a satellite as it streaks across the sky. The company's antennas are currently used in commercial airplanes and are used to relay in-flight Wi-Fi to passengers.Milroy said it's impossible to know exactly how expensive it would be to mass produce the kinds of user terminals that SpaceX will need.It's a classic chicken-and-egg problem: You won't know how cheap they will be to manufacture until you know how many you're building, and you can't gauge demand until you've priced the terminals.Milroy said that if Elon Musk called him tomorrow and told him to build user terminals as cheaply as possible, ThinKom could probably get the cost down to about $1,000 each, about as much as an iPhone 11.At those prices, Starlink might be able to win over some Americans unhappy with their current internet providers.But, Milroy added, he doesn't believe SpaceX will attract customers in the mostly poor areas that still lack internet access. The company would probably need to get user terminal prices down to about $150 a piece, or what ""a cheapo phone in India costs,"" to make a significant impact, Milroy said.""We don't think anybody's ready to hit those kinds of price targets,"" he added.SpaceX doesn't plan to buy user terminals made by others. In typical fashion, the company will keep design and production in house.Shotwell, the SpaceX COO, said a team of engineers have started a prototype production line at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. They ""still have a lot of work to do,"" she said.SpaceX has proven on more than one occasion that it can get the job done. And Milroy, the ThinKom CTO, echoed what many others in the industry have said after expressing skepticism about Starlink: ""I certainly don't want to bet against SpaceX."""
Burger King sued for cooking Impossible Whopper alongside meat,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/burger-king-impossible-burger-lawsuit-trnd/index.html," (CNN Business)A man is suing Burger King because the meatless Impossible Whopper is cooked on the same grill as meat products, the lawsuit alleges.The class action lawsuit, filed Monday in the Southern District of Florida, claims that although the burger chain advertises its vegan option as meat-free, it is contaminated by meat by-product because it's cooked on the same grill as meat products.The suit accuses Burger King of false advertising and benefiting monetarily from offering a vegan option that is not in fact vegan.Burger King declined to comment to several media outlets. CNN's sister network HLN has reached out to Burger King for a response to the allegations in the lawsuit but has not yet heard back.Burger King's website describes the Impossible Whopper as ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef.""""For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request,"" the site notes.Phillip Williams, the plaintiff in the case, is a vegan who does not eat or drink anything that uses animal by-products.He purchased an Impossible Whopper at a location in Atlanta in August after seeing advertisements and paid ""premium price"" for the meatless option, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit alleges that if he had known the burger would be cooked in such a manner, he would have not purchased it.The Burger King that Williams visited did not have signage at the drive-thru indicating that the plant-based burger would be cooked on the same grill as meat, the suit says. Williams ""suffered monetary damages in the amount that he paid to purchase"" the Impossible Whopper, according to the suit.The lawsuit indicates that several other consumers have made similar complaints online about the chain's practice surrounding the sale of the Impossible Whopper.The Impossible Whopper has been deemed a huge success for Burger King, fueling its best quarter in four years, according to Restaurant Bands (QSR)."
The world's first 3D-printed neighborhood is being built,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/business/worlds-first-3d-printed-neighborhood-trnd/index.html,"The houses aren't just a prototype. Developers hope to build 50 new houses by the end of 2020, replacing the structures that residents built themselves out of wood, metal and whatever materials they could afford.The families live in a seismic zone that's prone to flooding in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. Building something that will withstand an earthquake and keep them dry during heavy rains was a key consideration when it came to the design.""These families are the most vulnerable, and in the lowest income ... and they're living on about an average of $3 a day,"" said Brett Hagler, CEO and co-founder of New Story, the nonprofit building the community. ""They're living in literally a pieced-together shack that during the rainy season, it will rain and it will flood their shack. Some of the women even said that the water will go up to their knees when it rains, sometimes for months,"" Hagler told CNN on Wednesday.New Story is a nonprofit that helps families in need of shelter. It has built more than 2,700 homes in South America and Mexico since it was founded in 2014. This is the first homebuilding project it's done with 3D printing.The nonprofit paired up with ICON, a construction technology company that developed the 3D-printing robotics being used on the project. Ã‰CHALE, a nonprofit in Mexico, is helping find local families to live in the homes.The homes were co-designed with input from the families that will live in them.The 33-foot printer pipes out a concrete mix that hardens when it dries, building the walls one layer at a time. It takes 24 hours over several days to build two houses at the same time -- that's about two times faster than it takes New Story to build a home with regular construction. The concrete mix is sturdier than traditional concrete, New Story says. The foundation is reinforced to withstand seismic activity.The flat-roofed homes are reminiscent of a southwestern design, but with curved walls. The 500-square-foot homes have two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room and a kitchen. People haven't moved into the new houses yet, New Story says, because it would be dangerous for them to live in a construction zone.There's no price tag on the homes yet, but New Story says it's working with families to have them pay 20-to-30% of their income. They want people to have a sense of ownership in the community.Meet Vulcan II, the printerThe printer is named Vulcan II and it was made by ICON, an Austin-based construction technology company. It took three years of prototyping to get a printer capable of this project, the company said.While Vulcan II is building two 500-square-foot houses at the same time, it's capable of building a 2,000-square-foot house, according to ICON. The printer can build walls almost 9 feet high and 28 feet wide.The speed of homebuilding with the printer has gotten quicker. In March 2018, New Story and ICON revealed a three-bedroom home, which took 48 hours to build.""It's 10 times better than we were a year ago. I am so proud,"" ICON CEO and co-founder Jason Ballard told CNN on Wednesday. ""It is so rare that the-most-in-need of our sisters and brothers globally get first access to advanced technologies and breakthroughs in materials science.""Because 3D printing is cheaper and faster than traditional construction, there's great potential for how it will change the world, he said.""We think part of what 3D printing allows us to do is to deliver a much higher-quality product to the housing market at a speed and price that's typically not available for people in"" low-income housing, Ballard said. ""It is a house that anyone would be proud to live in.""Taking a printer out of the lab and putting it in the real world was an experiment in itself. Getting Vulcan II to the construction site and dealing with harsh weather conditions has been the biggest challenge so far, he said.The massive printer was transported in a standard shipping container. Border authorities had a lot of questions when they saw it, New Story said.It arrived at the peak of summer, right as the rainy season was beginning, Ballard said. The machinery and the staff faced floods, muddy roads and high humidity as they settled in. The logistical challenges made him realize how much we take for granted in America.The technnology holds promise for affordable housing""When you're doing anything for the first time ever ... and we're doing a challenging place, there's no blueprint or roadmap or set of instructions, so you're creating all of that as we go,"" Alexandria Lafci, New Story COO and co-founder, told CNN.The nonprofit staff believes in the promise of what the technology could mean for people who don't have safe shelter. Hagler said safe shelter is ""one of the largest crises affecting humanity today.""About 1.6 billion people in the world don't have adequate housing, according to a 2015 Habitat for Humanity study.""We seem to just accept that there will always be homelessness or there will always be people who don't have any access to education or water,"" Lafci said. ""We have some of the brightest minds and we have the most promising technology in Silicon Valley working on elite problems. How can we rethink and reshape existing and budding technology toward these more pressing issues?"" she said. The technology is there and the application to building homes for those in need brings a lot of hope for the future.""3D printing is not science fiction. We have crossed that threshold from science fiction into reality,"" Ballard said. ""In the future, our bet is that this will be humanity's best hope for a housing solution that that matches our highest values and ideals."""
America's largest grocer is revamping its produce section,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/business/walmart-groceries-kroger-aldi/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Produce is the first thing customers see when they enter Walmart and a key part of the retailer's defense against Amazon. So Walmart is giving its produce aisles a makeover.The largest grocer in the United States announced Wednesday that it will renovate produce areas with new signs highlighting prices and shorter merchandise bins to create an ""open market feel"" for customers. Walmart will also move all of its organic items into a single area of the department to make them easier to find. And it will widen the aisles to try to keep them from clogging up with customers and employees who pick up online grocery orders.Online grocery shopping has ""fundamentally changed the way we operate our food business within the store,"" said Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Walmart's US business. ""We've always got associates in the produce area. This layout created more space in the department to allow room for customers to shop.""The revamp, which Walmart has dubbed ""Produce 2.0,"" has already started at more than 200 stores. Walmart expects to complete it at the majority of its 4,700 US stores by next summer.Produce is an important category for grocers because 95% of shoppers prefer to buy it in store. And that number is growing. Produce sales grew 2.6% last year, according to a Nielsen study published earlier this year. ""Fresh is key to the food shopping experience,"" said Redfield. Walmart hopes a new merchandising look will help convince shoppers that it offers high-quality fruit and vegetables.""It plays to big, overarching consumer trends in health and wellness,"" said Jon Springer, executive editor of Winsight Grocery Business, an industry trade publication. Walmart's rivals have also invested in produce. German discount grocer Aldi expanded its produce and organic offerings in recent years, while Kroger's new slogan and advertisements, ""Fresh for Everyone,"" emphasize its focus on fresh food.On Tuesday, Kroger said it will begin growing some produce in hydroponic farms at its QFC stores in Washington state.America's largest grocerWalmart's latest initiative in produce is another attempt to bolster its 31-year-old grocery business.Walmart began selling groceries in 1988, when it opened its first superstore. Since then, groceries have become Walmart's largest sales driver, accounting for 56% of the company's more than $500 billion in revenue. Walmart is America's largest grocer and controls around 20% of the fragmented US grocery industry, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. The company has lowered prices on produce in recent years to compete with discount rivals and taken steps to speed up its supply chain. That has extended the time that fruits and vegetables last on the shelves.""One thing the customers were telling us is that, you know what, 'We didn't believe in your quality.' We knew we had some work to do there,"" Redfield said. Walmart has also poured investments into online grocery shopping to defend against Amazon, which bought Whole Foods in 2017 and plans to open a new grocery store next year in Los Angeles as an alternative to Whole Foods.Walmart added buy-online, pickup-in-store to around 3,000 locations and home delivery from more than 1,400 locations. The company recently launched a $98-a-year grocery delivery subscription.During Walmart's most recent quarter, online sales grew 41%, bolstered by grocery pickups and deliveries.""Fresh has become an important part of that online grocery basket,"" Redfield said."
Could this be the last holiday shopping season for Sears?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/business/sears-holiday-season/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Could this be the last holiday shopping season for Sears?The company narrowly survived its bruising bankruptcy fight just one year ago. Then creditors were in court clamoring for the iconic retailer to be closed down and its remaining assets liquidated.But in February US Bankruptcy Court Robert Drain gave the company a new lease on life, allowing its former CEO Eddie Lampert, to buy the remaining valuable assets out of bankruptcy, leaving behind the debt and leases he didn't want. Lampert vowed he had a plan to turn around the company's two brands, Sears and Kmart. He promised it would find an expert in retail rescues to lead the company as its new CEO.Ten months later, things have not gone as promised. There's no new CEO. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy with 425 stores, will soon have less than half of those stores still open. Rather than holiday sales this year, it started going-out-of-business sales at 96 of its remaining stores the week after Thanksgiving. This suggests that sales and turnaround plans have not lived up to expectations. As a privately held company, Sears no longer discloses its sales figures. It did say it recently lined up another $250 million in financing. But it won't comment on how the holiday shopping season has gone so far, or its financial prospects going forward.These struggles come at a time when consumer spending is strong, with unemployment at a 50-year low. Tariffs that the Trump administration is threatening to levy on many the imported consumer goods coming from China haven't taken effect yet. There's a good chance for Sears and other retailers, things will only get more difficult from here.""If you're going to be successful, now is the time to make that pivot,"" said Greg Portell, head of the retail practice at consultant AT Kearney, speaking about Sears' turnaround efforts.But Portell said that Sears was always going to have trouble attracting the buyers it needed, especially if it simply was trying to run an incrementally more profitable version of the company that failed once before.""They're not going to attract new shoppers at this point. But can they convince the core consumers they know best to shop there, there might be a path forward for them. But it's difficult,"" he said.So could Sears be heading back to a second bankruptcy filing? If it does, there's a good chance this one could be fatal. The retail sector is full of stories of companies that emerge from bankruptcy, try to make a go of it, then file for a second bankruptcy in short order, leading to closure and liquidation. In recent years Payless Shoes, Gymboree, American Apparel and RadioShack have all followed that path."
How data is taming South Africa's infamous taxibuses,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/business/data-south-africa-taxibuses/index.html,"Minibus taxis, which run without a specified route or schedule, accounted for nearly 70% of all public transport trips in the country in 2013, according to the most recent National Household Travel Survey.But their casual nature means safety and labor standards are unregulated.This is why Justin Coetzee set up GoMetro, a startup using big data to help authorities begin to monitor informal public transport in South Africa.  GoMetro mapped the transportation network in Cape Town by profiling each taxi route in the city, tracking things like route distance, number of stops and when passengers get on and off. The company collated this data and created a model of the network, looking at how to manage and optimize the network more efficiently. Then they deployed monitoring devices to make sure network operators stuck to the new plan. ""There's an enormous amount of inefficiencies as to how these routes have sprung up,"" Coetzee tells CNN Business. ""Our data is able to consolidate them into a much more rational plan for the entire city to work better.""He says their analysis improves service efficiency by between 30% and 50%, prompting changes in time schedules or the introduction of bigger vehicles on busy routes.The operation has also improved safety, says taxibus manager Nazeem Abdurahman. The tracker systems make drivers behave more professionally, and he believes they will help prevent robberies on board. Global attractionBut the benefits of GoMetro go beyond improving informal transport in developing countries. It has caught the attention of public transport services globally, with the startup now mapping in the United Kingdom, United States, Argentina, India, Kenya and Mexico. Coetzee says the company was valued at $15 million in a 2018 fundraising round.  In the United Kingdom, public transport firm Ascendal Group partnered with GoMetro to improve the efficiency of their subsidiary Whippet Coaches, which runs rural bus services in Cambridgeshire, England. ""What GoMetro did was build a really sophisticated suite of tools and methodologies to go and collect the data,"" Tom Williams, director of technology and innovation for Ascendal Group, tells CNN Business. This data can be leveraged in real time to ensure optimum schedules, fleet sizes and routes. ""It's not a high margin industry,"" he adds. ""You don't make much money running buses, so you have to be more intelligent with how you plan your systems."" The bigger impactTao Cheng, professor of Geoinformatics at University College London, believes that optimizing public transport is vital for urban development. ""Transport has a tremendous impact on city life and on the whole city's development,"" she says, citing how, in London, the price of property changes depending on the underground lines.According to Nationwide's House Price Index, Londoners pay a Â£42,900 ($55,232) premium to live within 500 meters from a station. Cheng has worked closely with Transport for London using Wi-Fi and Oyster card data (London's contactless payment cards) to analyze how they could improve the layout or the connection of the underground network. For instance, by using Oyster card data they were able to see which demographic groups were benefiting from the 24-hour weekend service on some underground lines, while Wi-Fi data enabled them to understand how people transfer between routes. This helped to inform their decision on which line to open next. ""You know your demand and you know the movement. Based on that you can design your system much more efficiently and effectively,"" Cheng says.When Transport for London first tested their Wi-Fi data collection system in 2016, it was met with concerns over whether data could be kept confidential.  For the 2019 rollout, Transport for London said that all data collected is automatically depersonalized and that it would not match Wi-Fi connection data to other data held about individuals, such as contactless data. It added that passengers are able to opt out by turning off their Wi-Fi when traveling. Similarly, GoMetro follows strict privacy protocols and anonymizes all personal data, says Coetzee. Advocates tout the benefits of the data collection. More efficient networks will use less fuel, reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. Coetzee believes it will also help to bring down the number of cars on the road. ""We're running out of space. We cannot continue in the car-dominated way that we have built cities since the 1950s,"" he says. ""We need to invest in public transport as a society, we need good public transport to have strong cities."""
This airline is opening a restaurant that only serves plane food,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/business/airasia-new-restaurant/index.html,"New York (CNN Business)Out of the many repulsive things about air travel, airline food probably ranks high. But not for AirAsia.Asia's largest low-cost carrier is betting people love its food so much that it opened its first restaurant on Monday, offering the same menu it sells on flights. It's not a gimmick, either: AirAsia, based in Malaysia, said it plans to open more than 100 restaurants globally within the next five years. The quick-service restaurant's first location is in a mall in Kuala Lumpur. It's called Santan, meaning coconut milk in Malay, which is the same branding AirAsia uses on its in-flight menus. Entrees cost around $3 USD and include local delicacies such as chicken rice and the airline's signature Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak dish, a rice dish with chilli sauce. Locally sourced coffee, teas and desserts are also on the menu. ""We have seen a significant appetite for our in-flight menu offerings beyond our flights across the region and this is our answer to that demand,"" the brand's general manager Catherine Goh said in a press release.AirAsia hopes its Asian-specific food will attract people over its western competitors. It's also part of the company's broader plan to become a lifestyle brand, according to a recent interview CEO Tony Fernandes gave to Nikkei. Malaysia and neighboring southeastern Asian countries are increasingly attracting American restaurants. Domino's Pizza (DMPZF) plans to have 300 locations in Mayalsia by next year, KFC has 700 restaurants and growing and McDonald's (MCD) recently announced a $300 million investment in the region to grow to more than 400 restaurants. AirAsia is also the first airline to bring its in-house food offerings to the ground. Typically, airlines attract high-end chefs from restaurants to craft in-flight menus. For example, JetBlue (JBLU) partnered with New York-based Saxon and Parole for its meals, and British Airways offers items for sale on some of its flights from regional retailer Marks and Spencer.
