""Danielle Horton not only knew of her son's whereabouts while he was on escape status, but assisted in getting him food and other items,"" when she was with his sister and cousin, police said. Anderson also helped the escaped inmate gain access to the Internet, police said, while Hawkins  allowed Howse to sleep in her home and assisted his mom in getting food.Hawkins, Horton, Anderson and Jasmine Howse have all been released and are due in court January 24, according to arrest warrant affidavits and the Davidson County Jail.It's not clear if Horton, Anderson and Jasmine Howse have attorneys.

Gardner and Alexander are still on the Hoyas' roster.One woman was granted a temporary restraining order against LeBlanc and Alexander on November 14, online court records show. One of her housemates also requested a restraining order against Gardner. That request has yet to be heard in court.No criminal charges have been filed against any of the men, local police say, but investigations are continuing.In one police report, one woman says she confronted one of the players on Facetime about items she believes he had a hand in stealing, and he verbally threatened her by saying, ""If you tell anyone, we'll send people after you.""The second woman says in her complaint that Gardner sexually harassed and assaulted her in the home, court documents show. In a police report filed November 4, the two women told investigators that a PlayStation 4, a Nikon camera, a camera lens and a pair of Bape shoes were taken on September 16. When reached by phone Tuesday, LeBlanc told CNN, ""I've got nothing to talk about."" He said he did not have a lawyer. Gardner has not responded to a voicemail seeking comment, but he told the Washington Post on Monday, ""I've never done those things in my life.""Attempts to reach Alexander on Tuesday were not successful. Criminal investigation is underwayKristen Metzger, chief spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department said: ""This is currently an active investigation. No criminal charges have been made at this time.""Kadia Koroma, spokeswoman for the US Attorney's Office in Washington, said, ""It doesn't look like there are criminal charges at this time.""The university's athletic department said in a statement online that conduct violation allegations are investigated by the Office of Student Conduct.

Student and school resource officer injured in second high school shooting in Wisconsin this week,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-tuesday/index.html," (CNN)A Wisconsin school resource officer on Tuesday shot and wounded a student who stabbed him during an altercation, police said. It was the second shooting to take place in a high school in the state in two days.  The incident occurred shortly after 9 a.m. in the office of the school resource officer at Oshkosh West High School in Oshkosh -- about 90 miles northwest of Milwaukee, police said. At 9:12 a.m., police received a garbled radio transmission from the school resource officer, who requested assistance and an ambulance, according to Oshkosh police Chief Dean Smith. The first responding officer arrived two minutes later.  The 16-year-old student stabbed the officer with an ""edged weapon"" before being shot by the officer with a 9mm pistol, Smith said. Both the student and officer were being treated at a hospital for non-life threatening injuries, Smith said. Smith said investigators were looking into whether there were warnings about the incident on social media. ""We believe there was only one suspect involved ... and this incident was isolated to this encounter,"" he said. Earlier, police said in a Facebook post that an armed student confronted a school resource officer and both were injured and taken to local hospitals.The school was on lockdown and parents instructed to reunite with their children at Perry Tipler Middle School, police said.""Today's incident was a contained situation,"" said Vickie Cartwright, Oshkosh Area School District superintendent.""First and foremost, we are so grateful for the proactive safety measures in place throughout our district as well as our partnership with local and state law enforcement. Our students and staff followed our emergency protocols.""She said classes will be canceled on Wednesday and counselors made available. The high school has about 1,700 students. ""Today's tragic event shows that trained school resource officers can help save lives,"" Cartwright said.  The state's division of criminal investigation has taken over the investigation. Here's what happened Monday in WaukeshaOn Monday in Waukesha, an officer shot a 17-year-old student at a high school classroom, police said. The suspect, who police said pointed a handgun at officers, is in stable condition in the intensive care unit of a local hospital, Waukesha Police Chief Russell Jack told reporters. He could face multiple felony counts but had not been charged. No other injuries were reported.Police later learned the suspect was armed with two realistic-looking pellet guns, Waukesha Police Capt. Dan Baumann told reporters Tuesday. A search of the suspect's home revealed another pellet gun and narcotics in his bedroom, Baumann said.Baumann said the student was ""angry"" at another student and had pointed one of the weapons at his head. The incident at Waukesha South High School unfolded after a student reported a classmate with a handgun. That's when a school resource officer rushed to a classroom and began getting other students to safety, police said in a press release.Other officers responded and tried to start a dialogue with the suspect, Jack said. The suspect at one point pulled the gun and pointed it at the officers, Baumann said. Waukesha Police Sgt. Brady Esser, who had rushed to the classroom with the SRO, fired his weapon, striking the suspect in the leg and arm, the captain said. Esser is an 11-year veteran. Baumann praised the way students, staff and law enforcement responded. ""It is exactly why we train,"" he said. ""It is exactly why we continue to do what we do in training and preparation -- unfortunately -- for events like this.""Jack added, ""The SRO did a great job responding immediately to the information and was able to remove many students from harm's way. While that was happening, a different officer was forced to discharge his firearm based on the imminent threat the suspect posed."" School district Superintendent Todd Gray said Monday, ""This is a superintendent's worst nightmare."" A separate, unrelated incident at a different school in the same city saw a 15-year-old boy taken into custody after police found him with a replica firearm later at his home, according to a police press release. Police were called to Waukesha North High School around 1 p.m. Monday for reports of a student with a gun, the release said. After the school was placed on lockdown, an investigation found the student was no longer on school property. Police responded to the student's home and found a replica of a firearm, police said. SROs communicate with students, enforce lawsAn SRO is assigned to each of the two public high schools in the Oshkosh Area School District, according to the city website. The primary goal of the officers -- who are Oshkosh police officers -- is ""preventing juvenile delinquency through education and positive communication with students. SROs also respond to problems in their assigned schools and assist when unusual events occur at the elementary schools,"" the website said. SROs take part in appropriate classroom lessons on topics such as bullying, internet safety and laws involving dating and relationships. The National Association of School Resource Officers said there are between 14,000 and 20,000 SROs across the nation. The association recommends they receive at least 40 hours of specialized training in school policing. SROs typically are armed, though some jurisdictions prohibit them from carrying firearms on campus. ""A school resource officer is a commissioned, sworn law enforcement officer, not a 'security guard,'"" The association said.CNN's Kara Devlin and Amir Vera contributed to this report. "
One of the last survivors of the USS Arizona will be interred on the sunken warship,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/us/pearl-harbor-uss-arizona-lauren-bruner-trnd/index.html," (CNN)A World War II veteran who was the second-to-last man to escape the USS Arizona during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will be interred on the ship's wreckage on Saturday.Lauren Bruner, one of 334 crew members to survive the December 7, 1941 attack, died on September 10, 2019, just months before his 99th birthday. The interment ceremony will be livestreamed and is scheduled to take place at sunset at the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii. Divers will place the urn containing Bruner's ashes inside the well of the barbette on gun turret No. 4. The ceremony will include a rifle salute, flag presentation, and plaque presentation in honor of the veteran. A barbette is an armored structure protecting a gun turret on a warship.The memorial can only be reached by boat as was built above the submerged hull of the sunken battleship. The hull is a tomb for more than 900 sailors who remain within and serves as an artificial reef providing habitat for marine life.Only the remains of USS Arizona survivors can be interred on the sunken battleship. Pearl Harbor survivors can have their ashes scattered over the harbor.Bruner was on the sky control deck when the ship was struck by several bombs, igniting explosions which killed 1,177 Arizona crew members. He was one of a handful of sailors on deck to survive the catastrophic explosion when a bomb struck the Arizona's forward magazine.After the explosion, he swam across 70 feet of burning water to reach the repair ship USS Vestal. Bruner suffered burns on nearly 80 percent of his body and was wounded by Japanese gunfire.He recovered from his wounds and returned to sea, serving aboard the destroyer USS Coghlan in eight more battles against the Japanese, according to the Navy. He finished the war as a fire control chief on Coghlan, steaming into Nagasaki harbor only days after the atomic bomb explosion. Bruner is the 44th and last USS Arizona survivor to be interred, according to Emily Pruett, a spokeswoman for the Pearl Harbor National Memorial.""The wrecks of only two vessels remain in the harbor — the Arizona and USS Utah — so survivors of those ships are the only ones who have the option to be laid to rest this way,"" Pruett told CNN.The rest of the ships which were struck that day were either repaired or scrapped, she said.The last three living survivors of the USS Arizona plan to be laid to rest with their families."
"Man pleads guilty in $400,000 GoFundMe scam",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/us/gofundme-scam-sentence-damico/index.html," (CNN)A man who was the instigator behind a false feel-good story that raised more than $400,000 as part of a GoFundMe scam plead guilty Friday in New Jersey court, according to prosecutors.Mark D'Amico, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree misapplication of entrusted property in Burlington County. ""We are pleased that this defendant accepted responsibility for his role in this scam,"" Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said in a statement. ""He will be required to make full restitution to GoFundMe and the donors — the true victims in this case — and has agreed to a five-year term in New Jersey state prison.""He will be officially sentenced in April.The charge stemmed from a viral 2017 story in which D'Amico's accomplice, Katelyn McClure, 29, supposedly ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. A homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas. McClure and D'Amico, her then-boyfriend, posted about the ""good deed"" on social media and started a GoFundMe to raise money for him. But the story was not true and unraveled after more than $400,000 had been contributed by more than 14,000 people through GoFundMe.Prosecutors said the then-couple spent the money on a BMW, a New Year's trip to Las Vegas, gambling in casinos, Louis Vuitton handbags and other items.Bobbitt, who had been given $75,000, according to prosecutors, took civil action against D'Amico and McClure and the scam soon became public.Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception and was put in a drug treatment program. If he fails to complete the program, he could be sentenced to five years in prison, according to prosecutors.McClure pleaded guilty in April to second-degree theft by deception in a plea agreement. She agreed to a four-year prison term but has not been sentenced, prosecutors said.Like D'Amico, both McClure and Bobbitt agreed to make restitution as part of their plea agreements.CNN's Eric Levenson and Laura Ly contributed to this report.

"Man rescued after shouting, 'Siri, call 911'",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/us/winnebago-river-man-car-crash-trnd/index.html," (CNN)""Siri, call 911.""  That's what a man in Charles City, Iowa yelled after his car plunged into an icy river. Gael Salcedo, 18, was on his way to North Iowa Area Community College when his Jeep hit a patch of ice on the road, according to CNN affiliate KIMT. Salcedo lost control of his car -- he turned to the right and from there, everything went blurry, he said. His car, though, plummeted into the Winnebago River.""I didn't know where I was going and then I just didn't know what to do. I was just thinking in my head 'I think I'm going to die,'"" he told KIMT.Salcedo rolled the windows down, worried that his car would sink. The ice and water surrounding him were below freezing temperatures, according to KIMT.He couldn't find his phone, so he did the next big thing: He used Siri. Officials with the Mason City Fire Department arrived at the scene quickly, but the river current immobilized the driver's side door shut.There were no other options -- Salcedo had to walk out, Lt. Craig Warner with the Mason City Fire Department told KIMT. ""My hands were freezing. I couldn't feel my legs anymore, so I was struggling a lot and the water was just so strong,"" Salcedo told KIMT.  ""I kept tripping, and I had the guy help me up a bunch of times and I used all my strength to get out of the water.""With Warner's help, Salcedo made it out of the river and into the ambulance. He was treated for shock and released from the hospital just a few hours later, according to KIMT."

Girlfriend of teen escapee arrested by Nashville police,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/nashville-teen-escapees-girlfriend-arrested/index.html," (CNN)The 15-year-old girlfriend of a boy who escaped with three other teens from a Tennessee  juvenile detention center has been arrested on suspicion of being an accessory after the fact of escape.Her boyfriend, Decorrius Wright, 16, and 15-year-old Calvin Howse were recaptured Tuesday night.Nashville police said the girl is accused of criminal responsibility for facilitation of a felony, accessory after the fact of escape, harboring, tampering with evidence and lying to police.Police said she ""aided Wright's ability to remain at large between the time of Saturday night's escape from the Juvenile Justice Center and Wright's apprehension Tuesday night in Madison."" Authorities are still searching for two other teens who escaped. One who remains at large has been added to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list. Brandon Caruthers, 17, is being charged as an adult in an armed robbery case from August last year, police said. ""He should be considered dangerous,"" a TBI flyer said.A reward up to $2,500 is being offered for information leading to his arrest, according to the bureau. Teens escaped through the front doorsThe arrests come hours after officials released security videos that showed the teens running undetected through the empty hallways of the facility and escaping through the front door.The videos released  by the Davidson County Juvenile Court show the teens -- Wright, Howse, Morris Marsh and Caruthers --  as they make their way outside the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center in downtown Nashville. Three were shown wearing bright yellow vests.The teens escaped the facility past the 9 p.m. usual bedtime when a staff supervisor left them cleaning an area inside the facility by themselves and went to a different floor to address a disturbance, the company managing the center said. They entered an elevator that had been left open by a staff member, according to a statement from Davidson County Juvenile Court. They were ""able to convince a staff member to make a call to Master Control and request that the elevator be sent to the basement, which is an unsecured area youth are not permitted to access.""The footage appears to begin moments after they exited an elevator that connects the secured area of the facility to a public area in the basement. The teens are seen racing up the stairs to the main level of the facility. One of them briefly ran down the hallway away from the stairs before turning around to follow the others. The group, still wearing their vests, continues running on empty hallways before they go through the glass front doors and down the front steps of the building. Video from a camera outside the building shows one of them taking off his yellow vest and tossing it near the front entrance.Authorities had said it was more than likely the teens had some assistance once they were outside but no one else other than the teens appears on the surveillance footage.Youth Opportunity Investments, a private detention contractor which has managed the center since 2015, has fired three employees and suspended one for three days in reaction to the escape, the company said.Two are accused in murder casesTwo of the teens were accused of murder in separate cases earlier this year.Wright  is accused in the February death of Kyle Yorlets, police said.

A New York high school has canceled its 'Tarzan' musical production after racism complaints,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/new-york-high-school-tarzan-racism-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN)A high school in Elmsford, New York, has canceled its spring musical production of ""Disney's Tarzan"" after school community members complained about the racial undertones.Students had reacted with ""delight"" when Alexander Hamilton High School's drama club announced the Tarzan musical, according to a news release from the school district.But plans changed after ""further consideration of the source material, upon which the story was derived,"" the district said.""Some members of our school community had expressed concerns over the racial undertones of the source material, and the district agreed to reconsider the choice,"" it said.""Tarzan of the Apes,"" a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, was published in 1912. The story of Tarzan follows the journey of young orphan boy who grows up in an African jungle and is raised by apes, struggling to survive in a savage African world.The novel and its film adaptations have been criticized for their racist depiction of colonialism, imperialism and African natives.Parents were concerned that students of color would play ape characters, according to the Journal News newspaper.""We have shared with students and parents how important it is that all their voices be heard,"" Elmsford Union Free School District Superintendent Marc Baiocco said.

"Mold at Florida military housing caused mushrooms to grow out of carpets, lawsuit says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/macdill-air-force-base-housing-florida-lawsuit/index.html," (CNN)Mold in privately run housing at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida not only caused health problems but led to mushrooms growing out of a floor and carpet, according to a federal lawsuit filed by five service members and their families.The lawsuit, filed this week in US District Court in Tampa, accuses the housing owners and managers of ignoring repeated complaints about mold exposure, conducting inadequate remediation work and not sharing mold test results with the military families.""In at least one instance, moldy conditions went untreated ... for so long that mushrooms grew out of the floor and carpet,"" the suit said. ""Indeed, once a leak, flood, or dampness occurs, mold can begin to spread, and its natural progression is to spur highly toxic 'mold mushrooms' that are harmful to human and animals alike,"" according to the lawsuit. The defendants in the case -- the Michaels Organization, Michael Management Services, Interstate Realty Management Company, AMC East Communities, Clark Realty Capital and Harbor Bay at MacDill -- did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The serious mold problems at the housing complex, known as Harbor Bay at MacDill, were known to the defendants since 2016, the suit said. The service members and their families suffered numerous health problems from exposure to the mold, including respiratory ailments, liver and spleen damage, headaches, memory loss, rashes, arthritis and lupus, the suit said.  The families were forced to vacate their homes and move to temporary housing for extended periods of time, according to the suit. The suit said US Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson visited the base in March to hear residents' complaints about mold and other problems. In June, the Air Force sent a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency to speak with the families. After remediation efforts, the defendants often failed to share the results of mold and moisture inspections with families, the suit said.  ""These men and women who serve our country and keep us safe, and their children safe, deserve to life in safe, clean, and uncontaminated housing,"" the suit said. In May, a report by the Military Family Advisory Network, a charitable organization, said that 54% of 105 service members surveyed at MacDill had experienced problems with mold, according to the suit. The Air Force this year cut money the defendants received through a performance incentive fee because of mold problems and complaints about remediation efforts, the suit said.    Service chiefs from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March. They acknowledged widespread problems with the handling of military housing and pledged to address a range of issues.   At an earlier Senate hearing, the committee heard testimony from military families who detailed the poor condition of some privatized housing units on bases across the country, including issues with mold, lead paint and rats.The four US military services said they had prepared a draft of a joint ""Tenant Bill of Rights"" as a first step at increasing the quality of service member housing. But it remained unclear how the services plan to hold private housing contractors accountable for issues related to poor construction or potential negligence.CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report."

During Ryan's Monday appearance on KNBR, a Bay Area radio station, he said Jackson's skin color helped him disguise a dark football when running fake handoffs during a recent game.""He's really good at that fake, Lamar Jackson, but when you consider his dark skin color with a dark football with a dark uniform, you could not see that thing. I mean you literally could not see when he was in and out of the mesh point."" Ryan and the team apologized for the remarks on Wednesday.""I regret my choice of words in trying to describe the conditions of the game,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""Lamar Jackson is an MVP-caliber player and I respect him greatly. I want to sincerely apologize to him and anyone else I offended."" The 49ers added in a statement, ""we are disappointed in Tim Ryan's comments earlier this week and have suspended him for the upcoming game. We hold Tim to a high standard as a representative of our organization and he must be more thoughtful with his words."" ""Tim has expressed remorse in a public statement and has also done so with us privately. We know Tim as a man of high integrity and are confident he will grow and learn from this experience.""""We have reached out to the Baltimore Ravens organization to extend our apologies and assure them the matter is not being taken lightly.""The Ravens defeated the 49ers 20-17 in Baltimore this past Sunday.

George Zimmerman sues Trayvon Martin's parents and others for $100 million,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/george-zimmerman-lawsuit-trayvon-martin-mother/index.html," (CNN)George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, but according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Florida, he believes there was a conspiracy to frame him and wants $100 million in damages.Attorney Larry Klayman announced the lawsuit in tandem with a Coral Gables screening of a documentary titled ""The Trayvon Martin Hoax,"" which has since been canceled. Zimmerman was scheduled to appear alongside Klayman at a Thursday news conference, but hours later, Klayman said the news conference was canceled, too.The chief allegation in the lawsuit is that civil rights attorney Ben Crump helped to swap out a reluctant witness, Brittany Diamond Eugene, for her half-sister, Rachel Jeantel, and helped prepare her to deliver a script intended to land Zimmerman in prison for the 17-year-old's killing on February 26, 2012. Crump began representing Trayvon's parents starting February 28, 2012, the lawsuit says.The suit accuses Trayvon's parents, prosecutors and state authorities of going along with the alleged ruse, and ""are alleged to either have known about or should have known about the witness fraud, obstructed justice, or lied repeatedly under oath in order to cover up their knowledge of the witness fraud,"" a news release from Klayman said.Klayman, who founded the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, has filed several lawsuits in the past, including a ""birther"" lawsuit that falsely claimed former President Barack Obama couldn't be president because he wasn't a natural-born citizen. According to Zimmerman's lawsuit, Jeantel posed as Trayvon's girlfriend when it was Eugene who was dating Trayvon and on the phone with him during the encounter with Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain. Jeantel then delivered bogus testimony on the stand at Zimmerman's trial, the lawsuit alleges. The alleged conspirators went along with the plot, despite Jeantel being two years older, 5 inches taller and about 120 pounds heavier than Eugene, the lawsuit says.The plan was made final in a 3-minute phone call between Crump and Eugene on March 31, 2012, the lawsuit says.  Jeantel's testimonyJeantel, a key prosecution witness, testified Trayvon told her in the phone call that someone was following him. As Trayvon neared the home of his father's girlfriend, he tried to lose Zimmerman, she testified. Jeantel said she heard him talking to Zimmerman in the background. ""He said, 'Why are you following me for?' And I heard a hard-breathing man say, 'What you doing around here?'"" Jeantel said. Jeantel testified she heard a bump from Trayvon's headset hitting something and ""wet grass sounds.""""I start hearing a little bit of Trayvon saying, 'Get off, get off!'"" said Jeantel.She admitted on the stand to lying several times to Trayvon's family about her age and about her reasons for not attending Trayvon's funeral. Jeantel found herself under the unforgiving light of a nationally televised trial. Viewers criticized her for her dress, her weight and speech and her combative manner on the stand. 'Unfounded and reckless lawsuit'Crump and Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, denied the allegations.""I have every confidence that this unfounded and reckless lawsuit will be revealed for what it is -- another failed attempt to defend the indefensible and a shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others,"" Crump said in a statement issued on his and Trayvon's parents' behalf.""This plaintiff continues to display a callous disregard for everyone but himself, revictimizing individuals whose lives were shattered by his own misguided actions. He would have us believe that he is the innocent victim of a deep conspiracy, despite the complete lack of any credible evidence to support his outlandish claims,"" the statement said.CNN is reaching out to others accused in the lawsuit. Jeantel did not immediately return a voicemail and text message seeking comment. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement declined to comment and so did Attorney General Ashley Moody, through a spokeswoman.The lawsuit alleges malicious prosecution, abuse of process, civil conspiracy and defamation.It seeks compensatory and actual damages of more than $100,000,000 and leaves open the possibility of an additional claim for punitive damages.A month after the February 2012 shooting, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said Zimmerman was not charged because there were no grounds to disprove his version of the events. Zimmerman said he shot Trayvon in self-defense.Weeks later, amid widespread outrage, a special prosecutor charged Zimmerman with murder.  A jury acquitted him of all charges in July 2013.Zimmerman's legal issuesZimmerman has been arrested in several alleged domestic incidents but not charged. In November 2013, he was arrested on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief accusations. But prosecutors said they wouldn't press charges after his girlfriend said she wanted the case dropped. Zimmerman was arrested in January 2015 on the suspected aggravated assault of another girlfriend. Prosecutors didn't press charges after the alleged victim backed off her claims.A year later, Zimmerman put the gun that killed Trayvon up for auction. The impact of Trayvon's deathTrayvon's death spurred a movement and helped give rise to the rallying cry that resonated with many: #BlackLivesMatter.The movement forced a conversation about police brutality and inequality.The image of Trayvon wearing a hoodie was iconic. Professional athletes wore hoodies, and protesters repeated the mantra: ""I am Trayvon Martin"" to express solidarity and outrage.Trayvon's death inspired President Obama to deliver a heartfelt message to saying, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.

"8-year-old Virginia girl was strip searched during a state prison visit, authorities say",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/us/virginia-minor-strip-search/index.html," (CNN)An 8-year-old girl visiting her father at a Virginia prison was strip searched last month in violation of state policy, authorities said.""The incident is deeply troubling and represents a breach in our protocol,"" said Lisa Kinney, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Corrections, in a statement to CNN. ""We sincerely apologize to this child and her family.""The child was visiting her father, who is an inmate at Buckingham Correctional Center, Kinney said. The girl was accompanied by an adult visitor who was not her parent or legal guardian.The staff member who ordered the search didn't have the authority to do so and is facing disciplinary action, Kinney said.The Virginia Department of Corrections would not confirm the relationship between the adult visitor and the child's incarcerated father, but The Washington Post reported the girl was accompanied by her father's girlfriend.The staff member requested the search because a drug-sniffing dog flagged the daughter and the adult accompanying her, which is department policy. Department of Corrections policy requires that a parent or legal guardian approve the strip search of minors. In this case, the unrelated adult visitor signed off, against policy, Kinney said.The Virginian-Pilot reported that the father's girlfriend was initially told that the daughter would not be strip searched but the decision was reversed after guards consulted with an officer. The newspaper also reported the girlfriend informed prison guard's that she was not the girl's mother or guardian.Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has temporarily suspended the strip search policy related to minors.""I am deeply disturbed by these reports -- not just as Governor, but as a pediatrician and a dad,"" Northam said in a statement. ""I've directed the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security to suspend this policy while the Department conducts an immediate investigation and review of their procedures.""Kinney said the state is only temporarily suspending the policy as it regards to minors, pending further review. ""Strip search policies for visitors to prisons are in place to keep offenders, visitors, and staff as safe as possible by reducing the contraband (e.g., drugs, cell phones, weapons) smuggled into the state's prisons. Strip searches are requested when a K-9 has alerted on a visitor. Visitors are always free to deny the strip search and leave the facility.""The ACLU of Virginia said that visitors who choose to deny the search can lose visiting privileges. ""If you deny that invasive search request, you're at risk of having your visiting privileges permanently or temporarily suspended,"" women's rights lawyer Nicole Tortoriello said. ""We think this is a very coercive policy.""Even if the visitor consents to the search and nothing is found, the mere fact that they were flagged for a search means they will not be allowed physical contact with the prisoner they're visiting that day, Tortoriello said.""Children should never in any circumstances be subjected to an invasive, humiliating, traumatizing strip or cavity search administered by strangers while attempting to visit a loved one in a correctional facility,"" Tortoriello said.The Virginia Department of Corrections had previously been under fire for proposing that visitors be banned from using tampons, menstrual pads, or other menstrual products. While the state suspended the proposed ban in 2018, the ACLU of Virginia sent letters to Buckingham Correctional Center and other jails, alleging that they had received complaints they were still detaining visitors who used menstrual products.CNN has not been able to identify the mother of the child. The girlfriend did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN."
Saudi nationals detained after fatal shooting at Pensacola naval base,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/us/pensacola-naval-station-shooting-saturday/index.html," (CNN)A number of Saudi nationals were detained after three people were shot dead and eight others injured at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, a US official confirmed to CNN on Saturday.The gunman, who was killed, was a second lieutenant in the Saudi Arabian military involved in flight training at the station, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Friday.  Officials are looking into whether the shooting was terror-related as a possible motive.The US official did not provide information about the status of the Saudis who were questioned.Two law enforcement sources earlier told CNN the shooter has been identified as Saudi Arabian national Mohammed Alshamrani.In a report citing tweets attributed to Alshamrani, the SITE intelligence group paints a picture of an individual with extreme anti-American views. SITE says Alshamrani quoted Osama Bin Laden in a ""will"" posted to Twitter. Additionally, SITE reports that postings from Alshamrani show a hatred toward Americans for what he perceived as a pro-Israel stance.CNN has not confirmed the Twitter account that SITE attributes to Alshamrani was his. Twitter tells CNN the account referenced in the report has been suspended but  did not confirm it belongs to Alshamrani or the reason for the suspension.The shooter started his training in Pensacola in August 2017 as part of a three-year program. He was taking classes in basic aviation, initial pilot training and English, according to a spokesperson for the assistant to the Secretary of Defense.Esper said Friday the Defense Department will review measures for screening foreign students.""I also talked about our team looking at the measures we have in place to ensure proper vetting and screening of foreign students as they come to our country to make sure we understand we have a good handle on who they are and that they've been properly screened,"" Esper said.FOLLOW LIVE UPDATESFamily members identified one of the victims as Joshua Kaleb Watson and praised him as a hero.""After being shot multiple times he made it outside and told the first response team where the shooter was and those details were invaluable,"" Adam Watson wrote about his brother on Facebook. ""He died a hero and we are beyond proud but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.""Authorities have not released victims' names or discussed what victims told them at the scene.Joshua Watson was from Enterprise, Alabama. In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WDHN, Mayor Bill Cooper said, ""The Enterprise community suffered a tremendous blow Friday upon hearing of the death of one of our own, Joshua Watson...I am proud of him for his service and dedication to his country.""Saad bin Hantim Alshamrani, an uncle of the shooting suspect, told CNN from Saudi Arabia that his nephew had done ""nothing suspicious"" before moving to the US.He said his nephew was 21 and ""likable and mannered towards his family and the community."" He added that his nephew ""has his religion, his prayer, his  honesty and commitments"" and that he was a ""likable kid, smart, he was exceptionally smart.""The elder Alshamrani said his country needs to ""get to the truth"" and that if his nephew was guilty, then he will be ""accountable before God."" Foreign students have long trained at the baseNaval Air Station Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. Many families also live there, said retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, CNN's military and diplomatic analyst, who was once stationed there.Foreign students from ""partner nations"" have trained at the base to learn naval aviation for years, Commanding Officer of NAS Pensacola Capt. Tim Kinsella told reporters. ""There's always been international students training here because it's a good place to train, it's good quality training,"" he said. He roughly estimated that there were a couple hundred foreign students at the base.At a news conference, Gov. Ron DeSantis mentioned the connection to the Saudi Air Force and said that he had spoken to President Donald Trump about it.  ""There's obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi Air Force and then to be here training on our soil,"" he said. ""Obviously,"" DeSantis added, ""the government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims.""Saudi King Salman Abdulaziz Al-Saud expressed ""deep sadness and sorrow"" in the call, state-run SPA news reported. The king told the President that he ordered Saudi services to cooperate with the investigation, according to SPA.Trump said on Twitter he has spoken with the King of Saudi Arabia about the shooting. ""The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people,"" the president said.Asked whether the shooting would affect the US-Saudi military-to-military relationship, Esper said, ""I don't see this undermining the deeper relationship we've had with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for decades.""Two deputies were wounded in confrontationAuthorities first received a call about an active shooter at NAS Pensacola around 6:51 a.m. Friday, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told reporters. The shooting occurred in a classroom building, Kinsella said. The shooter used a handgun and was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him. The deputies who confronted the shooter also suffered gunshot wounds -- one in the arm and one in the knee. Both are expected to survive.Escambia County Chief Deputy Chip Simmons recalled ""the closer I got to NAS, the more gunshots I heard on the police radio.""Simmons spoke Saturday at a prayer vigil at Olive Baptist Church in Pensacola.He said he heard on the police radio, ""'How many rescue units do you think you need' and the response over the radio was, 'As many as you can bring,'"" Simmons said.Walking through the scene ""was like being on the set of a movie,"" Morgan said. ""This doesn't happen in Escambia County. It doesn't happen in Pensacola. It doesn't happen to our friends and neighbors who are members of the US Navy,"" Morgan said. ""But it did, and it has."" The shooting comes just two days after an active duty US sailor, Gabriel Romero, killed two civilian employees and injured another before killing himself at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Hawaii. Investigators have not announced a motive for the Wednesday shooting.The FBI is investigatingThe FBI has taken over the Pensacola investigation, according to an FBI spokeswoman. The investigation is global in scope, a law enforcement source told CNN, with agents posted in Riyadh tasked with liaising with the Saudi government to obtain background information about the shooter. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told CNN's Erin Burnett that the FBI had secured the areas on base where the shooter was staying and they had recovered his laptop and cell phone.In a tweet early Saturday morning, FBI Jacksonville offered a statement from Special Agent in Charge Rachel Rojas expressing condolences to the families of the victims of Friday's shooting. ""On behalf of the entire #FBI, I offer our condolences to the families of the innocent victims taken from us, and our support to the entire community. We live here with you, and you have my commitment that will give our all to this investigation,"" Rojas said.CNN's Melissa Alonso, Scottie Andrew, Josh Campbell, Rachel Clarke, Shimon Prokupecz, Alta Spells, Amanda Watts, Raja Razek, Taylor Barnes, Jay Croft and David Shortell contributed to this report."
Three men indicted for murder of key witness in trial of ex-cop who killed black man,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/amber-guyger-witness-murder/index.html," (CNN)Three men were indicted by a grand jury on capital murder charges Thursday for allegedly killing Joshua Brown, a key witness in the murder trial of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, according to court documents.Jacquerious Mitchell, Michael Mitchell and Thaddeous Green were indicted for the shooting death of Brown on October 4. The indictments say the three men attempted to rob him. Previously, Dallas Assistant Chief of Police Avery Moore said Brown was killed after an argument escalated with Green in the parking lot of Brown's apartment complex. Brown allegedly shot and wounded Jacquerious Mitchell, according to Moore. Green then shot Brown twice and took a backpack from Brown and the gun used to wound Mitchell.Brown's death came 10 days after he testified in the trial of Guyger, 31, who was convicted of murder for fatally shooting Botham Jean in his Dallas apartment in 2018. She argued that she mistakenly walked into the wrong apartment — she lived in the same building — and opened fire because she thought Jean was an intruder.Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison.Brown lived across the hall from Jean at Dallas' South Side Flats apartments last year when Guyger killed Jean. In court, he testified that he returned home to his fourth-floor apartment at nearly the same time Guyger walked into Jean's apartment, mistaking it for her own.Brown said he was down the hall when he heard the voices of two people who sounded like they were meeting by ""surprise."" Gunshots followed ""right after,"" Brown said.Soon after, Brown said, he saw Guyger leave Jean's apartment and enter the hallway. The officer was on the phone. She was ""crying, explaining what happened, what she thought happened, saying she came in to the wrong apartment,"" Brown testified.Brown had been shot beforeBrown had survived a shooting nearly a year before his death, his attorney Lee Merritt said.He was shot near a strip club in Dallas in November 2018, Merritt said. Nicholas Shaquan Diggs was killed in the shooting, Merritt told CNN. Both Brown and his family believed he was targeted in that shooting by someone he knew and had grown up with.""And he was concerned that that person might try to come back and finish the job,"" Merritt said, adding that the shooter in that case hasn't been arrested.Brown moved out of South Side Flats about three months after Jean was killed in September 2018, according to Merritt. He tried to keep a ""low profile intentionally until some of the heat from the shooting in November passed over,"" Merritt added.CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report."
The UPS hijacking ended in a hail of bullets in rush-hour traffic. Police now face questions about their response,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/us/florida-ups-truck-police-chase-investigation/index.html," (CNN)The scene was a nightmare: After a long, televised police chase of a hijacked UPS truck ground to a halt at a jammed South Florida intersection, gunfire erupted seemingly from everywhere Thursday evening — with vehicles stopped at a traffic light serving as officers' impromptu shields.Gunfire exploded toward and from the truck. A bystander crouched on a median, then scrambled away as officers closed in.In the end, four people were shot dead at the intersection in Miramar, authorities said, including two robbery suspects, a bystander, and hostage UPS driver Frank Ordonez, a man who relatives say had been substituting for a colleague who had called out from work that day.The slain robbers and hijackers were Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, both of Miami-Dade County, the FBI said. The bystander who was killed was Richard Steven Cutshaw, according to the Broward County, Florida, medical examiner's office.The union field representative was driving home from work when he was killed in the crossfire, said Don Slesnick, a lawyer for the Office and Professional Employees International Union where Cutshaw worked. Slesnick said Cutshaw represented more 2,500 government employees in Broward County and Naples, helping them with insurance benefits, assignments, pay issues and negotiating contracts.Known as ""Rick"" to his coworkers, Slesnick said he was good-humored and pleasant who was loved by all who worked with him.""He fought with a positive attitude,"" Slesnick said.The cause and manner of death of the four deceased were not released due to the active criminal investigation, the medical examiner said.Numerous questions about the chase and its finale remain, including who shot Ordonez and Cutshaw. Ordonez's stepfather said he can't understand why his stepson is dead.""For this to happen, I think, is just unnecessary,"" Joe Merino told NBC's ""Today"" show Friday morning. ""Other tactics should have been applied, and they weren't, so when I say the word devastated, it's an understatement.""A police union official, meanwhile, said that officers handled the situation well, given the circumstances.""If you shoot at us, we are going to engage. We are going to stop the threat,"" Steadman Stahl, president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, said Friday. ""When bad guys are shooting at you, how do you negotiate?""The chase began with a jewelry store robberyThe incident began with a jewelry store robbery late Thursday afternoon in Coral Gables, near Miami, authorities said.Police got a call about a silent holdup alarm at 4:17 p.m. from Regent Jewelers in Coral Gables, city Police Chief Edward J. Hudak Jr. said. At least one woman was hurt in the robbery, police said. The woman had surgery and was conscious Friday and ""doing well,"" Hudak said. Police Director Juan Perez said she suffered a wound to the head.The suspects then hijacked the UPS truck, took the driver hostage and sped away.Soon after, police received a call of gunshots -- believed to have been fired by the escaping suspects, Hudak said -- at Coral Gables City Hall, just within sight of the jeweler's shop. A bullet struck the building, which went into lockdown.A long chase on a highway and city streetsThe UPS truck then fled over at least 25 miles, through city streets and along an interstate. Police caught its trail, and some of their pursuit unfolded on local television as news helicopters captured the scenes from above.Police radioed that gunfire occasionally erupted from the truck — its back doors sometimes open — even as police chased it on or near I-75, CNN affiliate WSVN reported.The truck hopped curbs, spun U-turns and maneuvered around other vehicles and police. Emergency vehicles trailed the hijacked truck, stretching at one point for about half a mile.Then, as the truck approached the intersection of Miramar Parkway and Flamingo Road in Miramar around 5:35 p.m., the chase ground to a halt. Traffic — including a light-colored SUV and, behind it, a dark-colored SUV — was stopped, and the UPS truck suddenly was boxed in. More than 40 emergency vehicles, their lights flashing, queued up in its wake.Shots rang out as officers closed inPolice officers left their vehicles and approached the UPS truck, weapons drawn. They used cars — their own and those that had been at the intersection — as shields so they could approach in a better position.The person driving the UPS truck left the steering wheel.Shots rang out, though who fired first — someone inside the truck or police — remains an open question.Muzzle flashes could be seen inside the truck, helicopter footage from WSVN shows. Smoke began to rise. Gunfire exploded, seemingly from everywhere, a video recorded by someone in a car and posted to Twitter shows. A bystander in a median crouched, then scurried away as officers moved in all around, the video shows. Chaos gripped the scene. The light-colored SUV, behind which at least three officers had taken cover, rolled forward, putting a stationary white van between it and the UPS truck, video from WSVN shows.Then, the dark-colored SUV moved up, pushing into the lighter SUV's bumper. Officers took cover on the driver's side of that vehicle, WSVN video shows.No more than a minute after the shootout started, bedlam turned to quiet. The truck's windshield bore marks from numerous bullets.13 officers were shot at, union chief saysAt least 13 police officers were shot at, but none was injured, said Stahl, the police union president.Two or three bullets pierced the windshield of one officer's cruiser, Stahl said.Whether the UPS driver and the slain bystander were shot by police is under investigation, FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also is investigating, Hudak said.""This is what dangerous people do to get away,"" Hudak, the Coral Gables police chief, told reporters Thursday.

Kosher market attack is being investigated as domestic terrorism,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/jersey-city-new-jersey-shooting-thursday/index.html," (CNN)This week's deadly kosher market attack and the killing of a detective in New Jersey are being investigated as acts of domestic terrorism ""fueled by both anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs,"" the state attorney general said Thursday.""We believe the suspects held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people, as well as a hatred of law enforcement,"" New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said, citing evidence and witness interviews.Investigators believe David N. Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, killed a police detective near a Jersey City cemetery and then stormed a nearby Jewish market Tuesday, shooting and killing three people there and starting an hourslong police standoff that ended with their deaths, authorities said.It's still not know why Anderson and Graham attacked the detective and the JC Kosher Supermarket in particular, Grewal said.But evidence points to these being ""acts of hate,"" Grewal said in a news conference in Jersey City. The FBI is investigating the shootings as ""domestic terrorism with a hate-crime bias slant to it,"" said Gregory Ehrie, special agent in charge for the FBI in Newark.Investigators think Anderson and Graham acted by themselves, Ehrie said.While both shooters have expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, neither appear to have established formal links to the movement, Grewal said. Grewal didn't specify evidence pointing to a hate crime, though he said social media accounts believed linked to the shooters ""espouse certain viewpoints."" Grewal and others stressed that once at the market, the shooters apparently fired only at people there, and at responding police officers, bypassing multiple opportunities to shoot others on the street.""They were clearly targeting that store. They were clearly targeting the Jersey City Police Department,"" US Attorney Craig Carpenito said, partly citing surveillance video.Investigators are checking killers' ties to a previous killing and anti-Semitic writingsAnderson and Graham also were suspects in the weekend killing of a livery driver near the neighboring New Jersey city of Bayonne, Grewal has said. That man died Saturday, local media outlets, including NJ.com, reported.Authorities haven't said what, if anything, links the weekend killing to Tuesday's shootings, other than investigators believe Anderson and Graham were behind them all.Investigators also checking a note found a stolen U-Haul truck that the killers parked across from the market -- a note that contained both anti-Semitic and anti-police writing, a law enforcement source told CNN.Posts with similar sentiments also have been found on social media linked to the shooters, the source said.""Our community has been terrorized once again by violent anti-Semitism,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. ""From Pittsburgh to Poway, and now to Jersey City, the disease that is anti-Semitism has clearly spread to epidemic proportions.""""But we will not be defeated, we will not stand down, we will not be intimidated,"" Greenblatt said. Shooters had lots of firepower and 'could have done more' had police not stopped themKilled Tuesday were Jersey City police Detective Joseph Seals and three people in the market: Mindy Ferencz, 31, the store's co-owner; Moshe Deutsch, 24, a customer; and Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, a store employee.One person who was inside the market was shot when Anderson and Graham opened fire, but he fled the store as the attackers shot at him, and survived, officials said.Investigators think all three slain victims in the store ""were shot ... within minutes of the shooters entering the store,"" Grewal said.Hundreds of ammunition shells have been recovered from the market scene, Grewal said.Grewal on Thursday gave this account of the attackers' weapons found in the store:• An AR-15-style weapon, which Anderson fired as he entered• A Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Graham carried into the store• A 9mm Ruger semiautomatic firearm• A 9mm Glock 17Inside the killers' stolen U-Haul across the street was a pipe bomb and a fifth gun -- a .22-caliber Ruger with a homemade silencer and a homemade device to catch shells, Grewal said.The U-Haul also had ""ballistic panels"" designed to resist damage, Grewal said.""But for the actions of (police), they (the attackers) could have done more,"" Grewal said.Graham bought the shotgun and the Ruger in Ohio in the spring of 2018, the attorney general said.Tracking the shooters from a cemetery to the marketBefore Anderson and Graham made their way to the kosher market, they are believed to have killed Seals near a city cemetery, authorities have said. Police have said Seals was trying to stop Anderson and Graham -- but they haven't said why he tried, or why Anderson and Graham killed him.A bystander called 911 to report Seals' body at the cemetery at 12:38 p.m., authorities said.By that time, Anderson and Graham already were attacking the market.Surveillance video shows Anderson parking a stolen U-Haul across the street from the JC Kosher Supermarket, about a mile from the cemetery, city officials say.The pair get out, and a man -- Anderson, police say -- walks directly toward the store, apparently ignoring several people on the sidewalk nearby, and starts firing a gun into it before entering. Graham follows, police say.Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop has cited this video -- appearing to show Anderson ignoring pedestrians and other businesses -- as evidence that he attacked the kosher store for specific reasons.""My sentiment is that it should be viewed as a hate crime,"" Fulop said Wednesday afternoon. ""There's no question it was an attack on the Jewish community.""Police arrived at the supermarket around 20 minutes after the attack began, starting a long shootout that left two police officers injured. Around 3:25 p.m., a police armored vehicle broke into the supermarket's entryway, and law enforcement soon found the bodies of the three victims and two attackers inside the store, Grewal said.Investigators checking shooter's connection to Black Hebrew Israelites and anti-Semitic notesA law enforcement official told the New York Times Wednesday that Anderson appears to have a connection with the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, but the extent is unclear.The Black Hebrew Israelite movement is best known for its confrontational brand of street preaching in urban areas but it has a complex history in the United States, with sects and branches splintering over theological and leadership disputes. Scholars say what unites most Black Israelites is the belief that African-Americans are the true descendants of biblical Jews.Some members have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the past.Anderson served in the US Army Reserve from September 1999 to September 2003, the Army said, as a fuel and electrical system repairer.Funerals guarded by police and volunteersTwo of the four victims were laid to rest Wednesday night.In Jersey City, crowds of men in black hats surrounded Ferencz's casket in the Jersey City neighborhood of Greenville at the site of a synagogue under construction. Hundreds of women, separated from the men as per Orthodox Jewish tradition, were standing in the bitter cold sobbing.Ferencz owned the store with her husband, who was next door at the small synagogue at the time of the attack, according to Yossi Steinmetz who was there as well.When shots broke out, her husband desperately tried to call her and tell her to lock the doors to take cover, Steinmetz said. She didn't answer.At Deutsch's Brooklyn funeral, mourners spoke in Hebrew through tears as at least a dozen NYPD counterterrorism officers and nearly 100 ""Shomrim"" members -- Hebrew for guardians -- stood watch.Deutsch and Ferencz both had ties to the Jewish community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.""This is just an atrocity. Of course, we accept everything but this is more than we can handle,"" Deutsch's cousin, also named Moshe Deutsch, told CNN. ""The question is, is it a sign of hatred? Is it a sign that we are not safe in New York anymore?""CNN's Melanie Schuman, Alec Snyder, Alexandra Field, Rob Frehse, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Nicole Chavez and Julian Cummings contributed to this report."
Chicago nightclub faces second lawsuit over alleged sexual assault,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/el-hefe-lawsuit-alleged-sexual-assault/index.html," (CNN)A second woman has filed a lawsuit against the Chicago nightclub, El Hefe, alleging she was sexually assaulted after being slipped a drug while drinking at the bar.Elizabeth Capra, in her civil complaint filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, claims in October 2014 she was given a drink laced with acetone, a substance used as a ""date rape drug.""  ""That evening I was out with a few girlfriends watching a Bears game,"" Capra told reporters on Monday. ""I was sitting at the bar and ordered my own drink. Had one drink. I don't really remember anything after that, but my two girlfriends who were with me at the time told me I started acting extremely, extremely out of the ordinary, extremely intoxicated very fast."" Capra said at one point her friends went to the bathroom, but when they came back they couldn't find her. El Hefe allowed Capra ""to leave the premises after being drugged, where she was sexually assaulted,"" the lawsuit said. El Hefe gave ""substantial assistance and encouragement to the drugging and sexual assault of the Plaintiff, by removing its video surveillance footage,"" the suit said. The complaint said the club initially said it reviewed footage and could not identify Capra. El Hefe told police that it had no recordings for that evening, according to the complaint.The lawsuit does not identify a possible assailant.Lissa Druss, a spokesperson for 15 Hubbard LLC, which owns El Hefe, said an internal review is underway. ""Reports like these in any part of our city are very disturbing. What I can tell you is the ownership of El Hefe is working very closely with the police department and City of Chicago to get to the bottom of what happened in these instances,"" she said.   Capra said she came forward after seeing video related to the alleged assault of a woman on October 18 of this year.That woman claimed she was approached by an unknown man who continued to buy her drinks. A bartender noticed the man make sexual advances and said her condition was ""rapidly deteriorating"" after consuming drinks the man purchased, according to the lawsuit. The bartender, who is not named, believed the woman had been drugged, the lawsuit said.Jane Doe's lawsuit alleges employees escorted her to an alley behind the business and stood by as a man allegedly sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated. Lawyers for the woman say they believe the alleged assailant either works at the business or knows someone on the staff. They released a security camera video, which they say police obtained from a nearby business. The video appears to show a man guiding a stumbling woman down an alley as two other men stand by a doorway. El Hefe posted a statement saying security typically escort ill patrons to the back exit. It claims its security staff did not witness a sexual assault.Capra, in speaking to reporters, said both lawsuits show ""this is not an isolated incident."" Her lawsuit contends El Hefe was negligent and the club ""created an atmosphere of toxic misogyny at its bar that encourages gender violence."" Capra said she went to the hospital after the 2014 incident. According to the lawsuit, a rape kit confirmed she had been assaulted and a toxicology report said she had been slipped acetone.Capra and her attorneys said they believe Chicago police are performing a thorough investigation.Police responded to CNN's request for more information about the alleged incident in 2014, saying the request was received and is being processed.""We are extremely proud of Liz for coming forward and being brave enough to tell her story,"" said attorney Brian Monico. The same law firm represents both women.Capra and her attorneys are calling on Mayor Lori Lightfoot to close the bar immediately. CNN has reached out to Lightfoot's office for a response on the request. CNN's Darran Simon, Amanda Watts, Ralph Ellis and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report. "
Police release 911 calls from shootout with men who stole UPS truck,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/911-calls-florida-ups-truck-police-chase-trnd/index.html,"Many of the calls came from people who found themselves in a police shootout when a hijacked UPS truck came to a stop at a crowded intersection in Miramar, a city in South Florida. As gunfire erupted, the vehicles stopped at the traffic light became shields for the police officers trying to stop two suspects, who had taken over the UPS truck after robbing a jewelry store. Of those who called, many did so to report bullet holes in their cars. The calls were released by the Miramar Police Department.One woman said her car was right next to the UPS truck. She managed to wiggle out, she says in her call, but her car was still damaged.Another man, whose truck was caught in the crossfire, told the operator the bullets passed ""all the way through my truck,"" including his daughter's car seat. ""Thank God"" she wasn't there, he said.One woman, calling from a beauty salon close to the incident, said she saw all her coworkers running, though she didn't hear the gunshots herself. Another man called on behalf of his wife, who was at a nearby beauty salon, heard the gunshots and got scared. Another woman's tire was shot, leaving her car stranded. When asked if she was OK, she said, ""I'm all right, I just got a little shaken up. But I was able to get away eventually.""How a robbery turned into a police chaseThe shooting in Miramar began when two suspects robbed Regent Jewelers in Coral Gables, authorities said. At least one woman was hurt in the initial robbery.While attempting to flee the crime scene, the suspects hijacked the UPS truck, taking the driver hostage and speeding away. The suspects made it at least 25 miles away, hopping curbs, maneuvering around other vehicles and dodging police. The chase ended at the intersection of Miramar Parkway and Flamingo Road, just over an hour after the initial robbery. The truck was boxed in by rush-hour traffic, and more than 40 police and emergency vehicles were in its wake.Officers exited their vehicles and used the surrounding cars as shields to approach the UPS truck. It is unclear who opened fire first In the chaos, the two robbery suspects, the UPS truck driver taken hostage and a man driving home from work, were killed.The UPS driver was Frank Ordonez, a 27-year-old man who relatives say had been substituting for a colleague who had called out from work that day.The man driving home from work was 70-year-old Richard Steven Cutshaw, according to the Broward County, Florida, medical examiner's office.The slain robbers and hijackers were Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, both of Miami-Dade County, the FBI said."
Newark sues New York over homeless relocation program,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/newark-new-york-homeless-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN)The city of Newark, New Jersey, filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the city of New York to stop their program of relocating homeless residents to the Newark area.The lawsuit also lists New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks as defendants. It claims that the Special One-Time Assistance program, also known as SOTA, had case workers pressure eligible people in shelters to move outside of New York City and didn't effectively check on the conditions of the apartments in which they were placed.It says that when SOTA recipients contacted SOTA case workers about the conditions and lack of action by landlords, case workers claimed they could no longer help them because they were now residents of Newark. ""Newark is concerned about the living conditions of perhaps one thousand or more SOTA recipients,"" the lawsuit says. ""From the small sample of SOTA recipients that Newark was able to identify, Newark has become aware of families, including those with infants, that are living in uninhabitable conditions.  This includes issues with lack of heat, electricity, excessive vermin, and dangerous living conditions."" Avery Cohen, deputy press secretary for de Blasio's office, called the lawsuit ""wrong, hypocritical, and amounts to nothing short of income-based discrimination.""""In the face of a regional housing crisis, the City of Newark has inexplicably taken a page from the Trump playbook, building a wall to single out and prevent families from seeking housing where they want to live,"" Cohen said.The SOTA program provides working individuals or families who've been in a shelter for at least 90 days with one year's rent paid in full to move into housing within New York City or another state, according to the New York City Human Resources Administration website. Newark claims the defendants ""refuse to disclose"" everyone placed in Newark under SOTA, according to the lawsuit. It is not immediately clear how many people have participated in the SOTA program. In the lawsuit, filed in the District of New Jersey, five families shared detailed accounts of their subpar housing and how SOTA case workers allegedly said they couldn't help. They described deteriorating apartment interiors and lack of heat or electricity, with landlords who were unwilling to fix the problems.In one case, a family said they reported the conditions to the city of Newark and the building was condemned. In another case described in the suit, a family's babysitter quit because there was no heat or electricity, and the mother lost her job when she had to take care of her children.Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, a New York City-based advocacy group, said that while the program is flawed, the real problem lies with lack of quality, affordable housing from either city. ""Homeless families are being caught in the middle,"" Routhier said. Mark Di Ionno, interim director of communications for Newark, said ""Mayor (Ras) Baraka and Mayor de Blasio are making plans to meet to discuss the situation,"" and he would withhold comment until then."
The family whose toddler fell to her death from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship sues the company,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/us/royal-caribbean-toddler-death-lawsuit-trnd/index.html," (CNN)The family whose child died falling from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in July has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the cruise line. Michael Winkleman, the family's attorney, said at a news conference the ""singular goal"" of the lawsuit is to raise awareness about the risk of falling from windows and ""prevent this from ever happening to another child again.""Chloe Wiegand, 18 months old, was playing on a Royal Caribbean ship docked in Puerto Rico with her grandfather, Salvatore ""Sam"" Anello, when she fell from an open glass window to her death. The lawsuit says the glass panes on the deck can be slid open by any passenger, and the walls didn't contain warnings that the panes could open. Chloe's family argues the cruise line failed to comply with industry safety standards to prevent guests from falling from windows.Kimberly Wiegand said the cruise line ""played a major role"" in the toddler's death. She said she hopes the lawsuit improves safety on board for children and families.""If this lawsuit prevents another death, then it is worth it to us,"" she said.Royal Caribbean spokesman Jonathon Fishman declined to comment on the civil filing when reached by CNN.""Our hearts go out to the family for their tragic loss. Mr. Salvatore Anello is currently being criminally prosecuted for negligent homicide in the case,"" Fishman said.  The fallIn July, Anello was supervising Chloe on the 11th deck of the Royal Caribbean ship Freedom of the Seas, according to the suit.The lawsuit says Chloe wandered over to a wall of floor-to-ceiling glass on the deck, and he didn't realize one of the panes was open. The suit says Chloe asked to be lifted up to bang on the glass, something she did frequently at her brother's hockey games. Anello hoisted her up and she leaned forward, but she slipped from his hands through the open pane and fell 150 feet onto the San Juan Pier, according to the suit. She died from the fall. Anello told CBS News he wouldn't have placed the toddler near the window if he'd known it was open. He noted that he's colorblind, which might explain why he didn't notice the tinted glass was open. ""If there were some kind of warning sign, we wouldn't even have been near it.""Grandfather charged with negligent homicide The details of Chloe's death have been disputed since the accident. Officials for the port authority said her grandfather sat her in the window, lost his balance and the toddler fell to her death. Puerto Rican authorities charged Anello with negligent homicide.Wiegand said she doesn't support the charges against Chloe's grandfather, who is her stepfather. ""I want to be clear and unequivocal: We do not support this misdemeanor charge or any charges whatsoever,"" Wiegand said. ""We are here today as a family supporting one another and we will continue to do so. Our family has already lost everything; what purpose could possibly be served by prosecuting a misdemeanor offense?"" Anello told CBS News he initially blamed himself for Chloe's death. Now, he blames the cruise line. ""I just want them to fix the boat. Just fix it. Just fix the boat."" The girl would've celebrated her second birthday this weekChloe would've turned 2 this week, Wiegand said. She ""spread happiness wherever she went"" and gave ""wet kisses and big hugs,"" Wiegand said. ""We should be celebrating with a present and a birthday cake, but instead we're here talking about her death,"" she said. ""I spend my evenings visiting with her urn rather than rocking my little girl to sleep."" Wiegand asked people to do random acts of kindness on Friday in her daughter's memory."
New York City Ballet's 'Nutcracker' has cast a black Marie for the first time,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/charlotte-nebres-nyc-ballet-nutcracker-trnd/index.html," (CNN)For the first time, New York City Ballet has cast a black Marie in its annual production of ""George Balanchine's The Nutcracker,"" which premiered in 1954.This season, the leading role of the young heroine is being played by 11-year-old Charlotte Nebres. But for Charlotte, who grew up with role models like Misty Copeland, it just reaffirms that nothing can hold her back.When her mother Danielle Nebres told her she was the first black Marie, the New York Times reported, she simply responded: ""Wow. That seems a little late.""Dena Abergel, children's ballet master at New York City Ballet, acknowledged that the casting decision was a significant milestone. But Charlotte wasn't cast because of the color of her skin or as part of a diversity initiative, she said.Charlotte simply had everything she was looking for in the character of Marie. ""When I'm looking for someone who can do Marie, I'm looking for someone primarily who has an ability to act on stage and to convey a story,"" said Abergel. ""... It has to be someone who can command the stage and who has enough confidence and spontaneity to handle whatever comes her way.""Abergel already knew Charlotte quite well.She had her as a student at the School of American Ballet, a feeder school for New York City Ballet. And Charlotte had also performed with the ballet company in last year's Nutcracker and a production of Sleeping Beauty.And when the time came for casting for this season's production of the Nutcracker in late September, Charlotte impressed again.Sometimes when Abergel tells young dancers that they have a role, they jump up and down and scream excitedly.An interesting thing about Charlotte, Abergel said, is that she's more expressive onstage than offstage. She's ""not an extroverted person,"" so it was hard to tell how she really felt about landing the role.When Charlotte emerged from her ""Nutcracker"" audition, she surprised even her mother.  ""With that poker face of hers, she said, 'Well, I'm Marie,'"" Nebres told The New York Times. ""And I just thought, oh my goodness -- they really did it. I couldn't believe it.""The school has made an effort to diversifyThe cast of New York City Ballet's production is particularly diverse this season.In addition to Charlotte, the other young leads are also children of color. Tanner Quirk, who plays Charlotte's Prince is half-Chinese, according to The New York Times. The children are always double cast, and Sophia Thomopoulos, who plays the other Marie, is half-Korean, half-Greek. Her Prince is Kai Misra-Stone, who is half-South Asian.Abergel said she had no idea what backgrounds the dancers were from until it was reported in the media. Instead, she said, this year's cast is a reflection of the ""tremendous"" effort that the School of American Ballet has made to diversify its student body in recent years. About half of the students of the school are ""diverse,"" she said, which means that the students in front of her while she's casting will inevitably come from varied backgrounds.""Because I have the diversity of students and the pool to choose from that is diverse, some of those students will end up being the leads and it just happened to work out without my even realizing it that all four were of some mixed diversity,"" Abergel said. ""And that's just mirroring what's happening in New York City and around the world."""

John Bel Edwards is feeling good. He just won re-election, and now he's making a splashy bet on Saturday's LSU-Georgia game for the SEC Championship.Well, he's betting seafood. And he sounds pretty confident.Edwards has made a friendly bet with his counterpart in Georgia over Saturday afternoon's game, which pits 12-0 LSU against 11-1 Georgia for the Southeastern Conference football title in Atlanta.The stakes were already high. LSU sits second and Georgia fourth in the College Football Playoff rankings. Georgia very much could use a win to get into the four-team college football championship playoff.Edwards challenged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to the bet on Friday. He'll give Kemp some grub from Baton Rouge's Tony's Seafood if LSU loses.Not that he thinks he'll need to pay up.""I'm not worried about having to cover this bet because I firmly believe Joe Burrow and the LSU Tigers, coached by Louisiana's own Ed Orgeron, are going to be hoisting the SEC championship trophy on Saturday,"" Edwards said on video posted to Facebook and Twitter.Kemp responded, saying he'll wager a gift basket of Georgia produce on Georgia's victory. One might think peaches will be involved, but Kemp didn't give specifics.""We've got a Georgia Grown gift basket that we're putting up for the Georgia side,"" Kemp said in a video on Twitter Friday.""However, the Dawgs are going to win, so we look forward to keeping that right home with us and sharing it with our Georgia friends. Let's go Dawgs, so we can beat the Tigers on Saturday."""
The Clarence Thomas myth that refuses to die,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/us/clarence-thomas-white-conservatives-blake/index.html," (CNN)It's the horror movie villain that won't die, the pop song you can't get out of your head, the out-of-town guest that just won't leave.It's a belief that's stuck like a tick in the collective memory of some white conservatives. It's the notion that black people despise Clarence Thomas because he's a conservative.It's not only a myth but a con. Here's why it matters now.We are about to hear a lot about, and from, the only black member of the US Supreme Court. A new Thomas biography, ""The Enigma of Clarence Thomas,"" is generating buzz. A new PBS documentary, ""Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,"" comes out next year. And a Washington Post writer recently dedicated an entire column to Thomas, calling him ""an American hero.""It's all adding up to another public reappraisal of arguably the most conservative member of the Supreme Court. He's someone more people would revere if they only knew him better, says columnist Kathleen Parker.Here's my question to people who say or imply black people revile Thomas because he's a conservative: If black people are so opposed to conservatives, why have so many accepted black conservatives such as Booker T. Washington, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice?If there is going to be a reevaluation of one of the most powerful black figures in the US, it's time we ground it in facts, not myths.Thomas isn't despised in the black community because he's a conservative. Many dislike him because they see him as a hypocrite and a traitor.Yet many white conservatives keep recycling the same selective stories about Thomas. These stories don't just distort black culture -- they carry an undercurrent of racism. He's not the only black leader who talks about self-relianceStart with the way conservatives celebrate Thomas' upbringing.They love to tell tales about his rugged self-reliance: growing up in a Georgia shack without plumbing; the stern grandfather who worked him from sunrise to sunset and once told him that ""Old Man Can't is dead. I helped bury him.""These are stories worth telling. Thomas deserves credit. Not enough people, frankly, give him credit for something else, his intellect. Some liberal critics flirt with racism in the way they describe Thomas as an intellectual lightweight.But the way some white conservatives tell the story of Thomas' rise from poverty also perpetuates racist stereotypes. They imply that Thomas and his hard working, no excuses grandfather are unusual characters in the black community. They depict Thomas as this lonely apostle of self-reliance, as if most black people prefer sitting on the couch drinking Kool-Aid while waiting for the government to send them a check.One journalist praised Thomas in 2017 for being the product of a ""caring, supervised, value-laden upbringing, compared with a more usual poor, fatherless black childhood"" marked by ""victimhood.""Even Thomas has reinforced this notion of pervasive black dependency. He gave a speech in the 1980s before a group of black conservatives where he said of his sister: ""She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That`s how dependent she is. What`s worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.'' Here's some news:  Black people have been practicing self-reliance for centuries. We've had to, for survival. We know through bitter experience that white America's investment in racial equality is sporadic. Racial progress has always been followed by a ""whitelash.""Thomas' stern grandfather is a familiar figure in the black community. Plenty of black people can tell you stories of grandparents, pastors, teachers, and coaches who all preached the same message: Rely on yourself, because you can't rely on white people.It's almost impossible to find a revered black leader who didn't preach some form of this message.Even President Obama, the so-called ""radial socialist"" who wanted to ""redistribute the wealth,"" sounded many times like Thomas' grandfather.It was Obama who chided black parents for allegedly feeding their children ""cold Popeye's"" chicken for breakfast and black boys for wearing a ""eight-pound chain around your neck."" He once told a group of black college students, ""Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured."" Obama lectured black people so much about not using racism as a crutch that some commentators criticized him for it.But you rarely, if ever, hear white conservatives acknowledge this history. They're still stuck on the Ronald Reagan ""Welfare Queen"" narrative about black dependency. He cast an 'atrocious' vote against black AmericaThere's something else many white conservatives miss: The contradiction between Thomas' words and actions.Thomas has lectured blacks about not defining themselves as racial victims. He once criticized civil rights leaders who he said, ""B*tch, b*tch, b*tch, moan and moan and whine"" about the Reagan administration.But when his nomination to the Supreme Court was threatened by Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment, he played the race card by saying he was the victim of a ""high-tech lynching.""Thomas has lectured blacks about the evils of affirmative action. Yet he made it into Yale Law School because of an affirmative action program.  ""His entire career is a result of thrusts for diversity that he would deny in others,"" Lawrence Goldstone, author of ""On Account of Race: The Supreme Court, White Supremacy, and the Ravaging of African American Voting Rights,"" told me.""How many highly talented black or Hispanic kids are out there who could really make a difference if only the starting line was staggered to take into account how much baggage they're carrying.""Then there was Thomas' public confrontation in 1991 with Anita Hill, the black woman who accused of him of sexual harassment. Many black women, in particular, still believe that he lied when he denied sexually harassing Hill. Thomas vigorously denied that he did anything wrong. ""A large portion, if not the majority, of black women over time began to think that Clarence Thomas may have in fact lied and that he almost certainly did,"" says Ravi Perry, chair of the political science department at Howard University.But it's Thomas' voting record that has cemented the cynicism many blacks feel toward him.Critics say he has consistently voted against black people as well as other marginalized groups: women, LGBTQ people, religious minorities and death row inmates.He is the first Supreme Court justice to openly criticize the high court's landmark civil rights ruling, Brown v. Board of Education.And he joined a 2013 high court decision -- Shelby County v. Holder -- that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of the civil rights movement.His vote on Shelby contributed to ""the most unjustifiable and hurtful decision imposed on black America in the past half century,"" Randall Kennedy, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, wrote in a recent article on Thomas.""It is atrocious, right alongside such judicial delinquencies as Plessy v. Ferguson, Giles v. Harris, and Korematsu v. United States,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Yet here is Thomas providing a crucial vote to cripple legislation for which the proponents of racial justice marched, bled, and in some instances died.'' He has a bleak vision of integrationYou won't hear many white conservatives address these deeper questions that many black people have about Thomas. Why is that?I have a theory. It's part of what I call the Clarence Thomas con -- a way to divert people's attention away from the more unpleasant aspects of Thomas' legacy. It's far easier to mislead the public about the true nature of Thomas' isolation in the black community than to defend accusations that his judicial decisions harm black people and other marginalized groups. Or to deny charges that his opposition to affirmative action is ""at war with his own biography.""Focusing on Thomas' biography also takes away attention from his pessimistic views about integration and some white Americans.One of the reasons why The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech still captivates people is because he portrayed a future America where whites and blacks would ""be able to sit down at a table of brotherhood."" It's a beautiful vision of an integrated America for which countless people literally died. But I wonder if many people understand Thomas' bleak view of racial progress. He is a persistent critic of integration. He once said, ""The whole push to assimilate simply does not make sense to me.""  He's also skeptical about white America's ability to see past skin color.He once told a black reporter:  ""There is nothing you can do to get past black skin. I don't care how educated you are, how good you are at what you do -- you'll never have the same contacts or opportunities, you'll never be seen as equal to whites."" Thomas believes that ""white supremacy is ineradicable in America,"" says Corey Robin, author of ""The Enigma of Clarence Thomas,"" a new biography that has earned widespread praise. ""Thomas does not believe that politics in any sense of that term — electoral politics, social movements, state action and regulation, organizing, even more radical notions of transformative change — can positively affect black people; he thinks politics mostly hurts black people."" Thomas was even unimpressed when the US elected Obama, the first black president. He said that a black person could only become president if the ""elites"" and ""the media"" picked him or her.Thomas' skepticism about integration, though, is not rare in the black community. It's not uncommon to hear black people say in private that integration hurt them in some ways because their children were put into schools with white teachers who didn't believe in them, and their institutions were weakened. Thomas alluded to this belief while talking about one of his heroes, Malcolm X, in a 1987 interview. ""I don't see how the civil-rights people today can claim Malcolm X as one of their own. Where does he say black people should go begging the Labor Department for jobs? He was hell on integrationists. Where does he say you should sacrifice your institutions to be next to white people? He forgets his historyHere is where Thomas loses many black people.He laments what black people lost due to integration. He praises black individuals like his grandfather who were able to build their own businesses and live with dignity despite segregation. Individual excellence seems to be his solution for racism.""I am confident that the individual approach, not the group approach, is the better, more acceptable, more supportable and less dangerous"" approach to dealing with racism, Thomas once told a meeting of black lawyers.But here's the not-so-big secret of segregation that people like Thomas never mention: ""Separate but equal"" never gave blacks anything that was actually equal. They could never get the same economic resources or political power under the ""separate but equal"" world of Jim Crow.His grandfather might have lived a blameless life and become a millionaire. But he still could have been denied the right to vote, banned from entering white colleges or strung up by a lynch mob for something as absurd as ""reckless eyeballing"" during segregation.Individual black excellence was never enough. Black people had to mobilize as a group to demand political power before life got better.""You can't individually achieve your way out of racism. The remedy is collective,"" The New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote about Thomas.If other black leaders had adopted Thomas' belief that they could never get past their dark skin, or that the individual approach was better, there would have been no ""Brown vs. Board of Education,"" no ""I Have a Dream,"" and no Obama.There would have been no Thomas on the Supreme Court. He tells powerful white people what they want to hearThen there is another part of Thomas' persona that alienates some black people. White conservatives often portray him as a courageous truth-teller because he tells black people what they don't want to hear. Here's another truth they ignore: It doesn't take a lot of courage for a black person to tell powerful white people want they want to hear. In fact, they get plenty of rewards for doing so.I know this from a personal experience.I was a rookie reporter at a Southern newspaper when Thomas was nominated to the US Supreme Court in 1991. I was criticized by several black journalists after I wrote an essay defending Thomas. One famous black journalist called me a ""house n*****."" I said then what I believe now: There is no one way to be black any more than there is one way to be white. Respect Thomas' decision to be an independent thinker. After my essay was published, a new world opened before me. A conservative white editor at the paper took me out to lunch and invited me to become an editorial columnist even though I was barely out of college. Interview requests poured in. I was invited to speak on national television. People thought I was a black conservative.I've seen this pattern over and over: If you're a black journalist who wants to lecture black people about not whining about racism and playing the victim, your career will blossom. Conservative institutions it seems will always find a place for black-on-black critics.CNN legal contributor Jeffrey Toobin touched on this part of Thomas' courageous truth-teller persona in a New Yorker profile of the Supreme Court justice. Toobin recounted a memorable speech by Thomas at a conservative, black-tie affair led by then Vice-President Dick Cheney. Thomas told the crowd that although he had suffered for speaking out, ""Be not afraid.""Toobin caps the story by saying: ""On this night, in other words, Thomas, while celebrating the courage to speak unpopular truths, was telling some of the most powerful people in the worlds of government, business, and finance precisely what they wanted to hear—that affirmative action was bad, that black people didn't want or need their help, that government did more harm than good.""Thomas has employed his powerful position not to speak truth to power, but to tell power what it wants to hear, according to many black people. That's why Thomas has been called the ""anti-Thurgood Marshall,"" or the antithesis of the Supreme Court's first black justice. ""If you're a black person who rises to a high level in politics or law, many folks in the black community expect you to use that position to better the living conditions of people who look like you or at the very least speak truth to power,"" says Perry of Howard University.  ""Clarence Thomas has done neither.""But unlike Marshall, Thomas won't be widely celebrated in the black community. There likely won't be any movement to build schools, erect statues or name roads after him. His name was barely mentioned in the National Museum of African American History and Culture when it opened in 2016 (the museum said it couldn't tell ""every story"" of black America). Yet his stature will probably grow as the Supreme Court's new conservative majority asserts itself. We will continue to hear stories about Thomas' work ethic, his stern grandfather, the price he paid for telling black people to stand on their own.These stories, though, are decoys that lead people away from a richer discussion of Thomas' legacy -- his impressive rise from poverty, yes, but also his contradictions, his scorn for integration, his belief that ""There is nothing you can do to get past black skin."" Don't fall for the Clarence Thomas con."

After leading the US Women's National Soccer team to a World Cup title in June, the legend scored yet another victory.Rapinoe has been named Sports Illustrated's 2019 Sportsperson of the Year. The midfielder, who captains the professional Seattle Reign FC, also won the Ballon d'Or award last week, given annually to the world's best soccer players.

Mother of Georgetown student becomes 53rd person charged in college admissions scam,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/college-scam-georgetown-test/index.html," (CNN)A California woman paid over $9,000 to have a person affiliated with Rick Singer's college counseling business take online classes for her son so he could graduate Georgetown University, according to the Department of Justice.Karen Littlefair, 57, of Newport Beach will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud as part of a plea deal announced on Monday, according to court documents. Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of four months in prison, one year of supervised release, a fine of $9,500 and an order to pay restitution.Ken Julian, Littlefair lawyer, told CNN ""My client has taken the earliest opportunity to take responsibility for her conduct.""Littlefair is the 53rd person to be charged in the sprawling college admissions scam first announced in March. Singer was the mastermind of a brazen scheme to cheat on standardized tests and bribe college coaches in order to help wealthy parents game the admissions system. He has pleaded guilty to several charges and has been cooperating with prosecutors.Littlefair paid Singer's college counseling business, known as ""The Key,"" to have an employee complete online classes in her son's name, the criminal information states. She ultimately paid Singer's company about $9,000 in exchange for an employee taking four classes, and Littlefair's son graduated from Georgetown in May 2018, prosecutors said.Singer wrote to Littlefair on June 1, 2017, that ""we have someone to take the classes"" and that he would ""let you know what it will take to complete so we can bill,"" the court documents state. She paid $6,197 to The Key on August 4, 2017, for two online classes offered by Georgetown, the documents state.One of the classes required video conferences with the professor. Littlefair wrote that her son would be out of the country and that Singer's employee ""should have a stand in for [my son] that is highly briefed."" The Key associate confirmed she would ""take care of the meeting"" if the son was unavailable by using a ""fellow male colleague"" to stand in for Littlefair's son, the documents state.Littlefair also sent an email asking Singer to do ""one more online course"" in spring 2018 for credit at Georgetown, and the Key associate then secretly took an online class in her son's name offered by Arizona State University. The credits were then sent to Georgetown and credited to Littlefair's son on his academic transcript, the court documents say, helping him graduate.In April 2018, Singer's company sent her an invoice for $3,000. She responded that she thought she'd be given a ""discount"" because the ""grade [Key associate 1 earned] was a C and the experience was a nightmare!"" according to the criminal information.Singer replied that he would not discount the invoice because the ""process was a nightmare for all."" Littlefair then paid The Key $3,000, the documents state.CNN's Evan Simko-Bednarski contributed to this report"
ICE detained a high school sophomore. His teachers tried to send him homework so he wouldn't fall behind,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/10/us/new-haven-student-detained-ice/index.html,"New Haven, Connecticut  (CNN)The principal's voice piped through the PA system at Wilbur Cross High School with a startling announcement.ICE had detained a student. ""Everyone was worried and asking around,"" says Sandy Martinez-Paz, a 17-year-old junior at the school. ""We wanted to know who it was.""Students later learned that Mario Aguilar, an 18-year-old who enrolled in the school last year, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at a nearby courthouse where he'd gone to face charges after a traffic accident.It's the kind of case that unfolds frequently across the United States, but often goes unnoticed or quickly fades from view.At Wilbur Cross, something different happened.The school where many were still getting to know Mario began fighting to bring him back.Teachers bundled up homework to send to Mario in ICE detention, hoping their student wouldn't fall behind or feel forgotten. They wrote letters pushing for his release. And they showed up to support him in court. Students designed ""Free Mario"" protest posters in the school's print shop. They put his face on a sticker and sold it to raise money for his commissary. And for weeks, they kept his desk in Spanish class empty, hoping he'd return. Now Mario's supporters at the school are anxiously awaiting an immigration judge's ruling in his asylum case and planning next steps in their push to free him -- undeterred by the fact that so far, their efforts haven't swayed authorities.Many feel the dangers of doing nothing are far too great. If Mario's deported to Guatemala, a country he fled, they fear it could be a death sentence. And if they don't stand up for him, they fear that no one will. He went to court alone and left in ICE custodyMario Aguilar headed to court in Milford, Connecticut, alone on September 10 to face the charges against him.After a car accident a month earlier, police had arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence, operating a motor vehicle without a license and failure to insure a private motor vehicle. They released him from custody on a promise to appear in court.Advocates for the teen say he crashed into a parked car after his cell phone slid off the dashboard and he reached down to pick it up. They argue a sobriety test was never performed and the DUI charge wouldn't have held up in court. But a state court judge never had a chance to hear that argument.As the 18-year-old got into line at the courthouse, someone said his name.  He turned around, and moments later, he was in ICE custody. ""Deportation officers arrested Mario Andres Aguilar-Castanon, an illegally-present citizen of Guatemala, at the Milford Superior Court for immigration violations,"" ICE spokesman John Mohan said in a statement, adding that removal proceedings are pending.Mohan said the teenager was arrested by US Border Patrol agents near the Southwest border in March 2018 and issued a notice to appear in immigration court before he was released from custody. ""He failed to appear in immigration court,"" Mohan said -- a claim Mario's lawyers dispute.They say Mario was 16 years old when he came to the United States from Guatemala in 2018 as an ""unaccompanied minor,"" the US government's term for children who cross the border alone, without parents or guardians. And that he isn't aware of receiving any paperwork about a court date when he was released from US custody.  No one at Wilbur Cross knew any of this the week of September 10. At the high school where he was taking classes like Geometry, Modern World History and Band, only one thing was clear. Mario had been at his desk on Monday. By Tuesday, he was gone.For days, the school thought he had gone missingMia Breuler still remembers the dread she felt when she learned her student had disappeared.She frantically searched for him for days.The school counselor knew it wasn't like Mario to miss so much class, or to stop showing up at the store where he worked stocking shelves. She called everyone she could think of as questions raced through her mind.Was he in an accident? Had gangs attacked him? Or had he gotten into some kind of trouble? There was no sign of him at local hospitals. Police didn't know where he went either.""One officer said to me, 'Are you sure he's not with a girlfriend or something?'""Breuler knew that wasn't what happened, but still, there was no sign of her student. A missed call Mario's cousin got from a Massachusetts number eventually led the counselor to call the Bristol County House of Corrections in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where officials confirmed Mario was being held.That, Breuler says, was a ""triage moment.""""It was shocking on all sorts of levels. It was very upsetting. I was anxiety-ridden because I was thinking, 'Now what do I do? ... Where do I go? ... Where do I begin to try to get help for this kid?'""Unable to reach his family for weeks, Mario called his school instead.Breuler spoke to him almost every day. When she heard his voice, she didn't let her anxiety show. She asked if he felt safe. She told him not to give up hope.She wanted him to know he wasn't alone.The principal got emotional about her missing studentWilbur Cross Principal Edith Johnson stood on the steps of New Haven's City Hall, wearing a jacket with the school's official colors, red and white. ""Cross pride!"" the crowd shouted as she took the microphone. Students around her cheered.But the mood turned somber as Johnson began to discuss how Mario's detention had shaken her.""Our school community is suffering,"" Johnson said as local news cameras rolled. ""He is missing from our classrooms, from our hallways, from our cafeteria.""Johnson didn't plan to get emotional at the rally that day in October. She's been the principal of Wilbur Cross since 2013. And as the leader of a school with some 1,600 students, she's seen many struggling to deal with trauma. But nothing like this -- a student being detained by ICE -- had ever happened during her time there. As she spoke of her student, she began to think of her own family's story -- of how her parents struggled when they came to New York from Puerto Rico in the '40s and '50s. She thought of how lonely and scared Mario must be in detention, and how eager he'd seemed to learn. The tears began to flow.She told the crowd that in her career as an educator and administrator, she'd lost far too many students to violence and tragedy.""And now, another terrifying variable certain to take students off course,"" she said, ""ICE arrests.""Mario's teacher attended his asylum hearingThe day Mario made his case for asylum in a Boston immigration court, Mary Perez Estrada saw him from across the room and waved.The Spanish teacher's heart sank as she saw him try to lift his hand to wave back. He couldn't. His hands were shackled. It was a week before Thanksgiving. Mario had only been in her class for a few weeks when he was detained, but she'd already seen his promise as a student. The way he'd ask questions and take on extra work particularly stood out. He'd told her he dreamed of becoming a biologist. On a questionnaire she had students fill out at the beginning of the year, when asked to describe something interesting about himself, he wrote, ""Me gusta trabajar y esforzarme, a pesar de estar solo en este pais."" I like to work and strive, despite being alone in this country.When the school's assistant principal asked teachers to gather homework to send him, Perez Estrada pulled out books from her personal collection that she hoped would help his mind escape, even if he was trapped inside a detention center's walls.She wrote smiley faces inside the covers to keep his spirits up.She thought of him every morning in her homeroom, and each time she taught her third period Spanish class. His last name -- Aguilar -- is still first on the attendance list. For weeks, students kept his desk empty, hoping he'd return. As Mario spoke before the court, detailing how he'd fled persecution from gangs in Guatemala, Perez Estrada hoped the judge would see what she did in her student -- someone who deserves a chance.The judge didn't make a ruling that day. He told the court he'd announce his decision on December 12.Perez Estrada headed outside to share what she'd seen with dozens of students and activists who'd been waiting for word on what had happened.""Mario we love you,"" the students chanted before they piled back onto a bus to return to New Haven. ""Mario we're with you.""Mario we are fighting with you.""We believe in you.""We got you.""Every day.""Even after today.""We will stand with you.""Because we love you.""Because you're family.""Because you're our community.""Inside, they hoped he could hear their voices.Students are making a video to share his storyGabriela Gonzalez didn't know Mario before. Most students didn't, she says. But lately, she's been spending a lot of her free time learning his story.The senior at Wilbur Cross studied filmmaking for years as a student in the school's International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences. Now she's helping make a film for a schoolwide assembly to teach her classmates about this case and why it matters.In a conference room near the principal's office on a Friday afternoon, she peppers students from the school's ""Cross in Action"" immigrant advocacy group with questions.""Why is this important?"" she asks.""The kids in school are stressed and worried because it's close to home,"" one student replies. ""And they're scared because they probably think, 'What if I'm next?'""""It's a story that should be heard all over. It's something that it isn't new. It hasn't just started happening. It's something that's going on around the whole country,"" another student says. ""And everyone needs to know the reality people that come here face. It's not like it's easy for them. They go through so much and people don't understand or don't see it.""As she takes a break from an afternoon of interviews, Gonzalez notes that only Mario's closest friends knew him before. They've shared stories with her about how they'd walk to school together or go out to eat. But now, she says, even students who never met him can see the symbolism in his story.""He wasn't known before, but now literally there's posters around the school with his face on it everywhere. People didn't know about him because he was just a regular student. ... But now the fact that just this ordinary student was taken, his whole life has been turned upside down because he happens to be from somewhere else, shows that this can happen to anyone,"" she says. ""And it shouldn't happen to anyone, because we're all just trying to live our lives as teenagers or normal, everyday people walking around the street.""His homework was 'refused' and returned to senderAn immigration judge in Boston is weighing Mario's fate. His supporters had expected the judge to rule on Thursday, but instead learned in court that he'll be issuing a written decision soon.If the judge denies Mario's asylum claim, his lawyers say they'll appeal the ruling and keep fighting the government's efforts to deport him. And in the meantime, if he remains detained, they say they'll keep trying to get homework to him. So far, they haven't had any luck.Attorney Dalia Fuleihan says she tried to send the homework to the Bristol County House of Corrections -- first in an in-person meeting with her client, and then via US mail after she was told she could only hand him legal paperwork.She got the envelope of homework she'd sent back last month, stamped ""Return to sender. Refused."" A handwritten note on the stamp said, ""Unknown name"" and ""ID# required."" Asked why the homework was returned, an ICE spokesman said the agency doesn't comment on issues, claims or allegations that ""are not related to a detainee's enforcement status.""Back at Wilbur Cross, Mario's teachers say they're shocked he didn't receive the homework or the books they tried to send him. To them, it's another reminder that their student belongs in a classroom, not a jail cell.  Fuleihan has the returned envelope at her office at the New Haven Legal Assistance Association as she sorts out next steps. Inside it, for now, the teachers' messages remain unread. One teacher scribbled out instructions on yellow sticky notes placed on different pages in the packet.She put an assignment Mario started on one of his first days of class at the top of the pile, titled: ""Who Am I? My Past, Present and Future Hopes and Dreams."" On the first page, Mario wrote his name, stated where he was from and drew a picture of himself.He noted that he liked music and disliked avocados.""Mario -- Finish!"" the teacher's sticky note says. ""This is important."" The pages describing his future are still blank. "
A plaque dedicated to Matthew Shepard installed at Washington National Cathedral,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/matthew-shepard-plaque-dedicated-trnd/index.html," (CNN)Matthew Shepard died in 1998 after one of the most notorious and brutal anti-gay crimes in the US. Two decades later, he is being honored through a memorial plaque installed at the Washington National Cathedral. A memorial plaque for Shepard was installed Tuesday at the Episcopal cathedral, which is known for its historic inclusion of LGBTQ people in the church. His remains were interred there last year. The plaque notes his final resting place in the columbarium near the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea. It also includes words from Bishop Gene Robinson's homily last year: ""Matt, rest gently in this place. You are home safe now.""""We've given much thought to Matt's final resting place, and we found the Washington National Cathedral is an ideal choice, as Matt loved the Episcopal church and felt welcomed by his church in Wyoming,"" his mother Judy Shepard said in a news release. ""For the past 20 years, we have shared Matt's story with the world. It's reassuring to know he now will rest in a sacred spot where folks can come to reflect on creating a safer, kinder world.""Shepard died when he was 21 from injuries after he was attacked and left in a field during a hate crime. His death sparked outrage and led to years of advocacy and action in the LGBTQ movement. In 2009, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act made it a crime to commit violent acts against people because of their religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.On Monday, a day after what would have been Shepard's 43rd birthday, the Washington National Cathedral and the Matthew Shepard Foundation honored his legacy through a dedication ceremony. ""People around the world gave generously to make this memorial possible,"" his mother said in a news release. ""We're grateful for each gift that created this beautiful plaque that now marks Matt's final resting place. We hope this will be a place that forever offers solace and strength for all who visit.""Shepard's remains are held in the cathedral's West Crypt Columbarium but are not accessible to the public. Helen Keller's remains are also held in the same crypt. His plaque is mounted opposite Keller's own plaque.Over the past year, visitors have come to the chapel to honor Matthew Shepard by leaving notes, flowers, candles and other mementos that are preserved in the cathedral archives, a cathedral spokesperson said.""Finally, Matthew is home and he is safe,"" the Very Rev. Randolph ""Randy"" Marshall Hollerith said in a statement. ""Matthew's indelible legacy and the enduring strength and courage of his family and loved ones serve as a guiding force for all of us in how to confront bigotry by fostering greater love, acceptance and embrace of people of all backgrounds, gender identities and sexual orientations."""
Cruise line sexual assault reports for third quarter jump by 67 percent from 2018,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/cruise-line-sexual-assault-reports/index.html," (CNN)Cruise lines sailing from US ports reported 35 alleged sexual assaults in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 67% from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by the US Department of Transportation. Of the reports from July 1 to September 30, 27 were allegedly committed by passengers, five by crew members and three by other people, the chart says. Most of the incident reports were from the largest cruise line, Carnival, which had 20 alleged assaults -- 17 allegedly by passengers, one by a crew member and two by unspecified other people. Royal Caribbean had eight reports of sexual assault -- four by passengers, three by crew and one by an unspecified person. In all, 12 cruise lines submitted crime data through a federal law, the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act (CVSSA), which lays out security requirements for most ships embarking and disembarking in the US.In an emailed statement, Carnival said its passengers' safety and security were its top priority, and that it serves 6 million guests each year in a safe and secure environment.It also said its position on the list reflects the scope of its US operations, compared to other companies.""Nearly 90% of our capacity and operations are from US ports which are covered under the reporting requirements of the CVSSA,"" the statement from Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen reads. ""Many of our US competitors sail from Europe and other non-US ports so they are not mandated to submit CVSSA data as part of the reporting process. Royal Caribbean didn't immediately reply to CNN's request for comment.The DOT chart includes figures for other alleged crimes, missing US citizens and suspicious deaths. The department issues the summaries quarterly. While the numbers for the same time period were up 67%, the increase from the second quarter of 2019 to the third was 35%.An industry trade group, the Cruise Lines International Association, said the DOT report ""shows that allegations of serious crime onboard cruise ships remain extremely rare, especially compared to crimes that occur on land.""The group also asserted the CVSSA subjects the cruise industry to strict reporting standards that don't apply to other businesses in the travel and tourism sector.""Combined with the cruise industry's commitment to providing the best possible experiences to their passengers, these factors create a powerful incentive for cruise lines to both adopt and implement policies meant to protect those onboard,"" the trade group said.CNN's Alec Snyder and Jason Hanna contributed to this report."
An Ecuadorian immigrant was killed in the Jersey City shooting,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/jersey-city-victim-douglas-miguel-rodriguez/index.html,"Rodriguez, 49, died when two people opened fire Tuesday at the kosher supermarket where he worked for the past year and a half, doing everything from handling the register to restocking challah, the traditional Jewish braided bread.Rodriguez, known to his family and friends as Miguel, was a commercial engineer in his native Ecuador. He moved to the United States about four years ago after he was laid off from his job at an insurance company and he couldn't find another job, hoping to build a better life for his wife and young daughter.""My brother was an extraordinary man, kind, hardworking and always willing to serve others,"" his sister Ketty Rodriguez told CNN. While he was not Jewish, Rodriguez was a very Christian man who admired those who were faithful no matter their religion or beliefs, his sister said. Some of his friends, who are Jewish, recommended him for the job at the store.Family members in Ecuador and the US started worrying about Rodriguez when he stopped answering their calls and text messages about noon.When they started seeing the news of the shooting, his wife went to the scene but couldn't get any information about Rodriguez, his sister said. It was until several hours into the night that police confirmed Rodriguez's death to his wife, and she called the rest of the family in Ecuador.""He was a gentleman, a loving father and husband, a son and a brother,"" Ketty Rodriguez said of her brother.Rodriguez was killed along with Mindy Ferencz, 31, who owned the store along with her husband, and Moshe Deutsch, 24, who was a customer. A 40-year-old Jersey City police detective, Joseph Seals, was killed while attempting to stop the shooters.Rabbi David Niederman of the Brooklyn-based United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg called Rodriguez a hero. ""After being shot, he (Rodriguez) opened the back door for a customer to be rescued and unfortunately, he died at the footstep of that door,"" Niederman told reporters on Thursday.Authorities have not discussed Rodriguez's actions and CNN has not independently verified Niederman's account.Rodriguez was survived by his wife and an 11-year-old daughter who lived with him in the US as well as his mother, several siblings and extended family in Ecuador, according to his family and the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn.""He was butchered brutally while working in the store and providing for his family. May he rest in peace,"" the UJO said.His family has decided to repatriate Rodriguez's remains to his hometown of Guayaquil, the consul general of Ecuador in New Jersey said in a statement.A funeral for Rodriguez will be held Sunday in New Jersey before the repatriation of his remains, Ecuadorian officials said.

A winning lottery ticket for $14.6 million just went unclaimed,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/unclaimed-lottery-ticket-14-6-million-trnd/index.html," (CNN)Someone won a $14.6 million lottery jackpot in Arizona. That would be really exciting -- if they had claimed it.Tickets expire after 180 days. The winning ticket was sold June 5 in Goodyear, Arizona, meaning the lucky ticket holder had until December 2 at 5 p.m. to claim the prize.But that deadline came and went. No one showed up to claim his or her prize. It's the largest prize ever in Arizona to go unclaimed. ""To claim any prize of $600 or more, a winner needs to sign the back of their ticket and come to one of the Arizona Lottery's offices,"" Arizona Lottery public information officer John Gilliland told CNN on Tuesday. ""There is nothing more exciting for Arizona Lottery than to award a large jackpot, like this $14.6 million prize, so we are always a little sad when we see one of these prizes expire unclaimed,"" Gregg Edgar, executive director of the Arizona Lottery, said in a statement.It's not all that uncommon for a winning lottery ticket to go unclaimed, but the prize is usually much less than $14.6 million.There were $2.89 billion in unclaimed lottery prizes in the 12 months ending June 2017, lottery expert Brett Jacobson told CNN in 2018. And 167 prizes worth $1 million or more went unclaimed in fiscal 2017. The biggest-ever unclaimed prize was a $77 million winning ticket purchased in Georgia in June 2011.Up until Monday, the largest unclaimed prize in Arizona had been a $4 million jackpot back in 1999. In fiscal year 2019, Arizona Lottery saw more than $11.6 million go unclaimed, Gilliland said.Where that money goes is up to the state. In Arizona, about 30% goes to Court Appointed Special Advocates, a program where volunteers are appointed by a judge to speak on behalf of abused and neglected children in court. Up to $250,000 goes to a program that gives thousands of Native American high school students the opportunity to take college courses for both high school and college credit, and up to $835,000 goes to the Internet Crimes Against Children task force to locate, prosecute and imprison people who sexually exploit children.The rest of the unclaimed prize money is used to fund prizes for new games and second-chance drawings.""These dollars will be utilized now to enhance our player's experiences with future games and fund a variety of beneficiaries that have tremendous impact for our community,"" Edgar said.

The powerful winter storm that trekked across the country and ruined many travel plans is leaving New England.The storm is moving Tuesday toward the Atlantic Ocean, but its outer bands will dump a final round of snow and an icy wintry mix throughout the day, CNN meteorologist Rob Shackelford said. Parts of Massachusetts could see another 4 to 8 inches of snow Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.But snow isn't what residents should worry about, Shackelford said. ""Slush is the problem."" Now, drivers from New Jersey to Boston face treacherous travel conditions.Meantime on the other side of the country, a storm that's deluged Northern California will begin to head east. And the West Coast is likely to get hit later this week with another storm. Watch out for slippery roads in New EnglandIn a little over 24 hours, parts of New England saw snowfall rates ranging from 3 to a whopping 20 inches -- that number coming from Hampshire County, Massachusetts. The governors of New York and Massachusetts urged residents stay home if they could.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked drivers to stay off the roads after a bus crash Monday evening left nearly 30 passengers injured.""For those who have to travel, take extreme caution on the roadways as our crews work 'round the clock to clear the snow and ice,"" Cuomo said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker warned drivers to build in extra time Tuesday if they're driving in the eastern part of the state or to consider taking public transportation.""Plan on slippery road conditions,"" the National Weather Service's Boston office said. ""If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.""In Connecticut, authorities since Sunday responded to at least 270 accidents, including 21 with injuries, State Police Trooper First Class Christine Jeltema said.

Forecasters say another storm could hit California on Friday and Saturday. This one could be larger, bringing more heavy rain and mountain snow. But here's the good news: That storm will bring much needed rain to Southern California, Hennen said, with Los Angeles expecting 1 to 2 inches of rain.

A luxury developer hung a $4.8 million chandelier above a former homeless encampment in Vancouver,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/vancouver-chandelier-4-8-million-trnd/index.html," (CNN)There's a $4.8-million piece of public art hanging underneath a Vancouver, Canada, bridge, and residents say it's distastefully positioned in an area formerly frequented by homeless people. The Spinning Chandelier, designed by artist Rodney Graham, is and does what its title suggests: The 14-by-21-foot faux-crystal chandelier swivels rapidly, rising and falling over the course of 24 hours.  It's certainly a spectacle, but some passersby weren't sold on it when asked by CNN news partner CBC. ""The price tag is way too high for what it is,"" retired artist Janice Rafael told CBC. Head of public art for the City of Vancouver, Eric Frederickson, said he is bracing for criticism lobbed at the piece, but it should increase tourism to the ""rough and functional space."" ""For the artist, I think he was thinking more abstractly about the sculpture and the light possibilities in the chandelier,"" he told CBC. ""I'm not sure how much the social implications are in there."" The city didn't fund the chandelier; that was up to luxury property developer Westbank. City officials required Westbank to create a public art piece as part of its deal to build Vancouver House, a new 59-story mixed-use building, CBC reported. The New York Times reported the project cost $575 million, so the chandelier is fittingly luxe. Homelessness in Vancouver on the riseBefore construction on the project began, the area was industrial, and the Granville bridge was known to shelter homeless people, CBC reported. Vancouver's homeless population reached more than 2,220 people this year, the highest it's been since the city's homeless count started in 2002. That amount is only a fraction of the the 60,000-plus people who are homeless in Los Angeles and even the 8,700 homeless people in Toronto, but it's concerning because the city doesn't know why these numbers have grown. Experts have pointed to shrinking affordable housing. Westbank refuted criticism and said arts funding doesn't need to come at the expense of social causes. ""There is a pervasive attitude in our city that we must choose between contributing to social infrastructure or making other contributions, whether artistic or cultural, that are seen as less functional,"" the developer said in a statement to CBC. ""Westbank does not view this as an 'either/or' situation.""  "
Ex-wife of NJ shooter says earlier life showed no signs of later violence and extremism,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/ex-wife-nj-shooter-david-anderson-invs/index.html,"He wanted to talk with Kathleen about an individual she hadn't spoken with since 2003: her ex-husband, David Anderson, the suspected 47-year-old gunman in a deadly shooting on Tuesday that authorities believe targeted Jewish people in a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey.Kathleen, who asked that her last name not be used out of concern for her safety, said this came as a shock.""That was not the David I knew,"" she told CNN, speaking by phone Wednesday evening. Kathleen said the David Anderson she married in 2000 was outgoing, attentive and funny — not the David Anderson who, along with 50-year-old accomplice Francine Graham, killed four people and wounded a bystander in the hours-long firefight, according to police. Anderson and Graham were killed died in the gun battle.At a news conference Thursday, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal told reporters that both Anderson and Graham expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, but authorities have not found any definitive formal links between them and that organization or other groups. Authorities believe the shooters acted on their own, but were motivated by hate, and are investigating the crime as an act of domestic terrorism.""Based on what we have collected so far however, including based on recent witness interviews, we believe that the suspects held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people, as well as a hatred of law enforcement,"" Grewal said.Kathleen and Anderson met while stationed together in Germany with the US Army. Her description of their time together is remarkable for its normalcy — a stark contrast from the violence and criminal activity that characterized his later years. Ex-wife says Anderson 'wasn't a flashy person'Kathleen said Anderson was never violent in her presence.But a 2009 police report years later details a domestic-violence incident in which Anderson allegedly threatened to kill his then-girlfriend. In addition, there were two other cases, in 2003 and 2007, where Anderson was arrested for unlawful possession of weapons. In both cases, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to jail, according to court records obtained by CNN.Kathleen divorced him after her 2003 discharge and returned to Georgia while he remained in Germany — a move she attributed in part to the ocean between them, but also to an increased emotional distance. They did not have children.Kathleen was about 22 and Anderson about 28 when they met on the base in 2000.""I thought he was a nice-looking guy,"" she said. ""He made me laugh.""They both served in the same maintenance unit at the Babenhausen base near Frankfurt. She was an electronics technician and he worked in the same building as a fuel and electrical system repairer, according to Army public affairs at the Pentagon, which confirmed that Anderson served from September 1999 to September 2003.""They dealt with a lot of chemicals, the battery acid,"" said Kathleen, who is currently a stay-at-home mother with children from a later marriage. ""You had to have like a suit and mask.""Kathleen and Anderson eloped at a German courthouse after a couple months of dating. They moved into an apartment, where Anderson set up a recording studio and self-produced hip-hop songs. Though Kathleen said she cannot recall what the songs were about, she remembers what they not about ""money or fancy cars,"" or ""anything questionable.""""I know what kind of a person I am. I wouldn't have felt comfortable with him rapping about anything negative,"" she said. ""He wasn't a flashy person ... If anything (the lyrics) just had to do with just life, just him growing up in Jersey.""  Anderson looked up to his father, a musician who raised Anderson after Anderson's mother died when he was just a boy, Kathleen said.Although Kathleen does not remember Anderson ever espousing extreme views about Jews or other races or religions, she said he was a religious young man who often carried around a Bible.""He would just sit around (the apartment) and read it,"" she said. ""He wasn't like a Bible pusher.""For fun, they went to movies, ate with friends and attended frequent German festivals, complete with bratwurst, schnitzel and beer.Kathleen returned to her home in Georgia in early 2003. Anderson planned to join her after his stint. They talked on the phone, but she remembers their relationship started to ""kind of go distant. I know for me; I can't say for him. He really didn't want the divorce, but I did.""After the divorce, she said, he moved back to New Jersey. He reached out to her once by phone in 2003.""He was just checking to see how I was doing,"" she said.Arrested three times after return from GermanyWhen Anderson came back from Germany in 2003, police and court records paint a picture of a different life. That same year Anderson was arrested in New Jersey for possession of weapons ""with purpose to use it unlawfully against a person or property of another,"" according to court records, and was sentenced to 11 months in jail.Four years later in 2007, he was arrested again in Ohio, this time for the possession of a weapon. He received a 14-month jail sentence. In September 2009, he was arrested in a domestic violence incident in Kent, Ohio, during which he told his girlfriend, ""I'm gonna kill you. I feel like killing you,"" according to the police report. He pleaded guilty to criminal mischief but not to domestic violence and was ordered to pay a $250 fine and complete 16 hours of community service, according to court records.Sometimes in recent years Kathleen would type his name into social-media search engines on a whim. But the searches always served up a bevy of David Andersons — none of them him — and she would let it go.CNN found an Instagram account which appears to belong to Anderson where he posts about his music and running a mobile store out of a van because he couldn't get a job as a felon. The most recent post from January 2015 is captioned ""Revelations 1:13-15 Jesus comes from the tribe of JUDAH!!!!!!!!!!!! Y'all n***** better wake the f*** up before its too late. America has NOTHING for us but DEATH.""  On one Facebook page that is thought to belong to Anderson, under the name Dawada Maqabath, the author's ""info"" said ""Tool of TMH."" ""TMH"" can refer to God, or ""The Most High."" The Black Hebrew Israelite movement is best known for its confrontational brand of street preaching in urban areas, but it has a complex history in the United States, with sects and branches splintering over theological and leadership disputes. Scholars say what unites most Black Israelites is the belief that blacks are the true descendants of biblical Jews. Some members have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the past. However, the Southern Poverty Law Center does not recognize the overall movement as a hate group.Authorities were checking into a note found in the stolen U-Haul truck used by the shooters that contained both anti-Semitic and anti-police writing, a law enforcement source told CNN.Posts with similar sentiments have been found on social media linked to the shooters, the source said.Kathleen says she never saw those posts. As the years went by, Anderson faded from her daily concerns, though she would fleetingly think of him when she read anything about New Jersey. She vaguely thought of him on Tuesday, when reading the news about the shooting in Jersey City.But she says she had no idea her ex-husband had been involved until Wednesday, when the FBI agent showed up in her driveway and spoke to her while she was still clutching bags filled with Christmas presents.When the agent told Kathleen that Anderson was one of the suspected shooters, she was stunned -- not only by his involvement, but also by a simultaneous realization.""He was killed,"" she remembers telling the agent, who nodded.""So that — that hurt too,"" she told CNN. ""It was hurtful all the way around. I hate that — how his life ended. Or that's a place in his mind that he was at. I guess that's the troubling part for me. Because I'm still in shock from just knowing that it was him."""

Chicago Police infiltrated secret online groups selling guns and drugs in 'Operation FaceBOOKED',https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/chicago-facebook-arrests/index.html," (CNN)Chicago Police said Tuesday that 53 people are in custody as part of ""Operation FaceBOOKED,"" a two-year operation to infiltrate secret groups selling drugs and guns on Facebook.Interim superintendent Charlie Beck announced the mass arrests at a news conference Tuesday and took aim at Facebook's privacy policies, which he said facilitated the practice.""Today's announcement will help educate everyone on how some of these dangerous weapons are being sold, and how social media conglomerates like Facebook are encouraging this type of illegal activity by turning a blind eye in the name of member privacy,"" he said.The investigation began in December 2017 when an informant told police drugs and weapons were regularly sold on these private groups on Facebook, according to First Deputy Superintendent Anthony Riccio. The private groups are unsearchable, effectively making them invisible to anyone not invited in, he explained.""Facebook claims to monitor these groups but CPD detectives have labeled these private hidden sites as a version of the dark web that is more accessible to everyday users,"" Riccio said.Sixty-five people were targeted and identified in the operation, and of those, 53 are in custody and two have active arrest warrants as a result of the investigation. Police recovered seven weapons -- four handguns, two shotguns and a high-powered rifle -- totaling about $4,100 and 23 types of narcotics totaling about $105,000, Riccio said.Facebook says on its site that the sale or trade of firearms between individuals is not allowed.""Illicit drug and firearms sales have no place on our platform. We remove content and accounts that violate our policy and catch over 97% of drug sale content and over 93% of the firearms sales content we remove before it is reported to us,"" said Sarah Pollack, a Facebook spokeswoman.""We've had productive conversations with Mayor (Lori) Lightfoot's office about promoting public safety in Chicago and look forward to continuing them. We remain ready to quickly respond to valid legal process from the Chicago Police Department in order to prosecute those who break the law and refer any matters involving credible threats to prevent harm.""One of the men arrested Monday was arrested in 2017 in a previous Chicago Police investigation of Facebook, Riccio said. He said Facebook has agreed to shut down the groups but refuses to block the individual members.""Facebook often cites privacy concerns when they're confronted with the facts of our investigation,"" he said. ""The truth is, Facebook is harboring criminals. These criminals know how to use the privacy Facebook affords them, and they profit from the sale of drugs and dangerous guns.""In addition, Chicago Police slammed the social media giant for banning undercover police profiles with false information. Under its authenticity policy, Facebook says fake accounts are not allowed.""I think that Facebook needs to recognize that all of us have an obligation to keep each other safe,"" Beck, the interim superintendent, said.

Fourth teenager who escaped from a Nashville detention center is in custody,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/fourth-teen-nashville-escapee-recaptured/index.html,"A tip provided through Crime Stoppers helped lead authorities to 17-year-old Brandon Caruthers, who was recaptured in a suburban Nashville apartment, the Metro Nashville Police Department said. Police posted a photo of what appeared to be an AR-15-style rifle and boxes of ammunition that police confiscated from the apartment. An adult male and an adult woman who were in the apartment with Caruthers were taken into custody, police said. Caruthers is charged as an adult in an armed robbery case last year. Security videos showed the teenagers, two of whom are accused of murder, running undetected through the empty hallways of the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Facility and escaping through the front door on November 30. Officials said the four escaped because of critical oversights by the company that managed the facility.Decorrius Wright, 16, and Calvin Howse, 15, were recaptured on December 3. Morris Marsh, 17, was taken into custody on December 6 after a vehicle pursuit, police said.

California utility PG&E to pay $13.5 billion to settle claims from wildfire victims,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/us/pge-settlement/index.html," (CNN)California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric has agreed to pay $13.5 billion to individuals affected by several recent fires in the state, the company announced Friday night.The agreement still has to be approved by a bankruptcy court. PG&E has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which allows for restructuring.The claims stem from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 Northern California fires, the 2018 Camp Fire, as well as the fire at Oakland's Ghost Ship warehouse in 2016. ""From the beginning of the Chapter 11 process, getting wildfire victims fairly compensated, especially the individuals, has been our primary goal,"" CEO and PG&E President Bill Johnson said. ""We want to help our customers, our neighbors and our friends in those impacted areas recover and rebuild after these tragic wildfires.""PG&E has previously settled claims with insurance companies for $11 billion and local governments for $1 billion.Equipment linked to deadly firesThe company has been criticized for the role its equipment has played in the outbreak of numerous fires in California, among them the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history. An investigation by the California Public Utilities Commission's Safety and Enforcement Division (SED) concluded that the company's equipment helped lead to last November's Camp Fire, which killed 85 people. The report pointed specifically to inadequate maintenance and inspection of transmission line towers. PG&E conceded that a part separated from a transmission-line tower, likely starting the fire in dry vegetation near the town of Pulga. Inspections would have identified wear that would have warranted a close climbing inspection, the report said, but PG&E's records do not show a climbing inspection of that tower in at least 17 years.""We remain deeply sorry about the role our equipment had in this tragedy, and we apologize to all those impacted by the devastating Camp Fire,"" the company said in a statement responding to the report. ""PG&E's most important responsibility must always be public and employee safety, and we remain focused on helping affected communities recover and rebuild, resolving wildfire victims' claims fairly and expeditiously, and further reducing wildfire risks.""Recently, PG&E has tried to avoid causing fires by cutting power to its customers during particularly dry and windy periods.Fires push company to bankruptcyPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January to shed some of its debt and pay for damages and stay in business. The company cited at least $7 billion in claims from the Camp Fire.If the utility does not pull itself out of bankruptcy, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state would take over.""PG&E as we know it may or may not be able to figure this out. If they cannot, we are not going to sit around and be passive,"" Newsom said. ""If Pacific Gas and Electric is unable to secure its own fate and future ... then the state will prepare itself as backup for a scenario where we do that job for them.""Newsom said that his office aims to get the company out of bankruptcy by June 30, 2020 by first working on a plan with PG&E and other stakeholders, but added that the company could not continue without making changes to its safety culture."
"A Pennsylvania mother said her children, age 8 and 4, killed themselves. Now she's charged with murder",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/pennsylvania-mother-murder-charges-children-hanging/index.html," (CNN)When first responders arrived at Lisa Snyder's home in Pennsylvania on September 23, they found a horrific scene.Snyder's 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter were in the basement, hanging by their necks from a support beam, a probable cause affidavit filed with the court said. The children were in cardiac arrest and died a few days later, the affidavit said.Snyder told investigators that she thought the children killed themselves, the affidavit said. Her son was bullied at school and had talked about taking his life, his mother told troopers, and he told her he didn't want to die alone. But that story was a lie, prosecutors say. Investigators found no evidence that the boy was being bullied. On Monday, more than two months after the children died, Snyder, 36, was arrested and charged with murdering Conner and Brinley. Snyder's attorney, Dennis Charles, declined to comment when reached Monday by phone. ""My policy has always been not to discuss active cases with the media,"" he said. Berks County District Attorney John Adams said at a news conference that Snyder continues to maintain the children killed themselves.He described investigators' findings but offered no motive.""I don't know that there's any explanation for her behavior at all. I don't think that I can stand up here nor can anyone explain the horrific loss of two innocent children's lives,"" Adams said. Snyder was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of endangering the welfare of children, two counts of third-degree murder, tampering with/fabricating physical evidence, cruelty to animals and sexual intercourse with an animal.She's being held without bond in the Berks County Prison.'He tells me he hates school' Snyder and her children lived in Albany Township, about 75 miles northwest of Philadelphia. She told investigators that children made fun of Conner ""because he is fat,"" and he was starving himself, the affidavit said. ""He tells me he hates school, every day he tells me he doesn't want to talk about school,"" Snyder told investigators.She told investigators that she sat down with her son the week before his body was found and encouraged him to come to her, ""if you ever feel like hurting yourself."" ""He did say to me when we were talking, I woulda killed myself already but I am scared to go by myself,"" Snyder said, according to the affidavit.Adams, the prosecutor, said Snyder ordered the dog lead the children were hanging from September 22 and picked it up from a store the morning of September 23. On that day, Snyder told investigators, Conner asked to build a fort in the basement when he got home from school. She told investigators that her son took two dining room chairs downstairs, along with the dog lead, and asked his sister to come play with him, the affidavit said. While the kids were in the basement, Snyder said, she put away laundry, went outside to play with the dog and smoke a cigarette, and then went downstairs to ask if the children wanted frozen pizza or Chef Boyardee for dinner, the affidavit said. First responders found the children hanging from the beam, about three feet apart, the affidavit said. The two bar-height dining room chairs were knocked onto their sides, the affidavit said. Snyder told investigators she tried to lift Brinley, who weighed 40 pounds, but she couldn't work the ""latch"" on the dog lead, the affidavit said. She said she couldn't lift the 151-pound Conner, either, the affidavit said. ""She then went upstairs and called 911 and never returned back to the basement,"" the affidavit said.The children died three days later.  Early suspicions Adams said investigators had questions right away.""Eight year-olds, generally, that I am aware, do not commit suicide,"" Adams said.School officials and family members said Conner never mentioned he was suicidal or being bullied, the affidavit said. Others, including a witness who lived in Snyder's home, said Conner never told them he was a victim of bullying, the document said. A security video of Conner getting off the bus on the day his body was discovered showed no signs of distress, it said. ""In fact from the video, he appeared to be a happy child,"" Adams said. Adams did not identify the witness who lived in the home, but said that Snyder's 17-year-old son lived there. The witness said the younger children rarely played in the basement, Adams said. Adams said the Berks County Children and Youth Services had previously been involved with the family.Adams said children were removed from the home in 2014, but he didn't specify which children. They were returned to her care in February 2015, Adams said. He did not say why the children were removed.The agency was involved with the family until November 2015, he said. ""As far as we can tell, from the evidence that we have reviewed, they made what appeared to be the proper decisions at the time,"" Adams said.In an email Tuesday, agency administrator Krista McIlhaney declined to comment on the case. She said the ""the agency does not remove or return children, the courts make those decisions in a court proceeding."" 'Hits us in the heart'The affidavit said three weeks before her children died, Snyder told a witness she was depressed and couldn't get out of bed.She also ""made a statement that she does not care anymore about her kids,"" the affidavit said. In the days before her children's deaths, Snyder's Gmail account made several online searches that drew investigators' interest. In one instance, her account looked up ""carbon monoxide in a car how long to die,"" the affidavit said. Google searches on her account showed a search on a website that described an effective way to hang someone with using a simple suspension, the affidavit said. The district attorney said the case has been an emotional one for investigators. ""Anytime that any of us have to investigate, prosecute cases that involve the abuse or death of an innocent child, it all hits us in the heart,"" he said. Conner's and Brinley's deaths have made authorities ""appreciate the quality of life and the value of human life,"" Adams said. ""It's just not right, and it's not fair,"" he said."
He'll be the first federal prisoner executed in 17 years. His victims' relatives don't want that,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/us/death-penalty-family-plea-daniel-lewis-lee/index.html,"Russellville, Arkansas  (CNN)The family of Daniel Lewis Lee's victims were packing bags and planning an hours-long drive to Indiana last week as prison officials there prepared for the first federal execution in nearly 17 years.Lee, a onetime white supremacist convicted in a triple murder, was scheduled to be put to death this past Monday, and relatives of the young family he killed had arranged to travel up from rural Arkansas where the grisly crime occurred to bear witness. After all, when Attorney General William Barr announced this summer that the Trump administration would revive the use of capital punishment at the national level, he attributed it to a debt owed by the Justice Department ""to the victims and their families.""But Earlene Peterson -- the 80-year-old matriarch of the family, whose daughter, granddaughter and son-in-law were tortured, killed, and dumped in a lake by Lee and his accomplice -- did not want it done in her name.""It would shame my daughter,"" Peterson said in an interview, ""that someone has to die for her.""Lee's execution was not carried out on Monday as planned. As the prison was going through its final motions, a court in Washington blocked the death sentence from being carried out.The Justice Department challenged the ruling up to the Supreme Court. But on Friday, the government lost there, too, delaying the execution of Lee and three other men for at least several more weeks as federal judges consider whether a new lethal injection protocol proposed by the government passes legal muster.That's allowed Peterson to continue her unusual fight to save the life of the man who killed her daughter, granddaughter and son-in-law.It's also an unusual message for Peterson to deliver: she is a Trump supporter asking the President to go against his tough-on-crime gut.  ""For one time in your life, lean to your better self and know that this is wrong. And I don't want this done,"" Peterson said.Peterson is not alone in that sentiment. Both the lead government prosecutor and the trial judge who presided over the case have since said that Lee's death penalty is unjust. Lee and another man, Chevie Kehoe, were convicted in 1999 in a plot to steal guns and money to help fund a white ethno-state in the Pacific Northwest.Prosecutors said that to further their cause, they robbed and murdered William Mueller, a gunsmith with cash and weapons in his house, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah. The family's bodies were found weighed down and tossed in an Arkansas bayou. The three had been shot with a stun gun, bound and suffocated with plastic bags over their heads secured with tape. After the men were convicted, a penalty trial began, with the jury deciding first that Kehoe, who had been described as the ringleader of the crime, should receive only life in prison without parole. At that point, prosecutors in Arkansas had intended to argue for the same sentence for Lee, but they were overruled by officials at the Justice Department in Washington and directed to seek the death penalty for Lee -- a sentence that the jury eventually handed down. It left Kimma Gurel, Peterson's remaining daughter who attended nearly all of the trial alongside her, with a sense that justice had been denied. ""There's no question in my mind that Daniel Lee is guilty. The part that's questioning is that the other man was more guilty and he got life without parole, so why did Daniel Lee get the death penalty? It didn't make sense,"" Gurel said. Lee's attorneys have since argued that prosecutors relied on discredited science to prove that he would be a psychopath in prison. They also argued prosecutors misled the jury about a prior murder falsely attributed to Lee when they sought to prove he'd be a danger in prison and should be put to death.Two federal judges in Arkansas that looked at the issues cast doubt on whether the jury would have returned a death sentence for Lee if the faulty evidence had not been included.But both judges' hands were tied to overturn the sentence because of procedural limitations. The latest salvo by Lee's legal team to dispute the merits of the death sentence was rejected by an appeals court last week. Ruth Friedman, the director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project -- an arm of the Federal Defender Program that represents Lee -- says she's never seen such a group come forward in opposition to an inmate's death. ""In whose interest is it to execute this man when you have the victims, the lead prosecutor in the case, the judge who tried the case and oversaw the proceedings that followed it -- they're all saying this should not go forward. In whose name is this going forward?"" Friedman asked. Since Lee entered death row, the government's concerns about his potential danger have not  played out, Friedman said. And Peterson said that she was told by nuns who visited with Lee that he has changed.Not everyone in the family agrees with her, but Peterson wants Lee to spend his life in prison instead of dying early.

Barnard student stabbed to death just blocks from Manhattan college,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/barnard-college-student-stabbing/index.html," (CNN)An 18-year-old student at Barnard College was stabbed to death just blocks from the Manhattan school in an armed robbery on Wednesday, Barnard College President Sian Leah Beilock said.There have been no arrests, but ""a couple"" of people are being questioned by police, NYPD Chief of Patrol Services Rodney Harrison said, stressing the investigation is still in its early stages. Those being questioned are minors, he said. The student, freshman Tessa Rane Majors, was walking through Morningside Park at 116th Street and Morningside Drive on Wednesday evening when police believe she was confronted by between one and three individuals, Harrison said. A struggle ensued and one of the individuals stabbed Majors with a knife several times. She staggered her way up to the ""surface side"" of Morningside Drive, he said, adding that she was found by a school security officer who called 911. She was taken to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. A knife was recovered but it's unclear if it's connected to Majors' murder, he said. ""I'm very confident ... that we're going to bring this individual to justice,"" Harrison said. A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation previously told CNN a witness who spoke to the NYPD said Majors was confronted by 4-5 men during an initial dispute in Morningside Park. Her cell phone was found a short distance away from where she was found, but she did not have a purse or wallet on her, the source said.Majors is believed to be a victim of one of two robbery patterns in the area, the source said.Pattern of crimesPolice officials and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio faced questions about the pattern of crimes in and around the park in Thursday's news conference. In response, Harrison said the NYPD had identified issues and implemented different strategies to combat the problem. The NYPD is stepping up patrols in and around the park and at the nearby schools, including Barnard. ""The idea that a college freshman at Barnard was murdered in cold blood is absolutely not only painful to me as a parent, it's terrifying to think that that could happen anywhere,"" de Blasio said at the news conference. ""It's unbelievable to me that that could happen here, next to one of our great college campuses,"" he added. ""It's an unacceptable reality.""The city has offered Barnard College any help it needs and it's sending mental health professionals to help students deal with the news, according to de Blasio.""This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core. Please know that we are all grieving together and I am thinking of you as we process this awful news as a community,"" said Beilock, the college's president, adding a reminder that Barnard's public safety department provides 24/7 escort service for students. 'A personality no one could ever copy'Majors' family is en route to New York City, Beilock said. ""Tessa was just beginning her journey at Barnard and in life. We mourn this devastating murder of an extraordinary young woman and member of our community,"" Beilock said.People who commented on Majors' Instagram page and spoke to CNN described her as a kind young woman and devoted musician.""She was one of the sweetest people I know. She had a kind heart,"" Lydia Pickering told CNN. As kids, she and Majors lived two houses down from one another in Waynesboro, Virginia, Pickering said. Majors was like an older sister, she told CNN. ""I can't even begin to explain the impact she had on me,"" Pickering said. ""She brought joy wherever she went. She had a personality no one could ever copy, she was really just special.""Lexi Phelan, who met Majors this year at Barnard, shared two classes with her.""Anyone who was lucky enough to meet her would agree that she was a good, kind person,"" Phelan said. ""Her personality put others at ease and she lit up any room she was in with her passion."" Barnard College is an all-women's school in Manhattan with more than 2,600 students. The school's campus stretches from west 116th Street to west 120th Street off Broadway in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of New York City.""The close-knit community at Barnard College is in shock right now,"" de Blasio said in a tweet.

2 of the 4 teens who escaped from a Nashville detention center have been found,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/nashville-teen-escapees/index.html," (CNN)Two teenagers who broke out of a Nashville juvenile detention center were recaptured Tuesday, police said. Decorrius Wright, 16, and Calvin Howse, 15, were taken in custody by the Juvenile Crime Task Force in Madison, Tennessee, the Metro Nashville Police Department tweeted.Authorities are still searching for the two other teens who escaped from the facility on Saturday. The arrests come hours after officials released security videos that showed the teens running undetected through the empty hallways of the facility and escaping through the front door.The videos released Tuesday by the Davidson County Juvenile Court show the teens -- Wright, Howse, Morris Marsh and Brandon Caruthers --  as they make their way outside the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center in downtown Nashville. Three were shown wearing bright yellow vests.The teens escaped the facility Saturday past the 9 p.m. usual bedtime when a staff supervisor left them cleaning an area inside the facility by themselves and went to a different floor to address a disturbance, the company managing the center said. They entered an elevator that had been left open by a staff member, according to a statement from Davidson County Juvenile Court. They were ""able to convince a staff member to make a call to Master Control and request that the elevator be sent to the basement, which is an unsecured area youth are not permitted to access.""The footage appears to begin moments after they exited an elevator that connects the secured area of the facility to a public area in the basement. The teens are seen racing up the stairs to the main level of the facility. One of them briefly ran down the hallway away from the stairs before turning around to follow the others. The group, still wearing their vests, continues running on empty hallways before they go through the glass front doors and down the front steps of the building. Video from a camera outside the building shows one of them taking off his yellow vest and tossing it near the front entrance.Authorities had said it was more than likely the teens had some assistance once they were outside but no one else other than the teens appears on the surveillance footage released Tuesday.Youth Opportunity Investments, a private detention contractor which has managed the center since 2015, has fired three of its employees and suspended one for three days in reaction to the escape, the company said.A teen is among state's most wanted fugitivesOne of the two teens who remains at large has been added to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations' most wanted list. Brandon Caruthers, 17, was placed on the list after he and three other teens fled. He is being charged as an adult in an armed robbery case from August last year, police said. ""He should be considered dangerous,"" a TBI's wanted flyer said.A reward up to $2,500 is being offered for information leading to Caruthers' arrest, according to the TBI. Two of them were accused of murder in separate cases earlier this year. Decorrius Wright, 16, is accused in the February death of Kyle Yorlets, police said. Yorlets was a Nashville musician who was shot and killed when a group of five minors robbed him of his wallet and he refused to hand over his keys.Morris Marsh, 17, is accused in the April killing of Charles Easley, police have said.The third teen, 15-year-old Calvin Howse, was arrested in November on charges of gun possession and auto theft, police said.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify three of the four teens were shown wearing bright yellow vests in the security videos.CNN's Natalie Anders contributed to this report.

Fate of man accused of brutally killing two Boston doctors is in jury's hands,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/boston-doctors-trial-monday/index.html," (CNN)The man accused of brutally killing two Boston doctors in their penthouse killed one doctor in self-defense and stole from the home but did not commit murder, his attorney said in closing arguments before a jury began deliberating the case Monday.Bampumim Teixeira, a 33-year-old who had worked as a concierge in the building, is accused of fatally stabbing 39-year-old Lina Bolanos and her 48-year-old fiancé Richard Field, both well-known anesthesiologists, and leaving them in pools of blood at their Boston penthouse in May 2017. He has pleaded not guilty.A day after the killings, Teixeira told police he was having an affair with Bolanos and killed Field in self-defense, according to a recording played in court. His defense team rested its case Friday without presenting any evidence, and Teixeira's account was contradicted by other evidence at trial.The clip of Teixeira's recording was part of the evidence the prosecution presented before resting its case last week. Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney John Pappas questioned more than a dozen witnesses during the trial, including the couple's family and friends, first responders and investigators.In closing arguments, defense attorney Steve Sack questioned the credibility and accuracy of the police investigation. He argued that Teixeira is not guilty of home invasion or kidnapping because Bolanos let him into the penthouse apartment. ""Sometimes the truth is the hardest thing to believe,"" Sack told the jury.But prosecutors countered that the evidence against him was ""overwhelming"" and ""damning"" and said his interview with police was ""imagined.""""We've gone beyond the preposterous. We're now existing in the theater of the absurd,"" Pappas said.Couple sustained injuries from being bound or cuffedPappas told the court during his opening statement Field's hands were bound behind his back and he, like Bolanos, was found in a pool of blood. On Thursday, medical examiner Richard Atkinson testified Bolanos had sustained 24 incised and sharp-force stab wounds. The autopsy showed Bolanos suffered multiple blunt force injuries, including significant injuries to her face and head, according to Atkinson. Field suffered a single fatal stab wound to the neck that severed his carotid artery, Atkinson said.The couple also sustained injuries consistent with being bound or cuffed, he testified. During cross-examination, the medical examiner said he was unable to determine who died first or the time of death. He said he could not tell what kind of knife was used.Teixeira said he was having an affair with one doctor Prosecutors claimed Teixeira briefly worked as a concierge for the building in which the doctors lived and during that time, became familiar with the building's layout. In the recording of his statement to police, Teixeira said he began having an affair with Bolanos around that time. On May 5, he said Field found him with Bolanos — and then stabbed his fiancée to death. ""He stabbed her right in front of me,"" said Teixeira, adding that he feared for his life. ""It was either me or him.""Teixeira told police he did not have sex with Bolanos that day but had in the past. He claimed Bolanos told him Field was abusive.""I'm not sorry,"" Teixeira said in the recording about killing Field. ""A jealous man is the worst thing ever ... What I saw with my eyes was crazy.""There has been no evidence presented to support the defendant's account, which has been contradicted by the evidence at trial. The victims tried to get help Before they died, friends of the couple and a 911 dispatcher testified the doctors tried alerting authorities. A chilling 911 call captured Bolanos' voice, according to testimony from her godmother. In the call, Bolanos' voice came out muffled. And when she was unable to respond to repeated questions, the operator said she was ""releasing the call"" and hung up, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.Field also tried to get help, calling 911 eight times, Boston police Sgt. Scott Mackie testified, according to CNN affiliate WHDH. His phone log showed the calls lasted no longer than two seconds, Mackie testified.The day of the killings, a friend of Field received text messages from him. Matthias Heidenreich testified he had received a series of texts from Field's phone which asked him to call 911 because an armed man was in the doctor's home. Under cross examination in the last days of trial, Boston police Sgt. Det. Michael Devane told Sack he couldn't be sure who had sent those texts at the time of the crime because Bolanos made a 911 call from the doctor's cell.A chilling message was scribbled on the wall When police arrived at the apartment, officers testified they found Teixeira inside and shot him, thinking he had a gun. On the walls of the penthouse, the words ""payback"" and ""he killed my wife,"" were written out in large letters, Boston police Sgt. Edward Meade testified, according to CNN affiliate WHDH.Meade said officers found photos that were crossed out and marked.Teixeira was arrested in the building's hallway, where he told police there were bodies inside the penthouse, Boston police Det. Sean Wallace testified.""Then he said, 'You guys are going to die.' Then he said, 'They killed my wife.' Then he mentioned something, and I heard the word 'sniper,''' the detective told the jury.In his statement to police, Teixeira said he told the officers, ""Kill me now.""He said he had ""no idea"" about writing found on a wall of the apartment.

Three men indicted for murder of key witness in Amber Guyger trial,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/amber-guyger-witness-murder/index.html," (CNN)Three men were indicted by a grand jury on capital murder charges Thursday for allegedly killing Joshua Brown, a key witness in the murder trial of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, according to court documents.Jacquerious Mitchell, Michael Mitchell and Thaddeous Green were indicted for the shooting death of Brown on October 4. The indictments say the three men attempted to rob him. Previously, Dallas Assistant Chief of Police Avery Moore said Brown was killed after an argument escalated with Green in the parking lot of Brown's apartment complex. Brown allegedly shot and wounded Jacquerious Mitchell, according to Moore. Green then shot Brown twice and took a backpack from Brown and the gun used to wound Mitchell.Brown's death came 10 days after he testified in the trial of Guyger, 31, who was convicted of murder for fatally shooting Botham Jean in his Dallas apartment in 2018. She argued that she mistakenly walked into the wrong apartment — she lived in the same building — and opened fire because she thought Jean was an intruder.Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison.Brown lived across the hall from Jean at Dallas' South Side Flats apartments last year when Guyger killed Jean. In court, he testified that he returned home to his fourth-floor apartment at nearly the same time Guyger walked into Jean's apartment, mistaking it for her own.Brown said he was down the hall when he heard the voices of two people who sounded like they were meeting by ""surprise."" Gunshots followed ""right after,"" Brown said.Soon after, Brown said, he saw Guyger leave Jean's apartment and enter the hallway. The officer was on the phone. She was ""crying, explaining what happened, what she thought happened, saying she came in to the wrong apartment,"" Brown testified.Brown had been shot beforeBrown had survived a shooting nearly a year before his death, his attorney Lee Merritt said.He was shot near a strip club in Dallas in November 2018, Merritt said. Nicholas Shaquan Diggs was killed in the shooting, Merritt told CNN. Both Brown and his family believed he was targeted in that shooting by someone he knew and had grown up with.""And he was concerned that that person might try to come back and finish the job,"" Merritt said, adding that the shooter in that case hasn't been arrested.Brown moved out of South Side Flats about three months after Jean was killed in September 2018, according to Merritt. He tried to keep a ""low profile intentionally until some of the heat from the shooting in November passed over,"" Merritt added.CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report."
Surveillance footage captured the moment shooters opened fire on a Jersey City kosher market,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/jersey-city-shooting-surveillance/index.html,"What followed was an hourslong standoff with police. By day's end, four people were dead, including three civilians inside the store and Jersey City Police Detective Joseph Seals at a nearby cemetery. The shooters, identified by authorities as 47-year-old David N. Anderson and 50-year-old Francine Graham, were also killed. One surveillance video was obtained by the Orthodox Jewish news site The Yeshiva World. A second video, which law enforcement shared with community leaders, was obtained by CNN. Each is less than a minute long.Here's a breakdown of the moment the shooters opened fire, according to the two surveillance videos.A rifle is raised on a city streetIt's 12:21 p.m. when the footage begins. Passersby walk up and down the sidewalk in front of the market. Some huddle under umbrellas, and a handful of people are gathered beneath an awning in front of a liquor store. Cars are parked along the street next to the sidewalk, and in the next lane, four cars wait at a stoplight.A U-Haul truck that authorities say was driven by Anderson pulls up and parks across the street from the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket. He and Graham have just killed Seals in the Bay View Cemetery, about a mile away, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal's office said in a news release. Almost immediately, Anderson gets out of the truck, leaving the driver's door ajar, the video shows. Graham exits the truck from the passenger side.Anderson takes several steps across the street toward the market and raises a rifle, according to Grewal's office.The shooters open fire and bystanders fleeThe video does not have sound, but seconds after Anderson gets out of the truck, bystanders duck and scatter.Anderson walks forward with his rifle aimed at the market as people run down the sidewalk away from apparent gunfire. Others run into the street, slipping between parked cars.The second surveillance video obtained by CNN includes sound. In this footage, filmed from a window above the market's doorway, a burst of gunfire erupts as Anderson appears at the top of the frame and walks toward the store. Gunshot after gunshot is heard as he advances.Graham follows behind Anderson as he steps up onto the sidewalk. She also has a rifle, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said.At the door to the market, Anderson stops and looks back at Graham.""The perpetrator stopped in front there, calmly opened the door with two long rifles -- him and the other perpetrator -- and begin firing from the street into the facility,"" Fulop said. Anderson then runs inside. Graham follows him and disappears from view. Neither would come out alive. One man escapes and a standoff unfoldsAs Graham steps inside, a couple people on the street and sidewalk glance toward the market.Gunshots continue to ring out after Anderson and Graham enter the store, according to the second video.Two or three seconds later, a man runs out of the market, fleeing gunfire. He escapes across the street. A car parked along the sidewalk pulls into traffic as the cars at the stoplight drive away. The man who escaped had been shot, authorities said Wednesday, without giving his name. ""The survivor was able to escape the store at the beginning of the incident,"" Grewal said. But three people couldn't get out. The store's co-owner, Mindy Ferencz, 31; Moshe Deutsch, a 24-year-old customer; and Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, a store employee, were killed inside, Grewal said.Police responded, and a standoff lasted through the afternoon. The shooters ultimately were found dead inside. Diving into why it happenedAuthorities have not determined a motive for the attack. But mayors of Jersey City and New York City believe it should be considered a hate crime. ""My sentiment is that it should be viewed as a hate crime,"" Fulop said Wednesday, adding, ""There's no question it was an attack on the Jewish community.""Investigators are examining a note found inside the U-Haul that contained anti-Semitic and anti-police writings, a law enforcement source told CNN. Similar sentiments were found on a social media account linked to the shooters, the source said.At least one shooter had ties to the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a law enforcement official. Some members of the movement have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the past."
"Jersey City shooters fueled by hatred of Jewish people and law enforcement, state attorney general says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/jersey-city-new-jersey-shooting-thursday/index.html," (CNN)This week's deadly kosher market attack and the killing of a detective in New Jersey are being investigated as acts of domestic terrorism ""fueled by both anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs,"" the state attorney general said Thursday.""We believe the suspects held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people, as well as a hatred of law enforcement,"" New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said, citing evidence and witness interviews.Investigators believe David N. Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, killed a police detective near a Jersey City cemetery and then stormed a nearby Jewish market Tuesday, shooting and killing three people there and starting an hourslong police standoff that ended with their deaths, authorities said.It's still not know why Anderson and Graham attacked the detective and the JC Kosher Supermarket in particular, Grewal said.But evidence points to these being ""acts of hate,"" Grewal said in a news conference in Jersey City. The FBI is investigating the shootings as ""domestic terrorism with a hate-crime bias slant to it,"" said Gregory Ehrie, special agent in charge for the FBI in Newark.Investigators think Anderson and Graham acted by themselves, Ehrie said.While both shooters have expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, neither appear to have established formal links to the movement, Grewal said. Grewal didn't specify evidence pointing to a hate crime, though he said social media accounts believed linked to the shooters ""espouse certain viewpoints."" Grewal and others stressed that once at the market, the shooters apparently fired only at people there, and at responding police officers, bypassing multiple opportunities to shoot others on the street.""They were clearly targeting that store. They were clearly targeting the Jersey City Police Department,"" US Attorney Craig Carpenito said, partly citing surveillance video.Investigators are checking killers' ties to a previous killing and anti-Semitic writingsAnderson and Graham also were suspects in the weekend killing of a livery driver near the neighboring New Jersey city of Bayonne, Grewal has said. That man died Saturday, local media outlets, including NJ.com, reported.Authorities haven't said what, if anything, links the weekend killing to Tuesday's shootings, other than investigators believe Anderson and Graham were behind them all.Investigators also checking a note found a stolen U-Haul truck that the killers parked across from the market -- a note that contained both anti-Semitic and anti-police writing, a law enforcement source told CNN.Posts with similar sentiments also have been found on social media linked to the shooters, the source said.""Our community has been terrorized once again by violent anti-Semitism,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. ""From Pittsburgh to Poway, and now to Jersey City, the disease that is anti-Semitism has clearly spread to epidemic proportions.""""But we will not be defeated, we will not stand down, we will not be intimidated,"" Greenblatt said. Shooters had lots of firepower and 'could have done more' had police not stopped themKilled Tuesday were Jersey City police Detective Joseph Seals and three people in the market: Mindy Ferencz, 31, the store's co-owner; Moshe Deutsch, 24, a customer; and Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, a store employee.One person who was inside the market was shot when Anderson and Graham opened fire, but he fled the store as the attackers shot at him, and survived, officials said.Investigators think all three slain victims in the store ""were shot ... within minutes of the shooters entering the store,"" Grewal said.Hundreds of ammunition shells have been recovered from the market scene, Grewal said.Grewal on Thursday gave this account of the attackers' weapons found in the store:• An AR-15-style weapon, which Anderson fired as he entered• A Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Graham carried into the store• A 9mm Ruger semiautomatic firearm• A 9mm Glock 17Inside the killers' stolen U-Haul across the street was a pipe bomb and a fifth gun -- a .22-caliber Ruger with a homemade silencer and a homemade device to catch shells, Grewal said.The U-Haul also had ""ballistic panels"" designed to resist damage, Grewal said.""But for the actions of (police), they (the attackers) could have done more,"" Grewal said.Graham bought the shotgun and the Ruger in Ohio in the spring of 2018, the attorney general said.Tracking the shooters from a cemetery to the marketBefore Anderson and Graham made their way to the kosher market, they are believed to have killed Seals near a city cemetery, authorities have said. Police have said Seals was trying to stop Anderson and Graham -- but they haven't said why he tried, or why Anderson and Graham killed him.A bystander called 911 to report Seals' body at the cemetery at 12:38 p.m., authorities said.By that time, Anderson and Graham already were attacking the market.Surveillance video shows Anderson parking a stolen U-Haul across the street from the JC Kosher Supermarket, about a mile from the cemetery, city officials say.The pair get out, and a man -- Anderson, police say -- walks directly toward the store, apparently ignoring several people on the sidewalk nearby, and starts firing a gun into it before entering. Graham follows, police say.Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop has cited this video -- appearing to show Anderson ignoring pedestrians and other businesses -- as evidence that he attacked the kosher store for specific reasons.""My sentiment is that it should be viewed as a hate crime,"" Fulop said Wednesday afternoon. ""There's no question it was an attack on the Jewish community.""Police arrived at the supermarket around 20 minutes after the attack began, starting a long shootout that left two police officers injured. Around 3:25 p.m., a police armored vehicle broke into the supermarket's entryway, and law enforcement soon found the bodies of the three victims and two attackers inside the store, Grewal said.Investigators checking shooter's connection to Black Hebrew Israelites and anti-Semitic notesA law enforcement official told the New York Times Wednesday that Anderson appears to have a connection with the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, but the extent is unclear.The Black Hebrew Israelite movement is best known for its confrontational brand of street preaching in urban areas but it has a complex history in the United States, with sects and branches splintering over theological and leadership disputes. Scholars say what unites most Black Israelites is the belief that African-Americans are the true descendants of biblical Jews.Some members have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in the past.Anderson served in the US Army Reserve from September 1999 to September 2003, the Army said, as a fuel and electrical system repairer.Funerals guarded by police and volunteersTwo of the four victims were laid to rest Wednesday night.In Jersey City, crowds of men in black hats surrounded Ferencz's casket in the Jersey City neighborhood of Greenville at the site of a synagogue under construction. Hundreds of women, separated from the men as per Orthodox Jewish tradition, were standing in the bitter cold sobbing.Ferencz owned the store with her husband, who was next door at the small synagogue at the time of the attack, according to Yossi Steinmetz who was there as well.When shots broke out, her husband desperately tried to call her and tell her to lock the doors to take cover, Steinmetz said. She didn't answer.At Deutsch's Brooklyn funeral, mourners spoke in Hebrew through tears as at least a dozen NYPD counterterrorism officers and nearly 100 ""Shomrim"" members -- Hebrew for guardians -- stood watch.Deutsch and Ferencz both had ties to the Jewish community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.""This is just an atrocity. Of course, we accept everything but this is more than we can handle,"" Deutsch's cousin, also named Moshe Deutsch, told CNN. ""The question is, is it a sign of hatred? Is it a sign that we are not safe in New York anymore?""CNN's Melanie Schuman, Alec Snyder, Alexandra Field, Rob Frehse, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Nicole Chavez and Julian Cummings contributed to this report."

Robert Chadwick told reporters. The shooter then killed himself, Chadwick said. A third civilian employee was wounded and is stable at a hospital, Chadwick added.Chadwick said the sailor took his life after opening fire near Shipyard Drydock 2, a maintenance area for nuclear submarines.Authorities have not released the identities of the victims or the shooter.The incident occurred at 2:30 p.m. HST (7:30 p.m. ET) at the Pearl Harbor Naval shipyard, officials tweeted on the base's verified Twitter account.About three hours later, Lydia Robertson, a US Navy spokesperson, said the scene was secured and the base had reopened. Both base security and Navy Investigative Services are conducting the investigation, she said.Several witnesses told CNN affiliate KGMB/KHNL that they heard gunshots. One man, who did not give his name, said he was at his desk when he heard loud pops.""I kind of recognized that as gunshots, I looked out the window (and) saw three people on the ground, I looked out in time to see the shooter, who I assume was a sailor because he was in uniform, point the gun at his head and shoot himself,"" the witness told KGMB/KHNL.The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu received one patient from the incident, Minna Sugimoto, a spokeswoman for The Queen's Health System, told CNN. There were no other details about the victims.The shooting occurred three days before commemorations of the Japanese attack that thrust the United States into World War II.The base houses Air Force and Navy units and the base population, as of 2015, was more than 66,000.

"In the span of 2 years, the Pensacola shooter went from flight student to committing an 'act of terror'",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/pensacola-navy-gunman-timeline/index.html," (CNN)Mohammed Alshamrani was supposed to finish his flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida in August 2020, according to the Department of Defense.He was killed in a shootout with police last week after he opened fire in a classroom building. Three sailors were killed and several others were wounded as a result of the shooting, officials said. The FBI is now treating last week's shooting as ""act of terror,"" but Alshamrani's motive remains unknown. A US defense official provided a timeline of Alshamrani's time in the US to CNN. Here's what we know: 2017: Arrives in TexasAlshamrani began his training in August 2017, when he arrived in Texas to attend a year of an American language course and general English training at Lackland Air Force Base, the defense official's timeline read. He was a second lieutenant in the Saudi air force, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Alshamrani was vetted before his entry into the pilot training program and nothing of concern was found, a law enforcement source told CNN. 2018: Arrives in Florida Alshamrani arrived in Florida on May 20 for pilot training at Naval Aviation Schools Command (NASC) in Pensacola, the timeline read. He was part of an ongoing US military program training members of foreign militaries, including Saudi Arabia's. There are currently 852 Saudis in the US for Defense Department security cooperation training, said Commanding Officer of NAS Pensacola Capt. Tim Kinsella. For the next year and a half, he took classes that covered aviation preparation, swimming qualifications and Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training, according to the timeline. October 2019: Takes student leave Alshamrani took ""student leave"" from October 17 to 23. It is not clear what he did during these six days, but he was in Pensacola and received temporary lodging allowance, according to the timeline. October 2019: Starts advanced training Alshamrani began advanced training in late October, and stayed in the program until the shooting. This advanced portion of the program saw Alshamrani training as a strike fighter undergraduate military flight officer (UMFO), according to the timeline. November 2019: Travels to New YorkAlshamrani and a small group of Saudi nationals also traveled to New York City over the Thanksgiving holiday, a law enforcement official told CNN. They visited several museums and Rockefeller Center, the source said, but authorities don't know why they traveled to the city. December 2019: Hosts a dinner partySome of the Saudi nationals on base with Alshamrani told officials he hosted a dinner party ahead of the attack at which the group watched mass shooting videos, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.It is not clear when the dinner party was held. December 2019: Carries out the attackThe shooting took place in a classroom building, authorities said. Alshamrani used a handgun and was killed after two deputies exchanged gunfire with him, according to officials.It is unclear how Alshamrani got a gun on base because weapons are not allowed, authorities said. Minutes before authorities were alerted to the attack, a Twitter account aligning with the shooter's name posted a message inspired by al-Qaeda and its founder, Osama bin Laden, CNN's Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank wrote.The message, addressed to the American people, declared hate for Americans because of their ""crimes"" against Muslims. It made no reference to an impending attack. Instead, it repurposed words used by bin Laden and the American al Qaeda terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.CNN's  Steve Almasy, Christina Maxouris and David Shortell contributed to this report. "
Colorado high school evacuated after school safety app reveals bomb threat,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/us/safe2tell-colorado-evacuation-trnd/index.html," (CNN)A school in Colorado was evacuated Tuesday after authorities learned of a bomb threat through the Safe2Tell app.After the Columbine shooting in 1999, Colorado worked to develop the Safe2Tell Colorado tip line, where anyone can report threats against schools. The tip line's mobile app is what helped to keep Niwot High School safe on Tuesday.  ""We received Safe2Tell Reports concerning a bomb threat at Niwot HS,"" the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter.  ""All students and staff are safe, however, out of an abundance of caution, we have evacuated Niwot HS and will be assisting with reunification. We are working very closely with St. Vrain Valley Schools to investigate this threat.""  What is Safe2Tell Colorado?The idea of the app is to provide a truly anonymous space where anyone can submit tips regarding violence in Colorado schools, Lawrence Pacheco, director of communications for the Colorado Attorney General's Office, explained to CNN. The threats are set up in categories and last year the top ones were drugs, bullying and suicide.  ""It's been a successful program in reducing violence... and threats towards the school,"" Pacheco said. ""Since the inception of the program we have had over 65,000 tips reported.""  Safe2Tell Colorado was able to get both laws and procedures in place to guarantee the anonymity of every reporter and the tips have been monitored by the state attorney general's office since 2014.  Last year, the program saw a record number of reports and had over 19,000 actionable tips.  ""It will continue to grow as students are empowered to break the code of silence and share information that will lead to intervening or curtailing violence at their school,"" Pacheco said.  The program has gotten national attention and other states are looking to adopt their own models. "
North Korea's UN ambassador says denuclearization is off the table in talks with US,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/07/us/north-korea-denuclearization-off-table/index.html," (CNN)Denuclearization is off the table in negotiations with the United States, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations said in a statement Saturday. In the statement, the ambassador, Kim Song, said the United States' pursuit of ""sustained and substantial dialogue"" was a ""time-saving trick"" to benefit a ""domestic political agenda."" ""We do not need to have lengthy talks with the US now and the denuclearization is already gone out of the negotiation table,"" he said. CNN is reaching out to the State Department, the White House and the National Security Council for comment.Kim's comments also referred to a joint statement released Wednesday in which six EU nations condemned North Korea's short-range missile tests on November 28. Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Poland and the UK said they were ""deeply concerned by the continued testing of ballistic missiles,"" saying they undermined regional stability. ""As these six EU member states are making much trouble to play the role of pet dog of the United States in recent months, one cannot but wonder what do they get in return for currying favour with the United States,"" Kim, the ambassador, said.Saturday's statement comes as North Korea inches closer to its self-imposed end-of-year deadline for nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration and just days after a North Korean official ominously warned of a ""Christmas gift"" to the US. According to South Korea's Presidential Blue House, President Moon Jae-in and President Donald Trump discussed the situation on the Korean peninsula in a phone call on Friday night. Both agreed, the Blue House said in a statement, that a dialogue needed to continue in order to achieve denuclearization.CNN's Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report."

Della Jette and Sterling Jette Jr. were transported to Waterbury Hospital where they both were pronounced dead shortly after arrival, according to a news release from the Watertown Police Department. Their mother, identified by CNN affiliate WTNH as  Danielle Jette, was on the scene when the shootings occurred and called 911, police said. She was not injured.Paul W. Ferguson, 42, was pronounced dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said in the news release.He had moved into the home two weeks before the incident, police said.The argument began after Della Jette grew upset by Ferguson smoking in the house, Watertown Police detective and spokesman Mark Conway told CNN. Ferguson then retrieved a handgun from his bedroom and shot Sterling Jette -- who had attempted to intervene -- in the leg, Watertown Chief of Police John C. Gavallas said in a news conference covered by WTNH.  ""The mother went downstairs to call 911 when she heard a second gunshot, presumably when he shot the daughter on the deck"" Gavallas said. ""He came back in the house and shot the son in the chest.""Watertown Police were called to the home at around 9:47 p.m. and arrived to find the teenagers suffering from life-threatening injuries. They were transported to an area hospital where they both died, police said.The teenagers' deaths were ruled homicides by the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Wednesday.Ferguson was a convicted felon and not authorized to possess a firearm, according to police.

LAPD officer allegedly caught fondling corpse,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/us/lapd-officer-fondle-corpse/index.html," (CNN)An officer with the Los Angeles Police Department is under investigation after his body camera allegedly caught him fondling the body of a dead woman.The officer and his partner were responding to a call about a possible dead body in a residential unit, sources told the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the incident. The officers determined the woman was dead, and while one officer went to get something from the patrol car, the accused officer turned off his body-worn camera and allegedly fondled the deceased woman's breasts, LAPD officials told the LA Times.Though the camera was turned off before the incident, it was captured by the two-minute buffer on the device, the newspaper reported.""The department is aware of the incident and an internal investigation has been launched,"" LAPD officer Jeff Lee said, adding that he cannot comment further on pending personnel matters.LAPD Assistant Chief Robert Arcos told the LA Times the recording was ""very disturbing.""

"Boston Marathon bomber appeals his death sentence, alleging juror bias",https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/us/boston-marathon-bomber-appeal/index.html," (CNN)The surviving Boston Marathon bomber who was sentenced to death for his role in the terror plot that killed four and left the city under siege in April 2013, is hoping his legal team's appeal will give him his life back.Lawyers representing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 26, made opening statements on Thursday morning to the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in hopes of overturning his death sentence. Attorney Daniel Habib argued that Tsarnaev did not get a fair trial because Boston was the scene of the mayhem. He argued that the jury was made up of people directly affected by the terror plot who already had made up their mind about Tsarnaev.Habib spoke about how all of Boston was traumatized by the bombing, with some forced to shelter in place during the manhunt and others who spilled into the streets and cheered when Tsarnaev was caught.""It was the extraordinary effect of this crime on the community,"" Habib said. ""This community atmosphere filtered to the actual jury.""Habib further said that the jury pool was tainted by news reports that contained, what he called, ""a wealth of inadmissible evidence,"" like former Boston Mayor Tom Menino calling for Tsarnaev to receive the death penalty.Two jurors had shown clear bias, Habib said. The first, Juror 286, discussed the case years before the trial, posting tweets that called Tsarnaev a ""piece of garbage"" and admitting that she sheltered in her home with her family during the manhunt. Juror 138 discussed being a part of jury selection while it was underway in a series of Facebook posts, even noting that Tsarnaev sat just a few feet away from him, ""This points only to one direction and that direction is bias,"" Habib said. Assistant US Attorney William Glaser countered by arguing that both jurors had disclosed their actions, saying that Juror 286 was not traumatized by the incident by the time the trial took place. ""It's not whether at the time [Juror 286] felt any emotion about it but whether 20 months later she harbored any prejudice,"" argued Glaser. Glaser said Juror 138 had told the court about his Facebook posts and even admitted to discussing the case previously at family gatherings, saying he went out of his way to ""disclose information that he felt might keep him off the jury."" Glaser added that news reports could not have affected the jury because many of them admitted to not paying much attention to reports. ""Many of them indicated that they didn't pay too much attention to the news and that they wouldn't let their biases affect their decision,"" Glaser said. The panel of judges, Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, Juan Torruella and William Kayatta, expressed concern about questions that were not asked during jury selection that Habib said would have shown bias. Habib said questions at jury selection had to stretch farther than just news reports.""They were listening to their family, to their friends, complete strangers, even social media,"" Habib said. Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 chargesDzhokar was 19 years old when he and his brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to Boston's Boylston Street shortly before 3 p.m. on April 15, 2013, to carry out their plot. Surveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.  Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and BBs, prosecutors said. The bomb killed Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.The second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, Martin Richard, 8, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China.The bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city. The brothers, while on the run, killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, Sean Collier. After they stole an SUV, the two were chased by police.Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby Watertown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested a day later and convicted for his role in the bombings. He was sentenced to death in 2015.Tsarnaev is currently being held in federal prison in Florence, Colorado, and is not expected to be in the courtroom when lawyers make their opening statements.He was convicted in 2015 of all 30 counts he faced, which included all four deaths."

Three were shown wearing bright yellow vests.The teens escaped the facility Saturday after the 9 p.m. usual bedtime when a staff supervisor left them unsupervised as they cleaned an area inside the facility. The supervisor went to a different floor to address a disturbance, the company managing the center said.They entered an elevator that had been left open by a staff member, according to a statement from Davidson County Juvenile Court.They were ""able to convince a staff member to make a call to Master Control and request that the elevator be sent to the basement, which is an unsecured area youth are not permitted to access,"" the statement said.Surveillance video shows the group running through empty hallways and escaping through the glass front door.Authorities had said the teens likely received some assistance once they were outside, but no one else other than the teens appears on the surveillance footage released Tuesday.Youth Opportunity Investments, a private detention contractor which has managed the center since 2015, has fired three of its employees and suspended one for three days in reaction to the escape, the company said.CNN's Nicole Chavez and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.

California man accused of posting threatening videos pleads not guilty to weapons charges,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/us/san-diego-gun-arrest/index.html," (CNN)A California man accused of posting online videos that appear to threaten gun violence pleaded not guilty Monday to weapons and child endangerment charges. Steven Homoki, 30, was arrested after the San Diego Joint Terrorism Task Force received a report of ""distressing YouTube videos threatening firearm violence,"" according to a police news release.On Monday, prosecutors outlined the case against him in San Diego Superior Court, noting that the videos show him inside a hotel room and aiming a handgun and an assault-style rifle at unsuspecting pedestrians outside, and saying ""boom"" as he pretends to fire the weapon.He is charged with three counts of possession of an assault weapon and three counts of child abuse. The abuse charges were lodged because he had unsecured guns in the home where children were present, said Wendy Patrick, a deputy district attorney in the San Diego County District Attorney's Office. Homoki's three minor children lived in the home, Patrick said.Homoki's bail was set $1 million by Judge Joseph Brannigan, who said ""there's an obvious danger to the community."" Homoki is expected back in court for a status conference hearing on December 18.CNN has reached out to the public defender assigned to Homoki but has not heard back.Arrest came after a tip about online videosThe San Diego Police Joint Terrorism Task Force received a tip on December 2 about online videos in which Homoki threatened gun violence, according to the release. The tip was sent in by an anonymous person who knew Homoki from Discord, an online platform designed for video gaming communities to communicate via a chat channel, according to the search warrant for his residence.The anonymous tipster said they feared Homoki was planning something because he had becoming less stable and said, ""almost guarantee if he ... is confronted while at home, he will open fire on Federal Agents or police,"" according to the search warrant.Authorities linked the videos to Homoki, and he was arrested without incident at his Spring Valley, California, home on December 5 when authorities executed a search warrant of his residence, the release said.The search warrant said Homoki had 14 firearms registered in California that were purchased between February 2018 and May 2019.  According to the warrant, 12 rifles and rifle parts, two semi-automatic handguns and one revolver were found in the search of Homoki's home, car and a shed at his house. Two of the rifles were AR-15 style rifle, one with a 60-round drum magazine.Patrick said three of the rifles had been modified since their purchase in a manner that made them illegal, but declined to say what modifications had been made.Multiple high-capacity magazines were found in the house, a vehicle and the shed, and the three handguns were found in a bag in the house's master bedroom, according to the warrant. The warrant references two videos posted to a YouTube channel under the screen name of ""Steven Anderson"" in which someone in a San Diego hotel appears to be pointing weapons at pedestrians outside the hotel. ""The video shows the interior of the hotel room and the subject again points the handgun out the window and tracks a pedestrian crossing the street with the firearm and 'dry fires' at the pedestrian. He then switches to one of the assault style rifles and again points it out the window and dry fires,"" the warrant states. ""He then gets the other assault style rifle and again dry fires out the window at pedestrians.""In an interview with San Diego TV station KFMB, Homoki denied any plans for a mass shooting or act of terrorism, saying the videos were purely for his own private entertainment.""It was a curiosity, a miniature art project for myself,"" he said from jail. ""Just to kinda get into a mindset and just kind of booked it out for a night in a hotel, I just wanted to relax maybe do something a little bit fun and different.""Suspect: Videos 'blown out of proportion'Homoki said the videos ""got blown out of proportion"" but conceded, ""Obviously, looking back, it looks like if anybody else were to see it, it doesn't look good.""He said he did not mean to cause anyone any harm.""Hopefully, they can see it the way I do, that I do not wish to cause harm to anybody, this is not an act of terrorism at all,"" he said.Lt. Shawn Takeuchi with the San Diego Police Department said the tip from the community was crucial.""This arrest is an example of a community member coming forward with information that posed an immediate threat to San Diegans,"" Takeuchi told KFMB. ""The San Diego Police Department would like to thank the community for their shared efforts to keep everyone safe.""Scott Brunner, the head of the FBI's San Diego office, called the arrest an ""extraordinary accomplishment"" and commended the task force for their quick work in locating and apprehending Homoki.""The extraordinarily swift investigative efforts put forth by the dedicated Agents and Officers of the San Diego JTTF quickly identified, located and arrested Mr. Homoki, preventing further incident,"" Brunner said in a statement. ""Just three days ago Mr. Homoki was an unknown poster of disturbing videos and is now behind bars, his threats neutralized.""CNN's Cheri Mossburg, Paul Vercammen and Jeanne Bonner contributed to this report."
