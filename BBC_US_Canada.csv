Internet-famous cat Lil Bub dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50638540,"Lil Bub, one of the internet's most famous cats, has died aged eight.The cat's owner, Mike Bridavsky, announced her death to millions of followers on social media on Monday.Lil Bub was best known for her unusual appearance - bulbous eyes and a protruding tongue. She was rescued as a feral kitten and was born with several disorders, including dwarfism. Mr Bridavsky said she helped raise more than $700,000 (¬£540,000) for animal charities during her lifetime.""Bub has made a huge difference in the world of animal welfare, and in the lives of millions of people worldwide,"" a post on Instagram said.Lil Bub found online fame because of her unique appearance. Her feline dwarfism meant she stayed kitten-sized throughout her life. She was also polydactyl, with an extra toe on each paw, and had an underdeveloped jaw and no teeth which caused her tongue to always hang out. A post shared by Lil BUB (@iamlilbub) on Dec 1, 2019 at 12:23pm PSTEnd of Instagram post  by iamlilbubMr Bridavsky originally adopted Lil Bub as the ""runt"" of a litter of kittens found by a friend inside a tool-shed in Indiana.In an interview, he described her ""one of nature's happiest accidents"" and insisted she lived a happy, healthy life despite her various health issues. He created a Tumblr blog for the cat in 2011 and she went viral after photographs of her ended up on the front page of discussion website Reddit. The attention led to news articles about her and invitations to appear on US television programmes. Lil Bub went on to gain endorsement deals, merchandise lines and even her own YouTube show and documentary series. Her owner used her fame to raise money for charity, including help for other cats with special needs through the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.Before her death, Lil Bub had been suffering from a bone infection which her owner had been sharing updates about to her 2.4m Instagram followers. Mr Bridavsky announced on Monday that she had unexpectedly died in her sleep on Sunday morning.  This is my first photo with BUB next our last photo together. On the morning of Sunday, December 1st 2019 we lost the purest, kindest and most magical living force on our planet. BUB was cheerful and full of love laying in our bed with us Saturday night, but unexpectedly passed away peacefully in her sleep.. I have always been fully transparent about BUB's health, and it was no secret that she was battling a persistent and aggressive bone infection. Even knowing this, we weren't expecting her to pass so soon or so abruptly without warning. I truly believe that she willingly made the decision to leave her failing body so that our family would not have to make that difficult decision ourselves.  It is impossible to put into words the profound effect that BUB has had on my life, on the lives of thousands of homeless pets, and on the lives of those of you that have cared for her as if she were your own family. She taught me everything that I know about unconditional love, she brought my wife Stacy and I together, she's the reason we have our beautiful children Rosco and Lula, and she has been a constant source of warmth and love in our lives for the past 8 years. To say that our family is devastated would be an understatement. But most importantly, BUB has made a huge difference in the world of animal welfare, and in the lives of millions of people worldwide. She has literally saved thousands of lives (both pets and humans), she started the first national fund for special needs pets, she was the subject of groundbreaking genetic and biological research, she's helped raise over $700,000 for animals in need, and has spread a message of determination, positivity, and perseverance to people all over the world. And even though my heart is absolutely crushed by her graceful departure from planet Earth, I know that her sprit, magic, and overwhelming energy are still with us, reminding us every day to be better. Dearest BUB, I will never forget your generosity, your limitless supply of love, or your uncanny ability to bring so much magic and joy to the world. I am forever honored and humbled that you chose me as your caretaker. Please visit all of us in our dreams oA post shared by  Lil BUB (@iamlilbub) on Dec 2, 2019 at 9:25am PSTEnd of Instagram post 2 by iamlilbubThe owner said his cat had ""spread a message of determination, positivity, and perseverance to people all over the world"" during her life. Tens of thousands of people have commented and shared the online posts announcing the cat's death. Among those responding on Facebook - where she had more than three million followers - were people who work for animal charities which have benefited from the funds raised by Lil Bub's owner in his cat's name. Lil Bub's death comes seven months after the death of Grumpy Cat, another feline internet legend.10) Venus the Two Face Cat (@venustwofacecat), a tortoiseshell cat from the US, 2m followers You take that back Mom!

Canadians held for a year by China are 'resilient',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50592055,"Friends and colleagues of two Canadians arrested by China are speaking out on the anniversary of the pair's detention. Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, were both detained on 10 December 2018.China has accused the pair of espionage. The move by Beijing is widely viewed as ""hostage diplomacy"" - a tactic to put the pressure on Canada to release Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Beijing denies the men's cases are related to Ms Meng's arrest in Canada last year, but supporters say the two are being used as pawns in a larger political dispute. The Canadian government says neither man has had access to a lawyer and have been denied contact with their families and loved ones.""Our heart goes out to the two Canadians detained in China unjustly,"" said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. ""It's difficult to even describe this cloud, or the weight that hangs over an organisation when your colleague, your friend has been in a Chinese prison for a year,"" Brittany Brown, with the International Crisis Group, Mr Kovrig's employer, told the BBC.  ""Not a day goes by that someone in Crisis Group is doing something, engaging with someone, talking with someone, pushing certain points behind the scenes to try and support the Canadian [government] efforts,"" she said. Current and past presidents from the NGO published an open letter last week calling his detention ""unjust and inhumane"". Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to Beijing, said that during a recent consular visit, Mr Kovrig asked officials: ""When are you going to get me out of this mess?""""You need to have some hope,"" says Mr Saint-Jacques, who once worked with the ex-diplomat. Robert Malley, Mr Kovrig's boss, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation his colleague was resilient and has maintained his ""sense of humour and a sense of perspective"".Mr Spavor also has a network of supporters who are doing what they can to help secure his release, says friend Brian Gold.They have launched an online fundraiser to help the businessman get back on his feet once he is released, and Mr Gold says knowing he has support from outside is lifting his spirits.""We're just very proud of how resilient he is being under this situation,"" he says. ""It adds to my points of admiration for him, in the way that he's dealing with this.""  Canada has repeatedly called the detention of the two men ""arbitrary"". In September, Mr Trudeau accused Beijing of using ""pressure tactics"" to try to secure the release of Ms Meng and said that China is ""using arbitrary detention as a tool to achieve political goals"".The Canadian government has sought the support of allies such as Britain, France, Germany and the US to pressure China for the pair's release. New foreign affairs minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, has told his Chinese counterpart the two men's case was his ""absolute priority"".Ms Meng was detained in Vancouver on 1 December 2018 at the request of US officials. She is the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant as well as the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei. Her arrest angered Chinese officials. She is out on bail in Canada while fighting extradition to the US, where she is wanted for a host of charges, including evading sanctions on Iran - something she and Huawei deny. Her extradition hearing is due to begin in January. On the anniversary of her own arrest, she published a letter on the Huawei website and on social media thanking her supporters in Canada. As part of the bail conditions, she was given an electronic ankle bracelet monitoring tag and a curfew, but is allowed to travel around much of Vancouver.The executive said in her letter that due to her circumstances, she now has time to read and paint. Those close to Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor are drawing a contrast between her situation and theirs. The pair are being held in a detention centre and are allowed only infrequent visits from consular staff. In April, it was reported that both men were being interrogated for between six to eight hours a day, and were sometimes subject to 24-hour artificial lighting.In July, guards reportedly confiscated Mr Kovrig's reading glasses.It has led to a diplomatic and trade row between Canada and China, with China blocking tens millions of dollars of canola exports, as well as until recently, pork products. Chinese officials have called the Huawei executive's arrest a ""serious mistake"" and accused Canada of double standards.China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said this month the release of the Huawei executive was a ""precondition"" for improved Canada-US relations.Over the last year, Canadians views on China in general have soured, according to the Pew Research Center. Their latest Global Attitudes survey found that a majority of Canadians had a negative view of China, with 67% of respondents telling the organisation they held an unfavourable view of the Asian nation. Those negative opinions rose 22 points in the wake of Ms Meng's arrest and the detainment of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor, Pew says. "
US bishop resigns amid abuse cover-up accusations,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50664458,"The Vatican has announced the resignation of a US bishop who faced widespread criticism for his handling of sexual abuse claims. Bishop Richard J Malone of New York state's Buffalo oversaw one of the country's most scandal-hit dioceses.It is facing more than 200 lawsuits and an FBI investigation. In a statement, Mr Malone said that ""after much prayer and discernment"" he had decided the diocese would be better served by a new bishop.At 73, he is leaving earlier than the 75-year mark that is the mandatory age for bishops to offer their retirement. ""As you are well aware, we have faced tremendous turmoil over the past year-and-a-half,"" Mr Malone said in the statement. ""Some have attributed this to my own shortcomings, but the turmoil also reflects the culmination of systemic failings over many years in the worldwide handling of sexual abuse of minors by members of the clergy.""  Mr Malone was accused of cover-ups and faced embarrassing leaks. One contained Mr Malone's interactions with Church lawyers which appeared to try and limit the damage of abuse allegations.Secret audio recordings this year suggested Bishop Malone was worried a scandal involving sexual harassment of a seminarian by a pastor ""could be the end of me as bishop"".Another leak showed that he was hesitant about removing a priest whom he referred to as a ""sick puppy"".The diocese had avoided any major scandals until 2018 when complaints of abuse started emerging. In March of that year, Mr Malone released a document showing 42 priests who had been accused of sexual abuse, mostly from past decades. But his former assistant said an earlier draft contained upwards of 100 names. A recent poll conducted by The Buffalo News suggested that 86% of local Catholics wanted the bishop to go. Fewer than 3% of those surveyed said he should stay on.A petition signed by more than 12,000 people called for his departure.  ""I have concluded after much prayer and discernment that the spiritual welfare of the people of the Diocese of Buffalo will be better served by a new bishop who perhaps is better able to bring about the reconciliation, healing and renewal that is so needed,"" Mr Malone said.Mr Malone will be replaced on a temporary basis by Albany's bishop, Edward B Scharfenberger.""I will be doing a lot of listening and learning,"" the new bishop said in a statement."
Trump refuses to attend impeachment hearing,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50625550,"The White House has said US President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not attend an impeachment hearing on Wednesday, citing a lack of ""fairness"".The hearing by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee marks the next stage of the probe, with legal experts giving testimony that could lead to a vote of impeachment.It is alleged the president pressured Ukraine to conduct two investigations for his own political gain.Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing.After weeks of closed-door witness interviews and public hearings, the process will now focus on possible charges of misconduct, which could lead to an impeachment vote in the House and trial in the Republican-led Senate.The Democratic-led inquiry centres on a phone call in July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump has dismissed the process as a ""witch hunt"".Last Wednesday, Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invited Mr Trump to attend this week's hearing, ""directly or through a counsel"", saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment.But in a letter to the committee, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of a ""complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness"", saying the invitation would fail to give the White House adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were ""apparently all academics"" and would include ""no fact witnesses"", Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists the judge by offering an opinion. Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler's claim that the process was ""consistent"" with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president's counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure ""that due process rights are protected"" and that the process was ""fair and just"".The letter also accused Democrats of scheduling the hearing ""no doubt purposefully"" to conflict with Mr Trump's visit this week to London for a Nato summit. He is due to return to Washington after the judiciary committee hearing.Mr Cipollone's letter did not say whether Mr Trump would attend a second hearing, which does not yet have a date, but added that a response would be given by Friday.Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (¬£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power.The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president.The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016.First the White House said it would not co-operate with the impeachment probe because it was not formally authorised by the House of Representatives. Then, Donald Trump complained that the congressionally approved process in the Intelligence Committee violated his legal due-process rights.Now the White House says it won't send lawyers to the first Judiciary Committee hearing this week, even though they are permitted to participate.The president still has the opportunity to change course, and Wednesday's hearing could turn out to be a stuffy academic discussion about the impeachment process with little lasting impact, but it's a sign that the White House feels things may be breaking Mr Trump's way.Opinion polls indicate the public's view of impeachment is solidifying on party lines. Those who like the president want the process to end; those who hate him want him gone, whether through impeachment or next November's election. That's a recipe for partisan stalemate. And as long as Republicans continue to stick together, the president has an impenetrable defence against removal from office. While the White House may not be winning the impeachment fight, it's not losing either - and for now that's reason enough to keep the process at arm's length. At the heart of the inquiry is the rough transcript of a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, in which Mr Trump asks for ""a favour"" and wants Ukraine to ""look into"" corruption claims involving the Bidens. These claims remain unsubstantiated.The call prompted a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified CIA officer who said Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"". That complaint sparked an impeachment inquiry which has featured diplomats and White House aides giving testimony to Congress.Several testified that there was a ""shadow"" foreign policy to push Ukraine into opening these investigations, and to announce them publicly. The witnesses linked the president to the promise of a White House meeting but none had direct knowledge he had personally held back the military aid.However, Democrats say the evidence is overwhelming that Mr Trump orchestrated the pressure campaign, and point to an admission of a ""quid pro quo"" by White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney at a press conference.Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the committees leading the probe - Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs - are now working on their report, which will be issued on 3 December.On Wednesday, legal experts yet to be named are expected to be heard by the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for crafting articles of impeachment, or the charges of wrongdoing against the president. It is expected that those charges will be drafted this month. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Senate. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks.If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment."
Elon Musk wins 'pedo guy' defamation case,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695593,"Elon Musk did not defame a British caver who helped in last year's rescue of trapped Thai schoolboys by calling him a ""pedo guy"", a US jury has found.Vernon Unsworth sought $190m (¬£145m) in damages from the Tesla founder, arguing that the tweet damaged his reputation.A public row broke out between the two men over the rescue of 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave in June 2018.Mr Musk told the court this week the phrase ""pedo guy"" was common in South Africa, where he grew up.Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom after the jury reached its decision, Mr Musk said: ""My faith in humanity is restored.""Mr Unsworth's lawyer Lin Wood said their side would leave the court ""with our heads held high"" but that the decision was ""not a good verdict for society"".""This verdict sends a signal, and one signal only - that you can make any accusation you want to, as vile as it may be and as untrue as it may be, and somebody can get away with it,"" he said.The case had been closely watched as it was seen as testing the legal threshold in the US for defamatory material on social media. Appearing dejected, Mr Unsworth himself added: ""I respect the jury's decision. I'd just like to say my legal team have been absolutely awesome. I came here for a verdict, unfortunately it's not gone the way I expected but I respect the jury's decision and thank them for that.""Jurors took less than an hour to return their unanimous verdict, following a four-day trial at a federal court in Los Angeles.Jury foreman Joshua Jones said Mr Unsworth's legal team were unable to prove their case and should have focused more on the evidence.""I think they tried to get our emotions involved in it,"" he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.Mr Unsworth, an experienced 64-year-old cave explorer, splits his time between the UK and Thailand. During the rescue of the young football team, which captured the world's attention, Mr Unsworth helped recruit expert cave divers who were instrumental in freeing the boys safely.Mr Musk sent Tesla engineers and a small submarine to northern Thailand to help with the rescue effort, but the vessel was never used.Instead, he and Mr Unsworth got into a public war of words after the diver branded the offer of help a ""PR stunt"".During an interview with CNN, the diver suggested the billionaire ""stick his submarine where it hurts"".Mr Musk, who now has nearly 30 million followers, responded with a series of tweets about Mr Unsworth - including the one calling him ""pedo guy"". It was later deleted.Reporting from the courtroomOne of the smartest moves by Elon Musk's defence was in introducing the concept of ""JDart"", an acronym to describe their client's conduct on Twitter in relation to the infamous ""pedo guy"" tweet.A JDart, lawyer Alex Spiro explained, meant: a Joke that was badly received, therefore Deleted, with an Apology and then Responsive Tweets to move on from the matter. JDart. It's clumsy, for sure, but it meant Mr Spiro could offer the jury here a degree of structure around what before seemed senseless: Mr Musk may have acted foolishly with the J, but he soon ""darted"", which is how you know he wasn't being serious about the allegation.Expect the JDart ""standard"" to be applied again and again, not just in libel trials, but in any arena where social media behaviour is under scrutiny - a parachute for anyone who, in the heat of the moment, says something idiotic online.Testifying over two days on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr Musk told the court he did not expect the ""pedo"" tweet to be taken literally.He said that at the time he thought Mr Unsworth was ""just some random creepy guy"" who was ""unrelated to the rescue"".Mr Musk apologised on Twitter and in court for his outburst.Contesting this, Mr Wood cited another now-deleted tweet the billionaire sent to his followers saying: ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.""He also cited an email exchange that Mr Musk had with a Buzzfeed reporter who contacted him for comment on the threat of legal action, where the entrepreneur said: ""Stop defending child rapists.""Mr Wood said Mr Musk was a ""billionaire bully"" who had ""dropped a nuclear bomb"" on his client, and that the tweet had affected his career and relationships.On Thursday, Mr Unsworth told the court that Mr Musk's tweet had left him feeling ""humiliated"".Reporters in court said the diver appeared on the verge of tears as he told jurors: ""It feels very raw. I feel humiliated. Ashamed. Dirtied. Effectively, from day one, I was given a life sentence without parole. It hurts to talk about it.""He added: ""I find it disgusting. I find it very hard to even read the word, never mind talk about.""Alex Spiro, Mr Musk's lawyer, argued that the ""pedo guy"" tweet was an offhand comment made in the course of an argument between the two men, which no-one could be expected to take seriously.""In arguments you insult people,"" he said. ""There is no bomb. No bomb went off."""
Friends actor Ron Leibman dies at the age of 82,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50698015,"Award-winning American actor Ron Leibman, famed for playing Rachel Green's overbearing dad in the sitcom Friends, has died at the age of 82.His agent said the cause was pneumonia.While best known for his role in the US sitcom, Leibman had a decorated career in TV and film spanning six decades.""Ron was an incredibly talented actor with a distinguished career in film, TV and theatre. Our thoughts go out to his wife, Jessica (Walter), and his family,"" his agent said in a statement.Born in New York in 1937, Leibman won an Emmy award in 1979 for the series Kaz, which he created, and a Tony award for Tony Kushner's play Angels in America.He appeared in numerous films including Norma Rae and Slaughterhouse-Five.But his role as Dr Leonard Green in Friends is how he will be remembered best.Many have taken to social media to pay tribute to Leibman.""So many of the best memories of my career have Ron Leibman in them. Thank you, Ron. For my being my champion. Rest, my friend,"" said Sally Field, who won an Oscar for Norma Rae."
UK coal miner's daughter turned White House aide,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50507853,"When former White House national security adviser Fiona Hill took to the stand to testify in the US impeachment inquiry, she began with the story of her life.Unlike many others speaking in the investigation into US President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, Ms Hill has not always been a US citizen.The straight-talking Russia expert hails from humble beginnings in the north-east of England.The 54-year-old told lawmakers of how she came from a family of coal miners who ""always struggled with poverty"".""When my father, Alfred, was 14, he joined his father, brother, uncles and cousins in the coal mines to help put food on the table,"" she explained. She also confirmed a story which illustrates her own toughness, as well as a sense of humour. At 11 years old, a school boy set her pigtails on fire while she was taking a test. She put the fire out with her own hands and finished the test.""It had some very unfortunate consequences. Afterwards, my mother gave me a bowl haircut. So for the school photograph... I looked like Richard III,"" she joked. Ms Hill spoke in the inquiry of an affinity she had always felt to the US.Hailing from the market town of Bishop Auckland in County Durham, Ms Hill noted that ""both the region and my family have deep ties to the United States.""""I was born... in the same region George Washington's ancestors came from... My paternal grandfather fought through World War I in the Royal Field Artillery, surviving being shot, shelled, and gassed before American troops intervened to end the war in 1918,"" she said. While her father was unable to realise his ""dream of emigrating to America"", she said he had always hoped that someone in the family would make the move.For Ms Hill, that opportunity came in the 1980s. During an academic exchange in the then Soviet Union, she met an American professor who told her about graduate scholarships to the US.In 1989, Russian-speaking Ms Hill made the move across the Atlantic to study at Harvard University, where she ultimately earned her PhD.Ms Hill, who became a US citizen in 2002, says the country has offered her opportunities she ""would never have had"" in England. ""I grew up poor with a very distinctive working-class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement,"" she told investigators. ""This background has never set me back in America.""In a career spanning nearly three decades, she has established herself as a top expert on the former Soviet Union and describes herself as a ""nonpartisan, nonpolitical national security professional"".She has worked closely with three presidents - George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump - to offer expert advice on Russia and the former Soviet republics. It is her role on Mr Trump's National Security Council (NSC) that has brought her to the impeachment inquiry.According to the New York Times, Ms Hill's decision to accept a role in the NSC in 2017 ""strained friendships and made her a target of right-wing conspiracy theorists who spread rumours that she was a Democratic mole"".Ms Hill told the inquiry that when she accepted the position she thought she could help with Mr Trump's ""stated goal of improving relations with Russia, while still implementing policies designed to deter Russian conduct that threatens the United States"".But, she said, the president disregarded the advice of senior advisers who said Russia had meddled in the 2016 election, instead listening to the views of his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and pushing a false theory that it was Ukraine. She told lawmakers this was a ""fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""While Ms Hill stepped down shortly before the phone call at the centre of the inquiry, she witnessed earlier talks between US and Ukrainian officials in which she said a deal between the two presidents was mentioned.  Ms Hill told the inquiry of a ""couple of testy encounters"" she had with ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland over Ukraine, because he did not keep her informed of ""all of the meetings he was having"".On one occasion, she said: ""I was actually, to be honest, angry with him. And I hate to say it but often when women show anger it's not fully appreciated, it's often pushed off onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected on other people.""The remark and wider testimony earned her praise on social media, where she was described as relatable and courageous. But the attention was not something she was looking for when she stepped away from the NSC, apparently hoping to spend more time with her family. ""I don't think she was thinking, 'I'm going to go out in a blaze of glory, take a moral stand and testify.' That was definitely not her intention. She just wanted to do her job with no fuss or drama,"" her former colleague and friend Tom Wright told the New York Times. "
The place where dead eagles are given a new life,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50089990,"The eagle is America's national bird but when these revered creatures die, who takes care to ensure they end up in the right hands?Warning: This story contains images of dead and dissected eaglesFew symbols are as potent as the American eagle.This magnificent bird of prey is the country's national bird, and a powerful emblem of freedom found on everything from military flags to the dollar bill. As such, it's illegal for anyone in the US to possess or disturb Golden Eagles or Bald Eagles - dead or alive - unless there is a special exemption in place.Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940, it is against the law to even pick up a discarded feather.But for many Native Americans and Alaska natives, the eagle is a sacred creature and there is a strong cultural tradition requiring bird parts for ceremonies and rituals.That's where the National Eagle Repository in Colorado comes in.Every day around 30 to 40 eagle carcasses arrive at the centre, which is run by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to be checked over and prepared for the next stage in their journey.The four-member team takes in birds from all US states except Hawaii, and helps distribute them to the country's 573 federally recognised tribes.Liza Roman has worked at the repository for six years. Her role is to process all of the applications that come in and ensure that relations with the tribal members run smoothly. ""We take in about 500 orders a month,"" she told the BBC. Applicants have to show proof they are a member of a federally recognised tribe and that they are over 18-years-old, otherwise they are not eligible.""The national eagle programme was established specifically for Native American religious use and ceremonial purposes,"" ""They can also ask for a whole bird or individual feathers and have to specify from what sort of bird they need and the age of the bird.""Roman says some eagles are harder to come by than others.""Our repository runs off of supply and demand,"" she says. ""The highest demand right now is for our immature golden eagle with the wait time for that running at seven and a half years. The quicker the tribes put an application in, the faster they get on that waitlist. It's first come, first served.""Bald eagles, however, have just about a two month turnaround.For Native Americans, the eagle is a creature to be revered. Hanley Frost Sr is the cultural co-ordinator for the Southern Ute Indian Tribe in Colorado. He is one of many tribal leaders responsible for ceremonies. Mr Frost Sr, who is a Mouache Caputa tribal member, explains that the feathers are sacred and have spiritual significance.  ""The eagles are a symbol of great spiritual healing power. The eagle carries our prayers as it's the only animal that can go much further into the sky - towards the heavens and so carry these prayers with it.  Its eyes can see a great distance, while the wings and the feathers are able to carry this creature in any direction it wants to go.""He said that fans made from the feathers are used for healing and blessing purposes while eagle bones can be shaped into whistles for sun dance ceremonies and other rituals.""This bird was able to travel great distance and great height and see the things we can't. The feathers in my possession represent one of the greatest honours anyone can ever receive as a native,"" he adds.Back at the repository in Commerce City, Colorado all of the staff say that they love their jobs because it helps them protect America's national bird and understand more about the cultural significance of the bird for indigenous people. ""I love the exposure to the culture - the Native Americans and Alaska Natives all have different traditional ceremonies - all with a purpose,"" Ms Roman says.""Working with them and the eagles gives you a different perspective for the species as a whole.""The repository was first created in the 1970s to recognise the significance of eagle feathers to Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Its current form emerged in 1994, after then-President Bill Clinton signed a memorandum requiring dead eagles to be sent to the repository. The repository moved from Oregon to Colorado in 1995, where it has been ever since.While the US has seen a decline in bird numbers over the past half a century, the Bald Eagle, with its white head and white tail feathers, is viewed as a conservation success story. In 2007 it was removed from the US Endangered Species Act. Golden Eagles however, which nest on cliffs or high trees, remain protected under several acts.Scientist Laura Mallory says that every time she picks up one of the birds, she has three things in mind - how the creature died; is the person receiving the bird actually going to be able to use it; and thirdly, what condition is it in?She asks questions such as: ""Is it covered in larvae from insects; it is covered in seaweed; does it have any nutritional deficiencies that have caused it to have any deformities?""The staff have had to adapt their techniques of evaluating the birds over the years. More recently they have started experimenting with a flesh eating beetle colony which is a more natural way of treating the feathers.When Mallory began at the repository just over a year ago, it would take her up to 15 minutes to check each bird - now it just takes five minutes. Her job has also meant she's had to become an expert at feather identification. ""I have to be able to weed out any random bird feathers that come in - even if they look like eagle feathers. A lot of people mistake turkey or vulture feathers for an eagle's but when you flip it over, it's the sheen that makes it a different type of feather.""With demand so high and supply limited, there have been several programmes put into place to try to help the situation and also hinder the black market that exists for eagle parts.""There are those who will sell parts for money but we try to make sure we know the people who have the parts and keep documentary records,"" Mr Frost Sr says. ""So if someone shows up with an eagle feather but is a non-native, we know where they got it from.""Over the last decade certain Native American tribes have been given permits allowing them to keep live eagles and use feathers that have been naturally discarded. These include rescue birds, whom because of sickness or injury are unable to be rehabilitated and returned to the wild.And in August this year, the US and Fish and Wildlife Service loosened some of its restrictions around bald and eagle remains following consultation with recognised tribes. Now those tribes with a special permit are able to keep feathers and parts found on certain lands. There are still many caveats in play but the government described this as a ""monumental decision"".Although the repository currently only caters for requests from federally recognised tribes, there is heated debated around access rights.The US Fish and Wildlife Service is currently examining the responses to a formal petition submitted by Robert Soto, pastor of McAllen Grace Brethren Church in Texas and The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. The petition seeks access to feathers for non-federally recognised tribes and those - Native American or not - who are ""sincere religious believers"". There is opposition from many tribes who say it's already difficult to get hold of feathers.Back in her lab surrounded by talons, feathers, whole birds and more, Laura Mallory carefully holds a feather up high.She says: ""It just really changes your perspectives when looking at these eagles - they may come in dead but they have this magnificence around them in terms of knowing that when they leave here - just what they are going on to do.""Photography and accompanying cinematography by Hannah Long-Higgins"
Has a US university cracked student debt?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50551565,"The cost of further education is reshaping America. But as tuition prices soar across the country, one university in Kentucky has found a way to cover the costs. There's just one catch - the students have to work for it.""Scholarships or student loans"". These were the available choices for 18-year-old Sophie Nwaorkoro to cover the costs of university.A family crisis in her final year of high school derailed option one. She found herself homeless and without the financial support needed to help plug the gaps left from any scholarships.Option two - taking out loans - would have placed Sophie among millions of her peers who enter adulthood bound to payments on their student loans. Most estimates put total student debt at $1.5tn (¬£1.2tn) - more than what Americans owe on credit cards. And nearly half of borrowers default on the loans.""I wouldn't have risked it,"" she says. ""Debt kind of spelled out the end of my freedom."" Sophie had resigned herself to not continuing her education, until she got a call from Berea College, a small undergraduate university nestled in rural Kentucky. The representative told Sophie they would cover everything. ""When she told me that I broke down and cried,"" Sophie recalls. ""They just opened up a door that I was really sure had been closed."" Berea College was founded in 1855 by John Fee, a Christian minister and an abolitionist. It was the first integrated, co-educational college in the American South.Its modern campus sits on the same ridge as the school's original building - now a small constellation of brick buildings and white columns that could be crossed, unhurried, in about 15 minutes. Since its inception, Berea was meant for students who could not afford college - costs were nominal, and students worked on campus to help support themselves.And, in 1892, it stopped charging tuition entirely. ""What's unusual about Berea is that for, I'll bet 70% to 80% of our students, this is their only shot at a high-quality educational experience,"" says Berea President Lyle Roelofs. More than half of Berea's incoming 2018 class had an expected family contribution of $0. The mean family income of a first-year student is less than $30,000 (¬£23,000). Around 70% of students are from Appalachia, where around one in five people live below the poverty line.  ""We have always realised there are people who need education who can't afford to pay for it,"" says Mr Roelofs. ""The 'how' is much more complicated."" The ""how"" is twofold.First, there is Berea's endowment which, as of this year, has ballooned to $1.2bn (¬£930m), a product of nearly 165 years of growth.""If you don't have tuition revenue, then you want to have a powerful friend like the American stock market,"" says Mr Roelofs. The endowment is effectively safeguarded by the school's commitment to free tuition. A renovation or campus upgrade will only be approved once every student's tuition is assured. Its growth has also been spurred by a particularly prescient vote by Berea's board in 1920, which ensured that any unrestricted bequests - donations left without a specific purpose - would be added to the endowment. Now, about $60m is withdrawn from the endowment each year to support Berea's operating budget, including tuition.The second unique feature at Berea is the labour programme, which requires each student to work on campus for at least 10 hours every week, similar to a federal work-study programme at other US universities.""At Berea College, no student pays tuition for a high-quality education, but every student works,"" says Roelofs. ""We don't just admit every student, we hire every student.""The jobs are essential to Berea's operation - both the students' labour and a portion of their pay cheque is used to keep the college running. ""It's not the most romantic thing,"" says Sophie who, in her role in the dining hall, works with ""absolutely everybody's trash"". ""I know some people might look down on it, but you kind of go in there with a sense that 'I'm doing something that's helping people.'"" And there's an obvious payoff - in 2019, 49% of Berea students graduated with zero debt, even after food, housing and other living expenses. For those that did, they held an average of $6,693 - around one quarter of the national average.Berea is small, about 1,600 undergraduate students and - for obvious reasons - it doesn't boast many shiny amenities that could be used to sell itself at college fairs.""We don't add those kinds of appealing features that are just there to attract wealthy students to come,"" Roelofs says. ""You know, a lazy river or a climbing wall contributes almost nothing to the educational experience"". It lacks the name recognition of elite schools scattered throughout the country's coasts, and is only reliably known to those living in surrounding Appalachia. ""When I heard about it, it sounded sketchy,"" Sophie said. ""If it were free, then it must be poor quality.""But Berea does not look or feel like a discount university.The campus is archetypically collegiate. Student life is narrated by church bells, the grounds punctuated by tree-lined quads. It is ensconced within 9,000 acres of the college's own green space, which drifts into hundreds of miles of forest in the Appalachian foothills of eastern Kentucky.At the school in October, students often made casual reference to their ""Berea story"", campus shorthand for the challenge or trauma that threatened their chance at college - a common trait among students. But just as quickly, the conversation turned back to plans for homecoming or upcoming exams. This is perhaps Berea's greatest feat - for its students, daily life is insulated from pending student debt. It is also the most selective school in the state, according to Berea's admission records. Students are accepted on the grounds of both academic performance and financial status.In 2018, 97% of its incoming class were eligible for Pell grants, a federal grant awarded only to those ""who display exceptional financial need"".Many of the students mention Berea's academic rigour, a surprise for some who assumed that ""tuition-free"" is code for cheapened education. ""You definitely can't come here and slack off,"" says Sophie.""I think we're so used to colleges being so expensive that we kind of expect them to be expensive. We dismissed the idea of a college that can be affordable.""The struggle to pay for college is a defining feature of working families in America, says New York University Professor Caitlin Zaloom, who studies the toll of student debt on families. ""The escalation in college costs can't go much farther.""The stress carries on long after graduation both for parents and for students, she says. ""The debt and the costs orient their lives for years afterwards."" But as going to university increasingly becomes a ""moral imperative"", a requisite for job stability and upward mobility, government funding for higher education has plummeted.Between 2008 and 2017, overall state funding for public two- and four-year colleges fell by nearly $9bn after inflation, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research group.These cuts to government funding have been met with steep tuition hikes, effectively pushing American families toward loans. ""The largest lender is the federal government,"" says Ms Zaloom. ""It is very clear that the federal government is expecting its citizens to pay for college with loans. That's the message that families get very, very clearly from day one."" In just the past decade, student debt has more than doubled, jumping from $675bn to today's $1.5tn. ""I think we're really at a breaking point,"" says Ms Zaloom. ""It's simply not morally supportable to require young adults to start their lives in so much debt."" So what should be done about it?There is broad agreement that university tuition in the US is too expensive, but there is no resulting consensus on the solution. Most American colleges provide a patchwork of scholarships and loans to help lighten the cost. The notion of doing it for all - like Berea - is slowly gaining ground. New Mexico's state government recently announced plans to make state schools free for all students, regardless of family income, using revenues from the state's booming oil industry. And some leading candidates in the 2020 Democratic race have embraced the concept of free tuition.But Mr Roelofs thinks ""free tuition"" can be a fragile tagline when left on its own.Just declaring college education free is not the answer - it needs to be free and high quality, he says.For its 1,600 students, Berea's model works. But it has had a 126-year head start.""In order to really do what Berea does, you have to come up with a pretty big amount of money just to get yourself going,"" he says. The challenge is then ""scaling up"". Berea's small size and its long-term commitment to growing its endowment for free tuition have given it a sizable lead that other universities may struggle to reproduce. But Mr Roelofs believes Berea's model can be influential - if state governments provide more funds to the public universities, where 80% of US students attend. ""I do think there could be a Berea in every state,"" Roelofs says. ""There's only one and it's in Kentucky, but in every state there are kids who, you look at them, and you say, 'boy, they deserve a better chance than they're getting'."" For Sophie, that chance was ""one in a million"".""If this opportunity were taken away from me, I don't know where I would end up, I don't know what gutter I'd be sitting in,"" she says. ""This school means the world to me."" Now, as a first year student at the school she calls her ""unicorn"", Sophie is studying physics, singing in a choir and performing beat poetry in a school pageant hosted by the Black Student Union. After, she hopes to become a doctor - obstetrics and gynaecology - meaning four years of medical school, she says.""Which, hopefully I'll be able to afford."" ."
Trump: Democrats' impeachment push 'unpatriotic',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50635902,"US President Donald Trump has attacked Democrats' impeachment investigation into his conduct as ""very unpatriotic"".Speaking at a Nato summit in London, he said the congressional inquiry was a ""bad thing for our country"".""I'm not even thinking about it,"" the Republican president insisted of the impeachment drama.A US House of Representatives panel is to release a report on Tuesday laying out the case to remove Mr Trump from office.Speaking beside Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I think it's very unpatriotic for the Democrats to put on a performance where they do that. ""I do. I think it's a bad thing for our country. Impeachment wasn't supposed to be used that way.""Mr Trump also denied that the impeachment hearings had weakened his negotiating position at the Nato summit marking the Western military alliance's 70th anniversary. In a later meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mr Trump warned ""crazy"" Democrats to be careful about a time when the ""shoe is on the other foot"".""Someday, hopefully in the very long distant future, you'll have a Democrat president,"" he said, ""you'll have a Republican House and they'll do the same thing because somebody picked an orange out of a refrigerator and you don't like it. So let's go and impeach them."" The House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote along party lines on Tuesday evening to approve its report summing up the evidence against President Trump.The report will be submitted to the House Judiciary Committee, which will start its own proceedings on Wednesday, hours before Mr Trump is due to return to Washington.The judiciary panel's hearings will begin with four constitutional scholars, who will explain how impeachment works.The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, citing a lack of ""fairness"".Ahead of the intelligence committee's report, House Republicans released their own 123-page report that condemned the ""unelected bureaucrats"" who testified, saying they ""fundamentally disagreed with President Trump's style, world view and decisions"". The document accuses Democrats of ""trying to undo the will of the American people"" and argues that they have been trying to depose the president since his first day in office.""None of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanours,"" it argues, in reference to the constitutional clause that permits the removal of a president.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff dismissed the Republican rebuttal, saying it was ""intended for an audience of one"", Mr Trump, and ""ignores voluminous evidence""against him.In London, Mr Trump slammed Mr Schiff by name, calling him ""a maniac"", ""a very sick man"" and ""a deranged human being"".""I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious,"" the US president said.Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips - $400m (¬£309m) of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting with Ukraine's new leader. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power.The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into one of his main Democratic challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president.The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and the US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016.Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office.If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial.A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber.Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted.President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached."

"ANALYSIS: Democrats opt to 'keep it simple, stupid'",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50732900,"Ever since Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she was instructing the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, speculation swirled as to what exactly they would look like. Would they be broad, sweeping in a hodgepodge of alleged presidential misdeeds that include evidence gathered over the course of Mr Trump's three-year presidency? Or would they go narrow, and focus primarily on this latest Ukraine controversy.Now we have our answer. Narrow it is.Democrats probably decided to, as the saying goes, ""keep it simple, stupid"". They have what they hope will be an easy to understand case of presidential abuse of power, by using the vast tools of foreign policy at his disposal for personal political gain. As a backstop to these charges, they are accusing the president of attempting to obstruct Congress's investigation by denying relevant documents and witness testimony.At stake, they will argue, is the security of the 2020 presidential election and the protection of congressional authority as a co-equal branch of government.The main script from here appears clear - a quick vote in the Judiciary Committee, followed by one on the floor of the House of Representatives; presidential impeachment and a Senate trial.In the meantime, much to the consternation of some liberals, congressional Democrats will move to hand the president a policy victory - by approving his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And during all of this, a fever of allegations and accusations continue to swirl and threaten to erupt and disrupt the process in one way or another. There's claims of intelligence agency misconduct in its investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential Twitter barbs at his own FBI director, criminal investigations of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and much more. While the main script may be clear, beneath the surface unpredictability is the only predictable result."
Released US records reveal Pompeo-Giuliani contact,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50527849,"The US State Department has released records relating to the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.Documents were released to the ethics watchdog American Oversight after a freedom of information request.The records show repeated contacts between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.US ties with Ukraine are at the centre of an impeachment investigation against Mr Trump.The president is accused of withholding aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress to pressure the country into investigating his political rival Joe Biden. Mr Trump has declared the inquiry a ""witch hunt"" and denies any wrongdoing.Mr Giuliani has been accused of trying to discredit former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch while running a shadow US foreign policy on Ukraine. There have been questions over what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo knew.The records show Mr Pompeo and Mr Giuliani repeatedly spoke to one another - although the topics of those conversations remain unknown. Emails among the documents suggest the pair spoke on the phone on 27 and 29 March. The second call came after Mr Giuliani's staff emailed a personal assistant to President Trump, Madeleine Westerhout, to ask if she had a phone number for Mr Pompeo. Ms Yovanovitch was dismissed as ambassador to Ukraine in May.""We can see why Mike Pompeo has refused to release this information to Congress. It reveals a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani's smear campaign against a US ambassador,"" said American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers in a statement.""This is just the first round of disclosures. The evidence is only going to get worse for the administration as its stonewall strategy collapses in the face of court orders.""Ms Yovanovitch testified to the impeachment inquiry last week that she was fired over ""false claims"" by people with ""questionable motives"". She believes her anti-corruption efforts angered influential Ukrainians who then sought to remove her.The president attacked her in a tweet while she was giving her testimony. The diplomat said it was ""very intimidating"".President Trump again attacked Ms Yovanovitch in a phone call to Fox News on Friday, saying she ""wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy"" and ""was not an angel"".But a letter dated 5 April included in the document cache - signed by six former US ambassadors to Ukraine - expresses concern about the allegations against Ms Yovanovitch, describing them as ""simply wrong"".""Ambassador Yovanovitch... has a flawless record as a diplomat,"" the letter reads. ""She is a professional of the highest integrity.""The US president is accused of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating a domestic political rival.At the heart of the inquiry is a phone call on 25 July this year between Mr Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president.On the call, Mr Trump urged his counterpart to look into unsubstantiated corruption claims against Democratic White House contender Joe Biden.Mr Giuliani has been central in pushing those allegations. He has been subpoenaed for documents by impeachment investigators but has previously said he won't co-operate with Democrats.Mr Trump's critics say this alleged political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounted to abuse of power.

US naval base gunman 'had filed complaint',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695766,"The Saudi gunman who killed three sailors at a Florida naval base had lodged an official complaint against one of his instructors, reports say.Mohammed Alshamrani is said to have been ""infuriated"" after the instructor referred to him using a disparaging nickname in front of 10 other students. The FBI says it is treating Friday's attack, in which the gunman was shot dead, as a presumed terrorist attack.Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis called for more stringent security measures.Mr DeSantis said the gunman had ""a major social media trail"".""This guy was somebody who just had a deep-seated hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that,"" he said.""My view is that... for us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country.""The FBI is looking into whether Alshamrani acted alone or acted as part of a group. Special agent Rachel Rojas said other Saudi students at the Pensacola base had been questioned but not arrested. They were reportedly confined to the base and are co-operating with investigators.The instructor had referred to Alshamrani as ""Porn Stash"", the New York Times reports, quoting communication between people involved in flight training. ""I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,"" he is said to have written in his complaint.The jibe is understood to have suggested his moustache resembled those worn by some porn actors.Ms Rojas said Alshamrani, 21, had bought his weapon, a 9mm handgun, legally in the US. It has been reported in US media that Alshamrani played mass-shooting videos to others at a dinner earlier in the week, according to an anonymous official briefed on the investigation.A Twitter user appearing to match Alshamrani's identity also made a series of anti-US posts before the shooting, an online monitoring group says.The victims of the attack have been named as Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, and Cameron Scott Walters, 21.The US Navy said the sailors ""showed exceptional heroism and bravery in the face of evil"".The Pensacola base has long offered aviation training to foreign military forces.Saudi pilots started training there in 1995, alongside other personnel from Italy, Singapore and Germany. Some 200 international students are enrolled in programmes there. According to its website, the base employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel.Alshamrani was a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force.Earlier, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper ordered a review of the screening process for foreign military personnel in the US.Mr Esper told Fox News Sunday he had instructed top defence officials to look into security measures at bases.President Donald Trump has also pledged to review foreign military programmes.Authorities were alerted to the shooting at the Pensacola base at 06:51 (11:51 GMT). It took place across two floors of a classroom building and ended when a sheriff's deputy killed Alshamrani.Eight people were also injured in the shooting, including two officers, who are expected to recover.Family members of Joshua Kaleb Watson said he was shot several times but made it out of the building to alert first responders.On Facebook, his brother Adam Watson wrote: ""He died a hero and we are beyond proud but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.""Capt Tim Kinsella, the base's commanding officer, said of the three sailors killed: ""When confronted, they didn't run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives.""Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East and President Trump said the Saudi king called him after the attack to ""express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed"".Just as he did in the wake of the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country's consulate in Istanbul, President Trump is seeking to play down the significance of the Pensacola shooting. For a president who largely sees foreign policy in transactional terms, Saudi Arabia is a great customer for the US. Billions of dollars in weapons sales translates into more than 5,500 temporary visas being issued to the Saudi military to come to the US.Saudi personnel make up about 16% of the foreign personnel being trained at US military schools and other facilities. The Pensacola shooting is already raising questions about the vetting of these individuals. But more broadly it once again highlights the long-standing relationship between Washington and Riyadh - a relationship that many critics in Congress see as increasingly dubious in the wake of the Khashoggi murder and the Saudi military onslaught in Yemen.

Saudi king condemns 'barbaric' US base shooting,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695797,"Saudi Arabia's King Salman condemned a gun attack at a US naval base by a Saudi student as ""barbaric"", President Donald Trump said.He tweeted that the monarch had called him to offer ""sincere condolences"".The gunman, an aviation student, killed three people and injured at least eight at the base in Pensacola, Florida, before being shot dead. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Saudi government was ""going to owe a debt"" to the victims.The attacker has been named by US media as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani. He used a handgun during the shooting.The FBI are yet to declare a motive but are believed to be investigating for links to terrorism.""There are many reports circulating, but the FBI deals only in facts,"" special agent Rachel  Rojas told a news conference on Friday night.Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East and the two countries have longstanding military exchange programmes. The shooting has already prompted questions about the vetting of foreign military personnel sent to the US for training.It is the second shooting to take place at a US military base this week.A US sailor shot dead two workers at the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii on Wednesday.""King Salman of Saudi Arabia just called to express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed and wounded in the attack,"" President Trump tweeted.""The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people.""In a separate statement, the Saudi foreign ministry called the attack ""horrific"" and said it would provide ""full support"" to the investigation.President Trump has maintained close relations with Saudi leaders despite the killing of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who wrote a column for the Washington Post newspaper, in the country's consulate in Turkey in October 2018.Saudi officials have said Khashoggi, a high-profile critic of the government in Riyadh, was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents. But many critics believe otherwise and a UN expert concluded that the death was an ""extrajudicial execution"". Authorities were alerted to the shooting in a classroom at the base on the waterfront south-west of Pensacola at 06:51 local time (12:51 GMT) on Friday.The assault ended when a sheriff's deputy shot dead the attacker. Two officers were shot in the limbs but are expected to recover.""Walking through the crime scene was like being on the set of a movie,"" said Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan.According to its website,  Naval Air Station Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel.Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani was a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force in training at the site, US officials say.  There are reports that he posted an online manifesto before the attack but this is yet to be confirmed.Several Saudi nationals were detained near the scene of the shooting, the New York Times reported, citing unnamed sources. According to the US Navy, there had in recent weeks been 18 Saudi naval aviators and two aircrew members training at Pensacola.An investigation was taking place and names of victims would not be released until next of kin had been notified, it said in a statement.""There's obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi air force and then to be here training on our soil,"" said Gov DeSantis. ""Obviously the government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims and I think they're going to owe a debt here, given that this was one of their individuals,"" he added. Senator Rick Scott, the ex-governor of Florida, called for a review of training programmes for foreign military personnel on US soil.""We shouldn't be providing military training to people who wish us harm,"" he said.The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said he wanted to make sure that vetting was adequate. ""I want to make sure that we're doing our due diligence to understand: What are our procedures? Is it sufficient?"" he told reporters. Meanwhile Saudi officials have continued to condemn the attack, including vice-minister of defence, Khalid bin Salman, who said he trained at a US base like many others in the Saudi military.A large number of Saudi graduates of the Naval Air Station in Pensacola moved on to serve with their U.S counterparts in battlefronts around the world, helping to safeguard the regional and global security. Today's tragic event is strongly condemned by everyone in Saudi ArabiaEnd of Twitter post  by @kbsalsaudTimothy Kinsella, the base commanding officer, earlier said he was ""absolutely in awe"" of the response to the attack. ""There was some real heroism today,"" he said. ""I'm devastated. We are in shock. This is surreal, but I couldn't be prouder to wear the uniform that I wear because of my brothers and sisters in uniform, civilian or otherwise, that did what they did today to save lives."""
The movement to limit Spanish speaking in US,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50550742,"There are an estimated 41 million Spanish speakers in the US and that number is increasing. Yet there is also a small but vocal movement to restrict the spread of Spanish.""This is a country where we speak English. It's English. You have to speak English!"" Donald Trump often said during his 2016 US presidential campaign.The then presidential candidate made this point to cater to his supporters but he also used it as a strategy against some of his adversaries in the race for Republican Party nomination.One particular target was rival and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who sometimes expressed himself in Spanish.Mr Trump's tough approach to immigration paid off among sectors of the electorate that somehow share his opinion that ""in the  United States you have to speak English"".However, Mr Trump's demand has no legal basis: the US has no official language.Videos on social networks show people criticising others for speaking Spanish in public places.The message of these videos is clear. If you are in this country, you have to speak its language.Those viral attacks generally do not occur against tourists who speak Dutch, French or Italian, for example. They are usually directed against people who speak Spanish and who, because of their work or simply because of their physical appearance, are classified as immigrants.""These reactions against people who speak Spanish are probably not new,"" Heidi Beirich, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), tells BBC Mundo. ""But Donald Trump unleashed feelings that were not expressed publicly so often before.""The SPLC monitors hate groups in the US, which they define as any organisation that - based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities - has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.In this sense, the SPLC qualifies as hate groups several organisations that it considers anti-immigrant, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Washington DC-based Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Also on their list is ProEnglish, which advocates for English to be designated as the official language of the United States. All of them were created in recent decades by John Tanton, a white American far-right nationalist, who died in July of this year. Mr Tanton founded at least 12 anti-immigrant organisations, six of which have been designated hate groups by the SPLC.The aforementioned ProEnglish is one of the main organisations pushing the ""English Only"" movement, also known as ""English First"" or ""Official English"" movement.Part of ProEnglish's official platform states: ""In a pluralistic nation such as ours, the function of government should be to foster and support the similarities that unite us, rather than institutionalise the differences that divide us.""The organisation focuses its efforts on lobbying to convince legislators and public opinion of the need to adopt English as an official language at all levels of government.In addition, the group calls for an end to bilingual education in favour of language immersion programs in English in American public schools.While ProEnglish establishes on its website that ""the right to use other languages must be respected"", the group has been criticised by those who consider their agenda to be discriminatory.""They are careful to be called ProEnglish and not 'anti-Spanish'. But it is clear that their ideology is supremacist, referring to English as a symbol of US cultural heritage when this country has never been a project only in English,"" says SPLC researcher Heidi Beirich.Another of the organisations that stands out in the campaign to make English the official language is US English, founded in 1983 by Democratic Senator SI Hayakawa, who was of Japanese ancestry.Its members say they have nothing against people who speak languages other than English, but they think that immigrants who know English are more successful and can carve out a better future in the US.They also consider that the translation costs that government agencies incur on could be invested in other matters.BBC Mundo tried unsuccessfully to interview representatives from ProEnglish and US English.The discussion about English as an official language in the US is not new.In 1753, US founding father Benjamin Franklin expressed his fears that the growing population of immigrants of German descent would make English a minority language. In the early 1900s, US President Theodore Roosevelt stated his belief. ""We only have room for one language in this country, and it is English.""During the 1960s Civil Rights movement, the US Congress passed several laws that guaranteed citizens' access to essential public documents - such as ballots - in languages other than English. But at the same time, nationalist and English Only movements gained strength.Geoff Pullum, professor of general linguistics at the University of Edinburgh and co-author of the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, says there are two broad issues.""One about whether English should be made the official language of government by law and one about whether use of or teaching in languages other than English should be made illegal. ""It is truly amazing that both these dreadful and stupid ideas are still alive. They should have died in the 1980s. If it is made merely a law that English should be used for government, then one day when the population of New Mexico or Arizona or California has reached 51% Hispanic, a law could be passed to override that!""Attempts to make bilingual classrooms illegal defy research in educational sociolinguistics, he warns.""It has been found through careful testing that accepting bilingualism or bidialectalism in the classroom, and transitioning students gently toward the standard language or dialect, works better, much better, than proscribing rival languages or dialects,"" he says.He believes the ""English Only"" movement is driven mostly by hostility towards immigrants and their languages and cultures.Currently, 32 US states have English as the official language. Basically this means that the governments of those states have to offer all their information and documentation in English.But similarly, state governments are obliged to provide information in other languages when it comes to health or public safety issues.As for the federal government, all attempts to make English the official language by law have failed. Since 2005, Republican Congressman Steve King has submitted every two years the English Language Unity Act to the US Congress.But the bill has never obtained the necessary legislative support.That does not prevent the promoters of the idea from continuing to raise their voice.""The attacks that we now see on people who speak Spanish were already happening before,"" says Ms Beirich.""But when you are the subject of such an attack and you know that millions of people share your attacker's vision, including the president of the United States, you feel much more vulnerable,"" she concludes.This article is part of ¬øHablas espa√±ol?, a BBC road trip around the US to show the power of the Spanish language and Latinos in the age of Trump.

Trump's Ukraine conduct impeachable - law experts,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50651514,"There is no doubt that President Donald Trump's actions require him to be removed from office, three scholars of US constitutional law have testified. The three experts described Mr Trump's efforts to solicit help from a foreign nation as a crime and accused him of obstructing justice.Four experts, three picked by Democrats and one by the Republicans, have been testifying in Congress. The fourth said Mr Trump's actions were wrong, but not impeachable.As the investigation entered a new phase, the experts testified to the House Judiciary Committee which began hearings aimed at drawing up articles of impeachment. Its hearings come hot on the heels of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation, which concluded on Tuesday with a 300-page report accusing Mr Trump of putting his own personal political interests ""above the national interests of the United States"" by soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 US elections. The impeachment process began in September after an anonymous whistleblower complained to Congress about a July phone call by Mr Trump to the president of Ukraine, in which Mr Trump appeared to tie US military assistance to Ukraine launching investigations which would help him politically.The White House has rejected the allegations made by Democrats, who hold the majority in the House of Representatives. Mr Trump questioned the patriotism of Democrats, asking: ""Do they love our country?"" Among formal impeachment charges expected to be considered by the judiciary committee are abuse of power, obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress. Democrats are keen to hold a vote on impeachment in the House of Representatives before the end of the year, with the prospect of a trial in the Senate perhaps as early as January 2020.The four law professors questioned by the committee were:The legal experts interpreted the impeachment clause of the constitution, which allows for presidents to be removed from office due to ""high crimes and misdemeanours"".Prof Feldman testified that the ""evidence clearly constitutes"" an impeachable offence because Mr Trump's interactions with Ukraine show him ""corruptly using the powers of the presidency for personal political gain"".As she began her testimony, Prof Karlan scolded the committee's top Republican, saying she was ""insulted"" by his comment implying that she had not reviewed the intelligence committee's public testimony of 12 witnesses.""I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one"" of the witnesses, she said. ""But everything I read on those occasions tells me that when President Trump invited, indeed demanded, foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart what makes this a republic to which we pledge allegiance.""Mr Trump has attacked the ""safeguards against establishing a monarchy in this country"", Prof Gerhardt stated. ""The president's serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favour from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,"" he said in his opening remarks.""If what we're talking about here is not impeachable, nothing is impeachable,"" he added.Prof Turley, who was chosen as a witness by Republicans, said he disagreed with Mr Trump's conduct but ""this is not how an American president should be impeached"". He also warned that Democrats are setting a dangerous precedent.""I get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad...."" he said. ""We are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?""For Americans nostalgic about their days in law school, or perhaps wondering what it is like to sit through a professorial lecture, Wednesday morning's impeachment hearings were a treat. For the rest? Well, network TV was airing the Wendy Williams Show, with guests Morris Day and celebrity chef Jacques Torres.Those who did tune in heard noted legal scholars opine about the history and nature of presidential impeachment from the time of the Founding Fathers to the present.Democrats - because they have a majority on the committee - selected three of the participants. Not surprisingly, they all agreed that Donald Trump's conduct constituted impeachable offences. Jonathan Turley, picked by the Republicans, acknowledged that the president's actions were far from ""perfect,"" but lamented the anger in American politics and warned that action in this case would dangerously lower the bar for impeachable conduct for future presidents. It wasn't exactly the full-throated defence the president enjoys from his political allies.The stated task for the judiciary committee in the coming days will be to determine whether the facts established in the earlier intelligence committee hearings constitute impeachable acts. That's what the professors were there to help accomplish. In reality, it seems the minds of most on the committee - as with the witnesses - are already made up. The real drama on Wednesday occurred behind closed doors, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a private meeting with her fellow House Democrats to determine a path forward. With all signs pointing toward presidential impeachment as a probable outcome, the big question could be what articles of impeachment look like and the timing for their presentation.With public opinion on the matter fairly set along partisan lines, that more than anything, could decide how this process plays out in the days ahead.Democrats say Mr Trump dangled two bargaining chips to Ukraine - $400m (¬£309m) of military aid that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for President Volodymyr Zelensky - to obtain the investigations. They think this political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounts to an abuse of power.The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into former Vice-President Joe Biden, his main Democratic challenger, and his son Hunter. Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company when Joe Biden was US vice-president.The second Trump demand was that Ukraine try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016.Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office.If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial.A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber.Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted.President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached."
Do apostrophe's still matter?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50692797,"A man who led the war on improper use of apostrophes now admits defeat, saying his grammar vigilante campaign has been brought to an end by a culture of carelessness. So what now?The battle is over, bad grammar (as in headline above) has won. That was the message of retired journalist John Richards, who announced the end of his 18-year campaign to preserve the proper use of the apostrophe last month.""We have done our best but the ignorance and laziness present in modern times has won,"" the 96-year-old wrote.Richards founded The Apostrophe Protection Society in 2001 to defend the ""much abused punctuation mark"", waging war against advertisements for ""ladies fashions"", or the much maligned grocer's apostrophe, used to sell apple's and pear's. ""When I first set it up I would get about 40 emails or letters a week from people all over the world,"" Richards told the BBC. ""But then two years ago it started to tail off and nowadays I hardly get anything."" The misuse of an apostrophe can have an outsized impact. A new holiday in Ghana - Founders' Day - incited heated debate this year over the nation's history, focused squarely on the placement of punctuation.Whether the country should honour a singular founder (Founder's Day) or a group (Founders' Day) strikes at the heart of Ghana's independence legacy, and hinges on precise use of the apostrophe. ""It can distort truth,"" says Roslyn Petelin, a writing professor at the University of Queensland, Australia, of a misplaced mark. Richards' own pursuit of the apostrophe's proper use saw similar setbacks, with municipalities in the UK, Australia and the US banning apostrophes from street signs - a decision Richards branded ""absurd"".So what does Richards' abandoned society say about the state of grammar today? Is he tapping into a wider sense of texting-fuelled grammar apathy? Maybe not. The demise of The Apostrophe Society itself - an apparent loss to grammarians everywhere - sparked a renewed defence of the punctuation mark. ""It stirred up a real interest in the apostrophe,"" says Petelin, who says she received ""hundreds"" of messages on the apostrophe society after its closure, most proclaiming its lasting importance. The Apostrophe Society reported a 600-fold increase in demand after Richards announced its end - exceeding the server's bandwidth and effectively crashing the site, which will reopen in January ""for reference and interest"".  ""It's a quaint idea,"" Petelin says of the society. ""I'd mention it to my students more or less as a joke."" But Petelin, like Richards, is a staunch defender of the apostrophe as ""the 27th letter of the alphabet"", necessary for clear communication. ""Its correct use avoids bewilderment, confusion, consternation, and irritation to readers who know and love the apostrophe, as I do,"" she wrote for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation last year. ""I wouldn't call myself an outright pedant, but I do think where it's proper to be correct, one should be,"" she says. ""There's a certain kind of person who's really interested in apostrophes and commas,"" Petelin says. ""I think it's people who like to defend correctness."" And the apostrophe, perhaps more than any other punctuation mark, has long claimed devoted disciplines, including the self-proclaimed Grammar Vigilante of Bristol. But some grammar experts have a different perspective on a ""defence of correctness"" - like that taken up by Richards.""I see no need for an apostrophe society,"" says Anne Curzan, an English professor and dean of literature, science and arts at the University of Michigan. ""The society works from an idea where there is a stable system that has decayed in recent years,"" she says. But, ""the apostrophe is slippery and has been its entire life in English"".To Curzan, self-styled apostrophe police can have a more harmful impact than simply improving grammar. ""People will sometimes use the judgment of punctuation as a way to judge other people or win an argument,"" she says, even in disputes about sports or arts - arenas unrelated to grammar. ""Somehow you're not smart because you misplaced an apostrophe according to standard usage,"" Curzan says. ""It's a total power move."" She adds: ""If we're all honest about it - every single one of us have messed up our 'its' and our 'it's'. It's confusing."" Both Curzan and Petelin say the end of The Apostrophe Society is not the end of good grammar.Even in the age of texting, abbreviations and emojis, young people ""are paying very close attention to the details of language"", Curzan says. ""Texting is a place where young people have repurposed punctuation,"" she says. Punctuation in texting - a period at the end of a message or one exclamation mark versus two - carries real weight. ""It's very nuanced."" And both experts agree that the use of the apostrophe - like all punctuation - can be tricky. ""Language is not black and white,"" Petelin says. ""Punctuation is about two-thirds rules, one-third taste."" "
Canadian islanders angry over US mail searches,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49901455,"Campobello, a small Canadian island on the southwestern tip of New Brunswick, is only accessible year-round by bridge from the US state of Maine. US Customs agents have recently begun intercepting mail sent by Canada's postal agency to the island, leaving residents frustrated - and worried about their privacy. It was late summer when packages began arriving at the post office in the Campobello village of Welshpool with bright green labels declaring they'd been inspected by US customs. Packages, envelopes, it didn't matter, they were checked at the border.  ""Anything that arrives at the border is subject to being searched - that means anything,"" postmaster Kathleen Case told the BBC.Some days every item of mail - which are placed in a bonded truck in Canada and then sent about 80km (50 miles) through Maine and over the international Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge to Campobello - is inspected. Some packages have been seized. ""Here we are, a symbol of US-Canada friendship, and this is going on,"" says resident Steve Hatch. The former journalist has lodged a complaint with Canada Post, arguing the security of the mail destined for the island's 800 residents is being compromised and their privacy unprotected. ""Anything you order, [US border patrol agents] are going to know about,"" Mr Hatch told the BBC. It's not just Mr Hatch who's frustrated. There are confidentiality concerns about private medical and financial documents sent via the post. Some residents say there have been long delays in getting their packages delivered, inspected or not. And there are worries that someone could receive mail or a package with content that could get them banned from entering the US.  Cannabis New Brunswick, the government-run marijuana retailer, has temporarily halted the deliveries to the island. Both recreational and medical cannabis is legal in Canada but remain banned under US federal law. A November council meeting was ""tumultuous, sometimes rancorous"" as residents expressed frustration at the mail issue with their municipal politicians, reported The Quoddy Tides, a Maine-based newspaper that covers the region. The region's Conservative MP, John Williamson, says he'll be raising the issue in Ottawa when Parliament returns. ""It's not just a small matter dealing with people's Christmas cards [being looked at],"" he says. ""It's pushing on Canada's sovereignty."" New Brunswick's intergovernmental affairs department said it had concerns with respect to privacy issues and will be reaching out to the federal government as well. Campobello Island is home to the Roosevelt Campobello International Park, named after the former American President Franklin Roosevelt who spent holidays sailing, swimming, and fishing on the bucolic island, once popular as summer resort destination for wealthy families along the east coast. The park is an enduring symbol of the relationship between the United States and Canada, countries that share the longest undefended border in the world and deep economic, cultural and diplomatic ties. The bridge that connects Campobello to the fishing village of Lubec, Maine was built in 1962 and since then has been the only option for islanders to travel into Canada for most of the year.  A private ferry brings Canadian passengers to the island during the summer months. Campobello residents cross into the US regularly for everything from filling up their car with petrol - Campobello has no bank, gas station, or hospital - to driving an hour through Maine to New Brunswick for access to government and medical services. ""Since that bridge was built the very viability of Campobello Island I has hinged on that goodwill between the US and Canada - the common understanding that people from Campobello have to drive through the states to get back from Canada,"" says island resident Justin Tinker. ""That common goodwill was there - until now it isn't."" He says the mail inspections mean ""you're throwing away half of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because you can't receive a package in the mail without unjust search forfeiture"". Why is this happening?It's unclear. Some think Canada's legalisation of recreational cannabis last year prompted the change.US Customs and Border Protection hasn't confirmed that's the case. It released a statement saying the agency's officers possess broad search authority to ensure the safety and admissibility of all goods entering the US. ""This includes the ability to inspect and search all persons, baggage and merchandise arriving in - and transiting through - the United States,"" says spokesman Michael McCarthy. Canada Post confirmed that US agents have the right to stop and search any truck at their discretion and detain or seize inadmissible items - and says it's working on a solution.  Dale Calder, a lifelong resident of Campobello is also a retired Canadian border agent. He's had six packages inspected so far, which ""personally infuriates me"", he says. He recalled something similar happening in the late 1990s but it was quickly dealt with at the time by Canadian officials. Twenty years later it's an issue again. Ms Case says Canada Post has helped her ensure mail is delivered to residents when the green US inspection stickers cover the address labels - a frequent occurrence. But she says US agents are ""well within their right"" to search the mail.""Realistically, we're lucky they're letting anything come at all,"" the postmaster says. ""I don't want to put it on them. We're very fortunate they're providing us with a way to get anything here. There is no other way. If it weren't for the US, we'd get nothing. We're completely dependent on them."" Residents the BBC spoke to tended to agree - the border agents are doing their job - but said the mail issue is just the latest frustration in growing hassles and delays they've been facing crossing the border. ‚ÄãMr Tinker is among the residents pushing for year-round ferry access to the island.  Supporters argue it would help them build a more self-sufficient community, boost the island's economy, and help prevent population decline. ""Campobello is the only place in Canada where you can't get there from here without going through the States,"" says Mr Tinker. ""That's become a tougher and tougher pill to swallow."" "
LA police to use 'Batman-style' restraint device,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50657989,"Two hundred Los Angeles police officers will be trained to use a new gadget designed to snare a person by wrapping them in a cord, officials say.The BolaWrap, recently adopted by several other forces, fires a cord that can entangle an individual's torso or legs from up to 25ft (8m) away.The tether is intended to restrict the person's movement, allowing officers to take action without using force.But civil rights activists have raised concerns over its potential usage.Three devices will be carried by officers in the southern Californian city as part of a 90-day trial starting in January.A total of 200 Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers will be given the devices after training, the force said.""If you deploy a wrap tool, it buys time for officers to deploy a secondary option,"" Bell Police Chief Carlos Islas said, according to the LA Times. ""It will inevitably restrain someone. It's a tool that's been a long time coming.""Mr Islas says the device will only be used in specific circumstances, including cases when individuals are suffering from mental health issues. It is one of many tools used by officers and may not work in every situation, Mr Islas says.Officers across the country face scrutiny for their use of force on unarmed individuals.John Raphling, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that the deployment of BolaWraps could lead to abuse.""Tools like these create the illusion that police enforcement is going to be less violent,"" said Mr Ralphing. ""The reality is that - as we've seen with tasers and other less lethal weapons - they will be used to expand police violence.""Rather than giving more power to police, we should be rethinking what the role of police is in our country.""Discussing the tool at a meeting with LA police, Adam Smith, member of Black Lives Matter, an activist movement, said it would probably be used mostly in minority communities, the LA Times reports.Wrap Technologies, the company that makes the gun-like gadget, describes it as ""a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges an 8ft bola style Kevlar tether"".At the end of the tether - fired at 513ft per second - are two small barbs that attach to a person when they make contact.""Suspects are restrained with minimal to no pain, while also enabling officers to swarm and investigate the situation,"" the company says on its website.Several police forces, including Fresno in California and Hendersonville in North Carolina, have been training their officers to use the BolaWrap on the streets.In October, a Fresno police officer used a BolaWrap gun to apprehend a man who had stabbed two people with a kitchen knife.Last month, Santa Cruz Sheriff's Office said it had bought 20 BolaWrap devices it hoped would prove to be ""another less-lethal force option to their tool-belt"".In US media, the gun-like device has been likened to a gadget used by comic book superhero Batman, who prefers non-lethal means when fighting crime.The device is one of several recent examples of police forces in the US testing new technologies for law enforcement purposes.Last month, Massachusetts State Police said it was using remote robot dogs to keep officers out of harm's way in potentially dangerous situations.A spokesman for the force said the robot, made by Boston Dynamics, was ""a valuable tool for law enforcement because of its ability to provide situational awareness of potentially dangerous environments"".The American Civil Liberties Union, a rights group, asked the force to explain how the robots were being used, raising concerns over transparency and potential racial injustice."
US rapper Juice Wrld dies aged 21,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50707164,"Juice Wrld, a US rapper who shot to fame on music streaming platforms, has died at the age of 21.Celebrity news website TMZ said he died after suffering a seizure at Chicago's Midway airport on Sunday morning. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said the cause was unknown.Juice Wrld, real name Jarad Anthony Higgins, was best-known for his viral 2018 hit Lucid Dreams. Mental health, mortality and drug use were common themes in his music. His record label, Interscope Geffen A&M Records, said Juice Wrld was an ""exceptional human being"" who ""made a profound impact on the world in such a short period of time"".Chicago police told the BBC a 21-year-old man suffered a medical emergency at around 02:00 local time (08:00 GMT) and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Sun Times there were ""no signs of foul play"" and it was unclear whether drugs played a role in his death.Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998, Juice Wrld was raised by his single mother, described as a religious and conservative woman who forbade him from listening to hip hop. He started rapping in high school, using online music streaming platform SoundCloud to upload and promote his music.Juice Wrld went on to release his debut full-length EP, 999, on the platform in 2017, garnering him attention from fellow Chicago-based artists such as G Herbo and Lil Bibby. The rapper rose to fame in 2018, when hit singles All Girls Are the Same and Lucid Dreams, which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, drew the attention of music fans and record labels.More plaudits followed the release of his first studio album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, in 2018, cementing him as one of the rising stars of US rap.In early 2018, he was signed by Interscope Records, landing a record deal reported to be worth more than $3m (¬£2.2m).

Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50652567,"In January Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign in front of a crowd of more than 20,000 on a sunny afternoon in Oakland, California. The event felt like the beginning of something big - a presidential campaign with money, national organisation and a young, charismatic candidate whose background was as diverse as the party she wanted to lead.On the steps of Oakland's City Hall, the former state attorney general and prosecutor from nearby San Francisco gave a speech full of lofty rhetoric, saying that the 2020 presidential election would be about the ""right to moral leadership"" of the entire planet.Now her campaign won't be around to see 2020, let alone the November general election.Pundits and analysts are already picking apart Harris's campaign strategy and perceived missteps over the past months. She tried to walk a line between the moderate and the progressive wings of her party and ended up appealing to neither. In a New York Times opinion piece published a few days before Harris announced her campaign, California-based law professor Lara Bazelon offered a blistering attack on Harris as being insufficiently supportive of progressive criminal justice reforms.""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail, and among left-leaning Democrats that label was not meant in a good way.Harris responded by tacking to the left on the campaign trail, but that ceded much of the middle ground to competitors like Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.Despite this, Harris surged to near-front-runner status after a clash with Joe Biden in the June debate. She squandered the momentum she gained, however, with muddled responses to questions on healthcare policy. Her subsequent debate performances were lacklustre. She initially ignored, then made a belated push, to campaign in first-voting Iowa. In a letter to her supporters, Harris attributed her decision to drop out of the race to a lack of funds.""I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign,"" she wrote, in a clear shot at two of her self-funding rivals, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. ""And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.""In the end, money is what does in most campaigns. And while Harris had posted solid fund-raising numbers in the first three quarters of 2019, her slow, steady decline in the polls and dimming electoral prospects must have been matched by dwindling donations. She had already abandoned much of her New Hampshire campaign infrastructure, but even that wasn't enough to keep her afloat.Meanwhile, the Democratic presidential race will grind on without Harris. Looking at her dismal national poll standing - around 4% according to an average of recent surveys -  the obvious answer to ""who benefits from her dropout?"" is ""no one."" But the withdrawal of the only California officeholder in the race puts delegate- and donor-rich California, whose primary is in early March, up for grabs. That is significant. Expect California to become a fierce battleground in the weeks ahead.At 55, Harris still has a long political career ahead of her. She would be an attractive vice-presidential pick for a candidate like Biden. While her first foray into national politics will be largely remembered for unmet expectations and missed opportunities, she has plenty of time for a second act."
New Jersey attack 'may be anti-Semitic terror',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50764276,"A gun attack on a Jewish supermarket in New Jersey is being investigated as domestic terrorism driven by anti-Semitism and hatred of police, officials say.The FBI is now overseeing the investigation into the attack in Jersey City, where four people were killed.Police shot two suspected attackers after a four-hour standoff.The suspects were identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.""The evidence points towards acts of hate,"" state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. ""We are investigating this matter as potential acts of domestic terror, fuelled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs.""He said the attackers had only fired on people in the supermarket and police officers.""You can see clearly from the video that the individuals that engaged, the cowards that took down those innocent victims, engaged only with folks in that store and the law enforcement community,"" Mr Grewal said.""You can see people that walked by, they didn't target them.""Mr Grewal said a pipe bomb had been recovered from the suspects' van, which had been equipped with bulletproof panels, along with five guns.Investigators had found a note at the scene, he added, but nothing that could be described as a manifesto had been found. Officials believe the suspects acted alone.US media have reported that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack.At least one of the suspects appeared to be interested in a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites, officials said. The group is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group.But Mr Grewal said no official link with the group had been established.Earlier Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city.""I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than four,"" he said. The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The pair killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, investigators said.Thy fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition.The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire.Mr Fulop told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop.The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers.The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured.They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutch, 24.""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five.""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short.""Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out.Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who had worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"", and ordered police to be on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area.""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference.He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously.""New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year.""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said."
The case for and against impeaching Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50663128,"Experts are debating what the US Constitution says about impeachment, in light of the ongoing inquiry into President Donald Trump's alleged abuse of power involving Ukraine. So what did they say?The US Constitution provides in Article II, Section 4, that the president, the vice-president and all civil officers, may be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"".But what that actually means has long been a subject of debate.On Wednesday, four constitutional lawyers appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to give their view - three called by the Democrats and one by Republicans.It marks a new phase of the impeachment inquiry as the committee considers drawing up articles of impeachment - in effect, a charge sheet. After a president is impeached in the House of Representatives, the Senate then votes on conviction and removal from office.In this case, the US president is accused of an abuse of power in trying to extract political favours from Ukraine by withholding military aid and a White House meeting with Ukraine's leader.But does that deserve impeachment and possible subsequent removal from office? Here's what the legal scholars said.President Trump's conduct described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanour under the Constitution. According to the testimony and to the publicly released memorandum of the July 25, 2019, telephone call between the two presidents, President Trump abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election. This act on its own qualifies as an impeachable high crime and misdemeanour. Noah Feldman, Harvard Law SchoolThe president's serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favour from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing.When we apply our constitutional law to the facts found in the Mueller Report and other public sources, I cannot help but conclude that this president has attacked each of the Constitution's safeguards against establishing a monarchy in this country. Both the context and gravity of the president's misconduct are clear: The ""favour"" he requested from Ukraine's president was to receive - in exchange for his release of the funds Ukraine desperately needed - Ukraine's announcement of a criminal investigation of a political rival. The investigation was not the important action for the president; the announcement was because it could then be used in this country to manipulate the public into casting aside the president's political rival because of concerns about his corruption. Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of LawWouldn't you know in your gut that such a president had abused his office, betrayed the national interest and tried to corrupt the electoral process? I believe the evidentiary record shows wrongful acts on that scale here. It shows a president who delayed meeting a foreign leader and providing assistance that Congress and his own advisers agreed served our national interest in promoting democracy and limiting Russian aggression. And it shows a president who did this to strong-arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the president's opponents in our ongoing election season.Based on the evidentiary record, what has happened in the case before you is something that I do not think we have ever seen before: a president who has doubled down on violating his oath to ""faithfully execute"" the laws and to ""protect and defend the Constitution"". The evidence reveals a president who used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency.Pamela Karlan, Stanford Law SchoolPresident Trump will not be our last president and what we leave in the wake of this scandal will shape our democracy for generations to come. I am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. If the House proceeds solely on the Ukrainian allegations, this impeachment would stand out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president. That does not bode well for future presidents who are working in a country often sharply and, at times, bitterly divided.By Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law School and BBC contributorAnd he continued:I get it. You are mad. The president is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad... and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad. We are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration? That is why this is wrong. It is not wrong because President Trump is right. His call was anything but ""perfect"" and his reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate. It is not wrong because the House has no legitimate reason to investigate the Ukrainian controversy. The use of military aid for a quid pro quo to investigate one's political opponent, if proven, can be an impeachable offense. It is not wrong because we are in an election year. There is no good time for an impeachment, but this process concerns the constitutional right to hold office in this term, not the next. No, it is wrong because this is not how an American president should be impeached. For two years, members of this Committee have declared that criminal and impeachable acts were established for everything from treason to conspiracy to obstruction. However, no action was taken to impeach. Suddenly, just a few weeks ago, the House announced it would begin an impeachment inquiry and push for a final vote in just a matter of weeks.To do so, the House Intelligence Committee declared that it would not subpoena a host of witnesses who have direct knowledge of any quid pro quo. Instead, it will proceed on a record composed of a relatively small number of witnesses with largely second-hand knowledge of the position. The only three direct conversations with President Trump do not contain a statement of a quid pro quo and two expressly deny such a pre-condition.Democrats - because they have a majority on the committed - selected three of the participants. Not surprisingly, they all agreed that Donald Trump's conduct constituted impeachable offences. Jonathan Turley, picked by the Republicans, acknowledged that the president's actions were far from ""perfect,"" but lamented the anger in American politics and warned that action in this case would dangerously lower the bar for impeachable conduct for future presidents. It wasn't exactly the full-throated defence the president enjoys from his political allies.The stated task for the Judiciary Committee in the coming days will be to determine whether the facts established in the earlier Intelligence Committee hearings constitute impeachable acts. That's what the professors were there to help accomplish. In reality, it seems the minds of most on the committee - as with the witnesses - are already made up. By BBC North America reporter Anthony ZurcherTwo presidents were impeached and another resigned before his probable impeachment.But no president has ever been removed from office - that requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate.

Dancing star's son 'shamed for having two dads',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50642825,"A substitute teacher has been sacked from a school in Utah after allegedly berating the adopted son of Dancing With The Stars professional Louis van Amstel for having gay parents. Mr van Amstel accused the teacher of bullying his 11-year-old, who he is in the process of adopting.The teacher asked the class what they were thankful of for Thanksgiving.The boy said he was thankful for ""being adopted by his two dads"", according to Mr van Amstel. In response, the teacher allegedly said ""that's nothing to be thankful for"" and gave the class a lecture about homosexuality, Mr van Amstel said.The teacher has been fired by Kelly Services, the subcontracting company that hired her.Mr van Amstel, 47, vented his anger over the incident at a school in Cedar Hills, south of Salt Lake City, in a series of social media posts.The teacher, according to Mr van Amstel, told the boy that ""two men living together is a sin"".""The substitute teacher was giving her very clear opinion that two men is wrong, homosexuality is wrong,"" Mr van Amstel said.Three girls asked the teacher to stop, but when she did not, they complained to the principal, Mr van Amstel said.As the teacher was escorted from the school, she ""continued to argue her point"", school officials told Mr van Amstel.A spokesman for the Utah school district said ""appropriate action has been taken"".In a statement, Kelly Services said: ""We are concerned about any reports of inappropriate behaviour and take these matters very seriously.""We conducted an investigation and made the decision to end the employee's relationship with Kelly Services.""In January 2017, Mr van Amstel married his long-time boyfriend Joshua Lancaster in Sundance, Utah.

Cave diver says Elon Musk tweets 'humiliated' him,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50667553,"A British cave expert has testified that he was left feeling ""humiliated, ashamed"" and ""dirtied"" after Elon Musk labelled him ""pedo guy"" online.Vernon Unsworth is suing the Tesla founder for defamation.The diver, who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave last year, told a Los Angeles court that comments Mr Musk made were ""very hurtful"". The pair got into a public war of words after Mr Unsworth dismissed an offer of help from the billionaire. The case of the Thai boys, members of a football team who became trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand, captured the world's attention in June 2018.Mr Musk sent Tesla engineers and a small submarine to help free the boys during the Thai rescue effort - but it was never used. Mr Unsworth later labelled it a ""PR stunt"" and suggested the billionaire could ""stick his submarine where it hurts"" during an interview with CNN.Mr Musk - who has almost 30m Twitter followers - responded with a series of posts about Mr Unsworth including one where he labelled him ""pedo guy"".Mr Unsworth's legal team have described Mr Musk's now-deleted tweet as ""vile and false"" and are seeking unspecified punitive damages.US District Judge Stephen Wilson previously denied the defence's request to define Mr Unsworth as a ""public figure"" - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with ""actual malice"" to win the case.Mr Unsworth, who court reporters said appeared on the verge of tears, said he felt Mr Musk had branded him a paedophile.""It feels very raw. I feel humiliated. Ashamed. Dirtied,"" he told the court. ""Effectively, from day one, I was given a life sentence without parole. It hurts to talk about it,"" Mr Unsworth said.He described the tweet as ""very hurtful"" and said the experience had left him feeling ""very vulnerable"" and ""very isolated"".The experienced cave explorer, 64, splits his time between the UK and Thailand. During the rescue, he helped recruit experienced cave divers who were instrumental in freeing the boys safely.""I find it disgusting,"" Mr Unsworth said about Mr Musk's ""pedo"" comment. ""I find it very hard to even read the word, never mind talk about.""The Tesla and SpaceX founder testified across two days before Mr Unsworth took to the stand.During his testimony he apologised again to Mr Unsworth for the tweets, while insisting he posted them ""off the cuff"" and not in a serious manner.He told the court he had not expected the ""pedo"" tweet to be taken literally and at the time thought Mr Unsworth ""was just some random creepy guy"" who was ""unrelated to the rescue"".Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, testified in his opening statements that term ""pedo guy"" was a common insult in South Africa, where the billionaire grew up.During his testimony Mr Musk also played down other tweets, which were also later deleted, including one where he replied ""bet ya a signed dollar it's true"" to a follower asking about the ""pedo"" comment.Mr Musk also acknowledged in court that he paid $52,000 (¬£40,000) to a man posing as a private detective to dig up dirt about the British diver after it became clear he would be sued. The investigator turned out to be a conman, Mr Musk said.Under questioning on Wednesday, Mr Musk estimated his net worth to be about $20bn but insisted most of his wealth was held in stock.""Sometimes people think I have a lot of cash. I actually don't,"" he told the court."
California firm to pay $13.5bn to wildfire victims,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50697816,"Californian utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has agreed a $13.5bn (¬£10.2bn) settlement with victims of wildfires in the state.The company's equipment has been linked to several blazes including the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, 2018's Camp Fire.PG&E filed for bankruptcy this year and has already settled with insurers and local authorities.The agreements should allow the firm to emerge from bankruptcy. PG&E's settlement relates to claims over several deadly blazes:PG&E President Bill Johnson said since entering the bankruptcy process ""getting wildfire victims fairly compensated, especially the individuals, has been our primary goal.

OPINION: Evidence for impeachment thin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50722427,"The articles for impeachment unveiled by House Democrats against President Donald Trump suggest this is a party putting haste before justice, says law professor Jonathan Turley, who appeared before the judiciary committee last week as a Republican witness. For three years, Democratic members have pledged to unleash the dogs of impeachment to devour a president despised by their base.  Today, the doors finally opened and the public found itself staring not at a multi-headed Cerberus from Hades but a couple of underfed Chihuahuas.   In my testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week, I focused on the crimes like bribery that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff declared repeatedly were now well-established.  Those claims were legally unfounded and untenable, though the other witnesses and members vociferously insisted that they were clear and established.  The response was all too familiar. For three years, the same Democratic leadership told the public that a variety of criminal and impeachable acts were proven in the Mueller investigation.  None of those crimes are now part of this impeachment.  Why? Because it would have been too easy an impeachment? Hardly.Instead, the House will go forward on the only two plausible grounds that I outlined in my testimony - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Unlike the other claims, the problem is not with the legal basis for such impeachable offences but the evidentiary record.  This record remains both incomplete and conflicted. The Democrats have insisted on impeaching by Christmas rather than build a record to support such charges.  They have burned three months without trying to compel witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton.  That is longer than it took for the critical case in Nixon to go from the ruling in the district court to the Supreme Court for a final decision to force him to release the famous tapes.  Nixon resigned shortly after that ruling. This is now the fastest investigation with the thinnest record supporting the narrowest impeachment in modern history.  It is precisely what President Trump (who not surprisingly has supported the Democratic move for a fast impeachment) would relish.  This schedule driven more by the Iowa caucuses in February than impeachment criteria.  The Democrats just gave Trump the best Christmas gift he could hope for under these two circumstances - two anaemic Chihuahuas with barely the energy to make the walk over to the Senate.Jonathan Turley is professor of constitutional law at George Washington University"
Scorpion stings woman on United Airlines flight,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50701544,"A woman has been stung by a scorpion while travelling on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Atlanta.The woman says she felt a stinging sensation on her leg during the flight on Thursday morning. When she went to the toilet, the scorpion fell out of her trousers and scuttled away.The passenger was treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital, the airline told the BBC. She has not been named and her condition is not known.""After learning that one of our customers on flight 1554 from San Francisco to Atlanta was stung during flight, our crew responded immediately and consulted with a MedLink physician on the ground who provided medical guidance,"" the airline said in a statement. ""The customer was transported to a local hospital,"" it added.  ""We have been in contact with our customer to ensure her well-being.""A picture of the scorpion in what appears to be a United Airlines-branded box was published by celebrity news website TMZ, which first reported the story.Although rare, it's not the first time a scorpion has been found on a commercial flight.Earlier this year, a scorpion was filmed crawling out of the overhead luggage rack on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia.A similar incident happened in 2017, when a Canadian man said he was strung by a scorpion on a United Airlines flight. Richard Bell said the scorpion fell on his head from above him while he was eating lunch on a flight from Houston, Texas to Calgary in Canada.The airline offered Mr Bell flying credit as compensation, which he accepted. Later in 2017, an EasyJet flight from Paris to Glasgow was delayed overnight after a passenger spotted a scorpion on board."
Does UK election provide clues to Trump‚Äôs fortunes?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50717536,"All eyes in this week's UK election will be on constituencies like this one in North Wales, where Labour could lose power for the first time since 1935. Given that the Brexit vote in 2016 was followed by the election of Donald Trump months later, does the populist sentiment driving this change teach us anything about next year's US election?James Thomas, an ex-Marine who has lived in Wrexham his entire life, stands outside his town's football stadium at half-time and smokes a cigarette. Although he says his home has hit a bit of a lull, he thinks it has a bright future. Why he feels this way should deeply trouble the Labour Party faithful ahead of Thursday's general election. ""When the Conservatives come into power, they'll sort it all out,"" he says.The 35-year-old mechanical engineer says both he and his 70-year-old grandfather - lifetime Labour supporters - are planning on voting Tory for the first time this week, and there's one main reason. ""The Conservative Party will get Brexit done and get it out of the way, and then we'll move on,"" he says.Like 59% of the Wrexham constituency, Thomas voted Leave in the 2016 referendum on British membership in the European Union. He says he did so because he wanted to stem the flow of immigration into the country - and it's also why he's backing Boris Johnson over Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, whom he says ""hasn't got a clue"". ""I don't want to come across as negative toward the foreign people coming across,"" he says. ""If the foreign people coming across are doctors, then I'm all for that. But if they're coming across and just claiming all the taxes and all that and not working, then we should get rid of them.""Corbyn, he says, is ""all for the druggies, all the whiskey heads and all, giving money to the ones on the streets and all that"". ""What about us,"" Thomas asks, ""the people who actually work?""""Get Brexit Done"" is a common refrain for the Conservatives - a slogan plastered on billboards and signs that surround party leader Boris Johnson at the party's campaign events. The force of Johnson's personality, his iconoclastic manner, also has drawn voters like Thomas to the Conservatives, which he says is no longer the party for just the wealthy.""I tell all my friends that Boris Johnson will do what he says,"" he continues. ""He's exactly the same as Donald Trump. Donald Trump says he's going to do something, he'll do it.""Trump's 2016 supporters in the US said time and time again that his blunt truth-telling, even if it sometimes offended, was one of his most compelling attributes. It suggests the two Anglophone leaders have more in common than just their much-talked-about hair.Like Johnson, Trump also has an electoral slogan, ""Keep America Great,"" that suggests work still to be done. It is a call to his electoral coalition to once again put him over the top. There's no doubt Wrexham, a once thriving mining town in the north of Wales, has fallen on hard times. Unemployment is up. Poverty rates are rising. Drug addiction is a growing problem.Even on a Saturday night, the historic old downtown is largely empty, with people sleeping rough in the darkened alcoves of empty storefronts.The town still has its charm. The Pontcysyllte aqueduct, an elevated canal completed in 1805, is an engineering marvel. The local university, Wrexham Glyndwr, is expanding. And the town's football club, Wrexham AFC, with its long and storied history, is a source of local pride.The Red Dragons are the third-oldest professional football team in the world, with achievements that include winning the FA Trophy in 2013 and a stunning upset of defending champions Arsenal in a 1992 FA Cup third-round match.Like the town, however, the football club is currently struggling. While its stadium, the Racecourse Ground, is the oldest venue that still hosts international matches, it shows all of its 142 years. Many of the once bright-red seats have faded to a pale pink from exposure to the elements. The standing terrace, behind the east goal, is no longer open to the public and appears from a distance to be on the verge of a rusty collapse.The team itself has dropped out of the league and into the fifth tier of English football, teetering near the relegation zone once again.  In its heyday, the stadium held more than 34,000 to watch a 1957 match against Manchester United. On a blustery afternoon last Saturday, roughly 3,000 die-hard fans watched them take on Solihull Moors. Wrexham's parliamentary constituency is one of dozens held by the Labour Party that voted leave in 2016. Because the Conservative Party is firmly backing leave, while Labour is divided on the issue, these seats are being heavily targeted by the Tories as pick-up opportunities. Recent polling suggests the Conservatives may be on to something. According to an Economist survey conducted in late November, the Tories have an eye-popping lead over Labour in Wrexham, 44% to 29%.Victory in places like Wrexham - old, post-industrial towns and constituencies across central and northern UK - could hold the key for a Tory majority in Thursday's election. Much like the Democratic Party's ""Blue Wall"" of old industrial mid-western states in the US that chose Republican Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, Labour's ""Red Wall"" shows signs of cracking.  One doesn't have to look hard to see parallels. Like Wrexham, places such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio in the US were once the nation's industrial heartland, where coal mining, steel production and manufacturing provided a stable livelihood. Now much of the region is struggling with economic uncertainty, drug addiction and decaying urban centres.In 2016, voter dissatisfaction in the US mid-west, and in large swaths of the central and northern UK, gave rise to an electoral earthquake. First it was the June Brexit referendum, where a narrow majority of UK voters opted to leave the European Union. Five months later, it was Trump's similarly narrow victory. In one case it was a man who served as the hammer that forged an electoral realignment. In the other it was a single-issue vote. But at the heart of both was a conservative populism centred around trade and immigration. This week's UK general election is a key test to see whether 2016 was a sign of a durable political shift in the UK. And, like the 2016 Brexit vote, there will be many in the US watching carefully to see if British politics once again foreshadows events to come in the US. Even among Wrexham's Labour voters, there are signs of Brexit fatigue - and a desire to put the whole divisive ordeal behind them.""The country was given the opportunity to vote,"" says Erfyl Jones, a Wrexham supporter who came to Saturday's Wrexham match from nearby Denbigh. ""The people went out to vote. That result should be respected by everybody. We should move on.""On Sunday afternoon, Corbyn finished up a two-day campaign blitz through Wales that included three northern towns. He skipped Wrexham, however, opting to visit constituencies currently held by Conservatives.During his stump speeches, Corbyn barely mentioned Brexit at all, instead attacking the Tories for their post-recession austerity policies and a willingness, he says, to sacrifice the National Health Service in trade negotiations with the US.It's a reflection of the delicate position Labour finds itself in during these last days of the general election campaign. The party supports leaving the EU, but it wants to renegotiate the terms of the exit and then submit the results to another national vote. It's an attempt to please both the remain and the leave factions within the party, but it could end up satisfying neither.""Brexit has really divided people,"" says Lyndsey Lynch, a Labour activist from Holyhead who attended a Corbyn rally in Bangor on Sunday. ""Discussion has descended into name-calling, which is really disappointing.""She says the parts of the UK that voted leave did so to disrupt the status quo - a sentiment she understands.""People have been left behind,"" she says. ""They are feeling the pinch. People are more impoverished. It's very much understandable for them to say we're not having this anymore.""Across the Atlantic, even some Democrats will acknowledge that a similar sentiment - to send a message to the nation's governing class - was a significant reason for Trump's 2016 success. And there have been calls among Democrats to ""move on"" from Trump, and instead talk about issues - like healthcare, education and the environment - rather than simply campaign against the current White House resident.With Trump on the ballot in 2020, of course, that will be a challenge. Democrats in Congress are also on the verge of impeaching the president, forcing a Senate trial for only the third time in US history. And even though Corbyn is focusing on his own slate of issues, Brexit is still unresolved three years later, with whether and how to leave the EU continuing to be a source of anxiety and anger.At the Wrexham game on Saturday, Mark Thomas sits in the bleachers with a smile on his face. ""We're winning,"" he says. ""That's good news for a change.""A long-time Labour supporter, the lorry driver says he's not planning on voting on Thursday. ""I can't see anybody that's going to do any different,"" he says. ""The politicians will do what they want at the end of the day. They're not bothered about people sitting in this ground or any other.""Thomas voted remain, and says he isn't bothering to vote because the only parties firmly behind remain - the Liberal Democrats and the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru - have no chance of winning in Wrexham.If Labour hopes to hold off the Conservatives, it needs voters like Thomas, but he's probably not the only one who has decided to sit this election out. Thomas says the Wrexham voters who chose Leave didn't think things through. He understands, however, why they were confused.""There's a lot of scaremongering,"" he says. ""If we're going to come out of Europe, oh we're going to be trouble. If we stay in Europe, oh we're in trouble. People don't know what to think.""Beneath the stands, twin brothers Carl and Mark Davis swig beers and give voice to that confusion. While the ex-workers in the now-shuttered steel mill are dedicated Labour supporters, Carl voted Remain, while Mark chose Leave.""Vote Tory? I'd rather jump off the Eiffel Tower, if I can still get there,"" Mark says. ""But you have to look out for the working people.""On Thursday, Labour will have to rely on traditional party allegiances like those of the Davis brothers holding strong enough to keep places like Wrexham in its column, despite the tectonic shifts the Brexit referendum vote may be creating in British politics.Next year in the US, Democrats seek to win back the disaffected voters who switched to Republican in 2016. As many as nine million people who backed Barack Obama also voted for Trump.Mr Johnson's Conservative Party could be on the verge of creating a new electoral  constituency unlike any that came before it. In November 2020, Mr Trump will try to prove that his conservative populism was more than just a one-time blip - but likewise a sign of a governing coalition that can endure.In the US, the final verdict is 11 months off. In the UK, however, the results will land in just a few days.Follow Anthony on Twitter"
Trump denies press credentials to Bloomberg News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50637380,"The Trump campaign says it will refuse credentials to reporters with Bloomberg News, the outlet owned by Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg. After Mr Bloomberg's official entry to the 2020 race last week, Bloomberg said it would stop critically covering the Democratic candidates.But the outlet said it would continue to investigate US President Donald Trump's administration.Mr Trump's campaign called the Bloomberg decision proof of ""bias"". ""Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events,"" said Mr Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, in a statement on Monday. ""We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis."" The president and Mr Bloomberg have traded barbs ever since the former New York mayor began weighing his decision to run. Announcing his candidacy, the billionaire businessman said he was standing in the race to ""defeat Donald Trump"". ""The stakes could not be higher,"" he wrote in a blog. ""We must win this election.""Just prior to Mr Bloomberg's official entry, Mr Trump taunted ""little Michael"", calling him a ""nothing"" and saying he ""doesn't have the magic"" to make it to the White House. The Trump campaign's decision to revoke Bloomberg News' press credential highlights the potential challenges faced by the outlet as its owner runs for president.After the announcement from the Trump campaign the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee said the president's own party would take similar action.""Media outlets should be independent and fair, and this decision proves that Bloomberg News is neither,"" Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote on Twitter, adding that the party stands with Mr Trump and ""will no longer credential Bloomberg representatives"".In response, Bloomberg editor-in chief John Micklethwait, released a statement on Monday saying ""the accusation of bias couldn't be further from the truth.""We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.""Last month's announcement from Mr Micklethwait, a British journalist, that the outlet would not ""investigate"" its owner or any of his Democratic 2020 rivals met a backlash from some former Bloomberg reporters. Megan Murphy, a former editor at Bloomberg, tweeted that it was ""staggering"" for any editor to prevent reporters from covering the election. It is truly staggering that *any* editor would put their name on a memo that bars an army of unbelievably talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time. Staggering.End of Twitter post  by @meganmurpBloomberg News said it would continue to run opinion polls on the presidential race, interview candidates and follow the campaigns. Mr Bloomberg began the news service in 1990 as an extension of the financial information he sold to customers. Bloomberg News includes a TV and radio network in addition to a magazine. This is not the first time that the president has denied credentials to news outlets. During Mr Trump's 2016 White House bid, his campaign revoked credentials for reporters from Huffington Post, Politico, Buzzfeed, and the Washington Post.The former New York mayor is one of 17 Democrats vying for a chance to take on Donald Trump"
Trump halts plan to treat cartels as terrorists,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50697635,"US President Donald Trump has delayed plans to legally designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups.Mr Trump had vowed to label the gangs as terrorists after the killing last month of nine American citizens from a Mormon community in Mexico.But he has put the plans on hold on the request of his Mexican counterpart, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador.""I celebrate that he has taken our opinion into account,"" the Mexican president said.""We thank President Trump for respecting our decisions and for choosing to maintain a policy of good neighbourliness, a policy of cooperation with us,"" he added. Mr Trump's original announcement came after three women and six children of dual US-Mexican nationality were killed in an ambush in a remote area of northern Mexico.Following the attack the victims' community, the LeBarons, petitioned the White House to list the cartels as terror groups, saying: ""They are terrorists and it's time to acknowledge it.""The move would have widened the scope for US legal and financial action against cartels but Mexico saw it as a violation of its sovereignty. The US president has now put the plans on hold.""All necessary work has been completed to declare Mexican Cartels terrorist organizations,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Statutorily we are ready to do so.""But Mr Trump said his Mexican counterpart is ""a man who I like and respect, and has worked so well with us,"" adding that he was temporarily holding off on the designation and stepping up ""joint efforts to deal decisively with these vicious and ever-growing organizations!""He did not comment on how long the delay would last.Mexico's brutal drug war claims tens of thousands of lives every year, as powerful trafficking groups battle for territory and influence. In 2017 more than 30,000 people were killed in the country, with the murder rate having more than tripled since 2006."
Trump impeachment inquiry: A simple guide,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39945744,"US President Donald Trump is facing a process that could eventually see him removed from office.It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020.Things are still at an early stage. The first public hearings started 13 November in the lower house of Congress, the House of Representatives. That is controlled by the Democrats. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing.Depending on what happens in the next few weeks, Mr Trump could end up facing impeachment - but more on what that means below.President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democrat challengers, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president.This would all amount to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine is using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia.A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with Mr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September.A rough transcript of the call revealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden.The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified that the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this.In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly.Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was ""perfect"".He has called the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats and elements of the media. He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate ""corruption"", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked.The Republican defence comes in three parts:- Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure- The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back- US military aid was eventually releasedTo impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial.The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"".It's important to note that is a political process, rather than a criminal one.It happens in two stages. Proceedings have to be started by the House of Representatives.A vote to impeach only needs a simple majority to pass and if it does, the process then moves to the Senate where a trial is held.But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history.The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party.Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well.But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required.The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote.Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal.The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office."
US prison staff suspended over Nazi salute photo,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50686516,"Several US prison employees have been suspended after a photo emerged showing training class participants giving what appears to be a Nazi salute. The image shows employees at the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation making the gesture below a sign that reads ""Hail Byrd!"", referring to a class instructor.State Governor Jim Justice has called for the employees to be fired.Officials have also informed faith and community leaders about the photo.It shows around 30 blurred faces and appears to have been recently shot for the state's ""Basic Training Class #18"". The photo does not include names of the employees and the location is not known.The class reportedly took place from 21 October to 27 November. The text referred to a class leader, the state Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety said. ""I condemn the photo of Basic Training Class #18 in the strongest possible terms,"" Governor Jim Justice told The Washington Post. ""I have directed Secretary Jeff Sandy of the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety to continue actively investigating this incident, and I have ordered the termination of all those that are found to be involved in this conduct.""In a letter to employees at the facility, Mr Sandy said that several people had already been suspended.""It is distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive and completely inappropriate,"" he said. ""It betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.""The department had informed faith leaders and community leaders of the photo, Mr Sandy added. ""We have asked for their help to address it effectively, including with recommended changes or additions to our training programs,"" he wrote."
US House votes for China sanctions over Uighurs,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50653864,"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to counter what it calls the ""arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment"" of Uighur Muslims in China.It calls for ""targeted sanctions"" on members of the Chinese government - and names the Communist Party secretary in the Xinjiang autonomous region, Chen Quanguo.The bill still needs approval from the Senate and from President Donald Trump.China reacted angrily, calling it a ""gross interference"".But Uighur rights groups welcomed the passage of the bill, which they said sent an important message to China.                                                                                                                    The Uighur Human Rights Policy Act 2019 bill was passed by 407 to 1 in the House of Representatives on Tuesday night.Its passage comes days after Mr Trump signed into law a bill that supports pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong - also leading to condemnation from China.The BBC's China correspondent John Sudworth said - if it became law - the bill would mark the most significant international attempt to pressure China over its mass detention of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.The purpose of the bill is ""to address gross violations of universally recognised human rights, including the mass internment of over 1,000,000 Uighurs"". It also accuses China of ""systematically discriminating"" against Uighurs by ""denying them a range of civil and political rights, including the freedoms of expression, religion, movement and a fair trial"". The bill details some of the policies allegedly carried out by China against Muslims in Xinjiang. These include:The Uighur bill calls for sanctions on Chinese officials who are ""credibly alleged to be responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang"". It also names Mr Chen, who has been dubbed the ""architect"" of the camps.The bill calls on Mr Trump to ""condemn abuses"" against the Uighurs, for China to immediately close all the camps, and to ""ensure respect for internationally-guaranteed human rights"". Republican Thomas Massie, from Kentucky, voted against the Uighur bill. He also voted against the Hong Kong bill. On Twitter, Mr Massie explained his rationale for voting against both bills, writing: ""When our government meddles in the internal affairs of foreign countries, it invites those governments to meddle in our affairs.""China, which denies any mistreatment of Uighurs, said the bill was an affront to its policies in Xinjiang and amounted to interference in its internal affairs.""This bill deliberately smears the human rights condition in Xinjiang, slanders China's efforts in de-radicalization and counter-terrorism, and viciously attacks the Chinese government's Xinjiang policy,"" a foreign ministry statement said.It said the policy in Xinjiang was ""about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism"", adding that ""thanks to those efforts, Xinjiang hasn't seen a single terrorist attack over the past three years"".The statement also said ""the international community speaks highly of China's Xinjiang policy"".China also reacted angrily to the Hong Kong bill - suspending visits by US Navy ships and aircraft to Hong Kong, and issuing sanctions against US-based human rights groups.In contrast, the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a human rights group, hailed the bill for rebuffing what it called ""China's continued push of extreme persecution"" in Xinjiang.Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the WUC, said the organisation looked forward to President Trump signing the bill into law.The House overwhelmingly passes historic legislation to condemn gross human rights violations of Uyghurs and other ethnic Turkic Muslims, and calling for an end to arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment of these communities inside and outside China. pic.twitter.com/6gCNYkFvlgEnd of Twitter post  by @uyghurprojectRights groups say hundreds of thousands of Muslims are detained in high-security prison camps across Xinjiang. The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" in order to combat violent religious extremism.But evidence shows many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - for example, praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey.Records seen by the BBC show China is also deliberately separating Muslim children from their families. This is an attempt to ""raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language"", Dr Adrian Zenz, a German researcher, told BBC News earlier this year.""I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide.""China's ambassador to the UK said the allegations were ""lies"".

Canada Conservative leader in surprise resignation,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50762474,"Canada's Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is stepping down after facing criticism for failing to oust Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October's election. He told the House of Commons it was ""one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made"". Mr Scheer said he would stay on in his role until the party chooses a new leader.He only became leader in May 2017 in a razor thin victory against 12 rivals.  Mr Trudeau thanked Mr Scheer for ""his dedication and service"" and said he understood the many sacrifices made by the families of politicians. ""I wish him all the very, very best in his next steps.""Making the announcement on Thursday, Mr Scheer, 40, spoke about the sacrifices made by his family for his political career. The decision to resign was not made lightly, he said. ""But in order to chart the course ahead, this party, this movement needs someone who can give 100 per cent to the efforts. ""And after some conversations with my kids and my wife and loved ones, I felt it was time to put my family first.""He said the strain of an election had taken a toll on five children and wife, Jill, whom he called ""heroic"". Mr Scheer has served in federal politics since 2004 since being elected to the House of Commons at age 25. Mr Scheer's resignation came amid revelations, first reported by Global News, that the Conservative Party had helped cover the cost of private school for the Conservative leader's children.Conservative Party Executive Director Dustin van Vugt said in a statement the party had offered to reimburse some of the costs associated with being party leader and relocating Mr Scheer's family to Canada's capital, ""as is the normal practice for political parties"". ""Shortly after Mr Scheer was elected leader,"" Mr van Vugt said, ""we had a meeting where I made a standard offer to cover costs associated with moving his family from Regina to Ottawa. ""This includes a differential in schooling costs between Regina and Ottawa. All proper procedures were followed and signed off on by the appropriate people.""Mr van Vught's office insisted that Mr Scheer's resignation was not related to the reimbursements. News of the tuition assistance divided Conservatives. Many defended Mr Scheer, while others decried the funding as inappropriate. ""There's nothing proper or appropriate about having party members' money used to pay for someone's children's private school education,"" Conservative strategist Kory Teneycke told the Globe and Mail newspaper. ""There's nothing normal about that.""Analysis by Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Toronto Although the precise timing of Mr Scheer's departure may come as a surprise to many, few could say that they expected him to hold on to power for much longer.Mr Scheer has been struggling to rally the party behind him since the October election. Although he vowed to stay on and fight, the voices clamouring for his removal had been growing louder. Several party members had mounted a public campaign for his ousting, while a veteran MP who had served under Stephen Harper declined a position in Mr Scheer's shadow cabinet.News that the party had been partly paying for his children's private school did not go over well with the base, who favour small-government and fiscal frugality.  It proved to be the final nail in the coffin. In October's election, Mr Scheer led his Conservatives to a 22-seat bump in the House of Commons and edged out the Liberals in the popular vote. Just days before the election, some polls projected the Conservatives would win the most seats.But the leader remained dogged by questions about his position on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage, which are popular in Canada.Critics of Mr Scheer say he failed to capitalise on the prime minister's stumbles while in office and on the trail, namely the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and pictures that emerged of Mr Trudeau in blackface. Still, the party picked up seats in New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia and swept the prairies, leaving Mr Trudeau without any party members from Canada's oil-producing provinces Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Mr Scheer will remain on as a member of Parliament. He said the Conservative Party will now begin steps towards electing a new leader. Many had expected Mr Scheer to hang on as leader at least until Conservatives gather in Toronto for their biennial convention next April. On Thursday, Mr Scheer called for party unity and vowed the next leader would have his full support. ""The party that we've all built together is far too important for one individual. ""Our party is not a cult of personality, it's not shaped by whoever's name is on the masthead but by the hundreds of thousands of Conservatives who pound in lawn signs, sit on their riding associations and donate a few dollars every month."""
White House dismisses impeachment hearings,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50694769,"The White House has indicated it will not take part in further impeachment hearings in Congress due next week. In a letter sent to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, it urges Democrats to ""end this inquiry now"". The letter does not explicitly rule out attending but officials told US media that the administration saw no reason to take part in an ""unfair"" process.  President Donald Trump is alleged to have pressured Ukraine in a way that would help him politically. A deadline for the administration to decide whether to send a legal representative or witnesses to the House Judiciary Committee passed on Friday. The committee is in the process of drawing up articles of impeachment against Mr Trump, leading to a vote in the House of Representatives before a trial in the Senate - possibly early in January. The letter, from White House counsel Pat Cipollone to judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler, describes the impeachment process as a ""charade"". House Democrats are proceeding with articles of impeachment without a ""single shred of evidence"", it says.""Your impeachment inquiry is completely baseless and has violated basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness.""You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings,"" it goes on. The letter finishes by reminding the committee that President Trump has called - if the impeachment process continues - for a ""fair trial in the Senate"" to happen soon. Mr Trump's Republicans are in the majority in the Senate; the Democrats hold sway in the House of Representatives and on the judiciary committee.""We haven't been given any fair opportunity to participate. The speaker has already announced the predetermined result and they will not give us the ability to call any witnesses,"" an official told Reuters.An anonymous whistleblower complained to Congress in September about a July phone call by Mr Trump to the president of Ukraine, in which Mr Trump appeared to tie US military assistance to Ukraine launching investigations which could help him politically.In return for those investigations, Democrats say Mr Trump offered two bargaining chips - $400m (¬£304m) of military aid that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats say this pressure on a vulnerable US ally constitutes an abuse of power.The first investigation Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine was into former Vice-President Joe Biden, his main Democratic challenger, and his son Hunter. Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company when his father was President Obama's deputy.The second Trump demand was that Ukraine should try to corroborate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the last US presidential election. This theory has been widely debunked, and US intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016.Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office.If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial.A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber.Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted.President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached."
