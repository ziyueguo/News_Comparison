Trump may add controversial attorney to legal team,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-adding-controversial-lawyer-alan-dershowitz-impeachment/story?id=67674015,"
Gearing up for an impeachment trial in the Senate, President Donald Trump and his top advisers are considering expanding his legal team and bringing on controversial attorney and professor Alan Dershowitz, multiple sources told ABC News.

Dershowitz attended an event Wednesday at the White House and was asked to speak briefly by the president ahead of signing an executive order on anti-Semitism.
""I have advocated that there needs to be one other attorney that's added to the mix for the president, and that is Alan Dershowitz,"" Congressman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a Trump confidant, told the House Freedom Caucus podcast on Wednesday. ""I think he'd be great to come in, get Alan Dershowitz in to be part of that defense team.""

Dershowitz, who was often called upon by the White House and the president's attorneys to appear on television during the Mueller investigation, has been in the headlines due to his ties to now-deceased accused child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Dershowitz was a member of a star legal team that represented Epstein during his multiple investigations beginning in the mid 2000s.
Virginia Roberts Giuffre has alleged in courts documents that she was lent out to Dershowitz for sex by Epstein. Dershowitz has vehemently denied those accusations.

As the White House sets its sights on an impeachment trial, questions have mounted about who would lead the president's defense.
One of the president's personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, is a focus of the impeachment probe and work he did as it relates to Ukraine. Separately, Giuliani's relationship with two Ukraine-born men -- Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted this fall by federal prosecutors -- is the subject of a criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York, according to sources familiar with the matter.
In an op-ed published earlier this week, Dershowitz wrote that the two articles of impeachment proposed by the House Judiciary committee failed to meet the standard in his opinion. ""Both are so vague and open ended that they could be applied in partisan fashion by a majority of the House against almost any president from the opposing party.""

Dershowitz, a longtime professor at Harvard University, most notably won the appeal of Claus von Bülow's 1982 conviction for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny. He was also part of the legal ""Dream Team"" for O.J. Simpson's murder trial.

Trump 'clear and present danger': Judiciary Dems,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judiciary-committee-trump-impeachment-hearing-live-updates/story?id=67581755,"
The House Judiciary Committee on Monday heard  closing arguments for and against President Donald Trump's impeachment, setting off a busy two weeks on Capitol Hill expected to end with a House floor vote on the charges ahead of Christmas.

As they prepare to release articles of impeachment against Trump as early as this week, Democratic lawmakers called attorneys from the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees to present evidence from the Democrats' Ukraine investigation and to argue   that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically.
Republican lawyers from the same House panels argued against Democrats' impeachment efforts and defended the president's actions toward Ukraine at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

Here is how the hearing unfolded.

Chairman Jerry Nadler adjourns the hearing close to ten hours after it began.

In his closing statement, Nadler says, ""We know that President Trump has put himself before his country.""

Republicans offered ""not one substantive word in the president's defense,"" he continues.

""The fact are clear. The danger to our democracy is clear and our duty is clear,"" he says.

""President Trump violated his oath to the American people and placed his own private interests ahead of our national security, and constitutes a threat to our election and government.

""Such conduct is impeachable,"" he says as he closes. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler adjourns hearing close to 10 hours after it began:  ""We know that Pres. Trump has put himself before his country,"" Nadler said in his closing statement https://t.co/37xFo8BakV pic.twitter.com/xzPymS1PYZ— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

Ranking Member Doug Collins, in his closing statement, says, ""At the end of the day, the case isn't made.""

""This is the first impeachment that is partisan on facts that are not agreed to,"" he says, referring to as an ""impeachment scam"" one last time.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and strong ally of the president, said Democrats were pursuing impeachment and ignoring the needs of the American people.

""The last public opinion poll showed Congress had an approval rating at about nine percent. By contrast Muammar Gaddafi had an approval rating at 13 percent, and his own people dragged him into the streets and killed him,"" Gaetz said, of the Libyan dictator.
""This impeachment process demonstrates the worst in us and it is depriving us the opportunity to raise our gaze and meet the needs of the American people,"" he said.

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., followed Gaetz's remarks by defending the impeachment efforts and House Democrats' legislative record this year.

""We were also elected to hold this president accountable,"" he said. ""That’s what we’re engaged in today.""

In his line of questioning, Ranking Member Rep. Doug Collins repeatedly asked Goldman, the Democrats' investigator, to explain why Democrats sought phone records between members of Congress and journalists as part of the investigation.

The report released by the House Intelligence Committee showed multiple calls between the top Republican on that committee Rep. Devin Nunes and Rudy Giuliani.
Goldman declined to give details on how Democrats conducted the investigation.

""I am going to go on record and tell you I'm not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,"" Goldman said.

Collins implied Goldman doesn't want to answer because it would incriminate himself or Schiff and that Schiff should have been the one to testify.

""You're here without a pin because your chairman will not testify. That says all we need to hear. He doesn't stand behind his report so he sends you,"" Collins said, referencing the pins worn by members of Congress.

Collins also referenced a part of Goldman's testimony earlier in the day when he referenced Sondland's donation to the president's inauguration, which Sondland testified was to help secure a ticket to the event. Collins noted that Goldman has donated money to Democrats.

When Goldman asked Collins what he was implying about his personal role, Rep. Matt Gaetz interjected to say ""the point is, we want Mr. Schiff in that chair, not you.""

Goldman asked to be given time to respond but Nadler did not interject and Collins handed over questioning to Republican Counsel Ashley Hurt Callen.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders and Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room note more fireworks during the first round of questioning.

Democratic Counsel Barry Berke has been aggressively questioning Republican Counsel Steve Castor and this time the interruption came from GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner.

Berke was questioning Castor about Jennifer Williams, the aide to Vice President Mike Pence, calling President Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's President Zelensky ""unusual.""

He accused Castor and Republicans of inaccurately representing Williams’ description of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call, as part of a larger batch of questions casting aspersions on the GOP report.

“Do you have an explanation, sir, where you said Ms. Williams said that the call was unusual when, in fact, she said it was unusual and inappropriate and of a political nature?” Berke asked.

“We described what Ms. Williams said,” Castor replied.

“No you didn’t,” Berke shot back.

After a number of contentious exchanges with Castor, Berke has periodically returned to Goldman to underscore his points.

“Is it important to be fair to the American people to accurately report what they said?” Berke asked him before questioning Castor about Williams.

“Of course,” he replied.

Nadler then shot back and said that sharp cross examination of a witness is not badgering.""The lawyer is badgering the witness,"" Rep. Sensenbrenner objects during one of multiple GOP interruptions of impeachment hearing. ""We have to have some decorum in here.""""Sharp cross-examination of a witness is not badgering the witness,"" Nadler says. https://t.co/nPeZz2wMi8 pic.twitter.com/uCPeXJ3dOj— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

In another testy back-and-forth, Castor suggested Trump wasn't asking for a Biden investigation.

""Was the president requesting an investigation into Joe Biden?"" Berke asked.

""I don't think the president was asking for an investigation into Joe Biden. It was just a comment,"" Castor said dismissively.

Then, questioning Goldman, Berke pointed out that Trump was prepared to discuss corruption on the call via White House talking points, but did not mention it once.

""Did he mention looking into anything other than the two investigations that were politically helpful to him, the 2016 election investigation and the investigation of his political rival, former vice President Joe Biden?"" Berke asked.

""No, he did not,"" Goldman said.

Castor also argues that Democrats don't have a case for obstruction of justice charges against the president because the administration has released transcripts of the July 25 call and the earlier call between Trump and Zelenskiy and allowed U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland to testify.

Even so, the White House has refused to cooperate with the inquiry in other ways by declining to provide documents and blocking other administration officials from testifying.
""The report presents a story as if the evidence is clear when, in reality, it's anything but,"" Castor says as he wraps up his statement.

After Castor's presentation, the committee has started the extended round of questions. Nadler and Collins, along with their counsels, will have up to 45 minutes each to question the witnesses.

Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, tried to object to the fact that Berke, who presented on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, is now seated at Nadler's side for this round pf questioning.

""I know that you don’t get to be a witness and judge in the same case,"" Gohmert, a former judge who has accused Democrats of orchestrating a ""coup,"" shouted at Nadler.

""That's not a point of order,"" Nadler replied.

As the hearing resumes, Steve Castor is now making his second opening statement in his role representing Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.

He's summarizing the report they produced that found no evidence the president committed an impeachable offense.

""The inquiry has returned no direct evidence that President Trump withheld a meeting or security assistance in order to pressure President Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Biden. 
Witnesses who testified in the inquiry have denied having awareness of criminal activity or even an impeachable offense,"" Castor says.
The committee is in a short recess.

Even after Nadler has denied Republican requests to hold a hearing with their own witnesses, including, they're not letting go of that talking point.

During the break a new sign appeared on the Republican side of the dais with Schiff's face on a milk carton. It reads ""Missing"" and says ""if found contact Jerry Nadler."" according to Faulders and ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room.And....a new sign. pic.twitter.com/fBazuUdPsh— Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) December 9, 2019

The committee is now hearing summations of the evidence from both sides, starting with the Director of Investigations for the House Intelligence Committee, Daniel Goldman.

He'll be followed by the Republican presentation.
""We are here today because Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, abused the power of his office—the American presidency—for his personal political benefit."" Goldman says.

""President Trump directed a months-long scheme to solicit foreign help in his 2020 reelection campaign, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political interference in our domestic affairs,"" he begins. ""As part of the scheme, President Trump applied increasing pressure on the president of Ukraine to publicly announce two investigations helpful to his personal reelection efforts.
""He applied this pressure himself and through his agents within and outside of the U.S. government by conditioning a desperately-sought Oval Office meeting and $391 million in taxpayer-funded, congressionally-appropriated military assistance—vital to Ukraine’s ability to fend off Russian aggression—on the announcement of political investigations helpful to his personal interests.""

Republican Counsel Steve Castor presents the counterargument to Berke's conclusions, saying he would provide context to support that the evidence does not support Democrats' allegations.

""Overall, at best, the impeachment inquiry record is riddled with hearsay, presumptions, and speculation. There are conflicting and ambiguous facts throughout the record—facts that could be interpreted in different ways,"" Castor says in his opening statement.
""The record in the Democrats impeachment inquiry does not show that President Trump abused the power of his office or obstructed Congress. To impeach a president who 63 million people voted for -- over eight lines in a call transcript -- is baloney,"" he says.

He argues that Democrats' haven't proven Trump acted with malicious intent in his dealings with Ukraine and cited comments from President Zelenskiy that he did not feel pressured on the July 25 call.Minority counsel Steve Castor: ""The purpose of this hearing, as we understand it, is to discuss whether President Donald J. Trump’s conduct fits the definition of a high crime and misdemeanor. It does not."" https://t.co/nPeZz2wMi8 pic.twitter.com/N24oG3akEZ— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

Castor also cites testimony from legal experts last week, specifically from George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, who raised concerns Democrats are pushing for impeachment too quickly to fully build a case and pursue more information.

""The artificial and arbitrary political deadline by which Democrats are determined to finish impeachment by Christmas leads to a rushed process. And missed opportunities to obtain relevant information,"" Castor said.
Barry Berke, the majority counsel for the Judiciary Committee, argues the evidence collected in the impeachment inquiry so far shows President Trump's behavior fits the description of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and constitutes an impeachable offense.
Berke specifically says the president abused his power, betrayed the national interest, and took actions that would compromise American elections.

""The scheme by President Trump so brazen, so clear, supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted, contemporaneous records, that it's hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses. This is a big deal. President Trump did what a president of our nation is not allowed to do,"" he says. ""The evidence is overwhelming that the president abused his power,"" majority counsel Barry Berke says.""In abusing that power, the president betrayed the national interest...It is clear that the president risked corrupting our elections."" https://t.co/nPeZz2wMi8 pic.twitter.com/K3s5kUN2TL— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

ABC News' Katherine Faulders in the hearing room reports: The overwhelming theme from Democratic Counsel Berke was this: President Trump thought he got away with the Ukraine scheme. He used his powers to interfere with the investigation, but then he got caught. And his abuse of power is an impeachable offense.

Berke played multiple clips of the president, including one where Trump said: ""Then I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president,"" referring to the Constitution.

Berke said that the president's ""excuse"" is that the military aid to Ukraine was ultimately released but Berke argue the aid was released only ""after President Trump got caught doing the scheme.""

""He put his political re-election interests over the nation's national security and the integrity of its election. He did it intentionally. He did it corruptly. He abused his powers in ways that the founders feared most. No person in this country has the ability to prevent investigations and neither does the president,"" Berke says.

Ranking Member Rep. Doug Collins continues to attack Democrats' for pursuing a predetermined outcome in the impeachment inquiry, saying they have already decided to vote to impeach President Trump.

""For anyone to think that this was not a baked deal is not being honest with themselves,"" he says in his opening statement.

Collins also criticizes Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, saying he should have to testify directly on the motivations and process behind his committee's report instead of sending staff.

Collins said he's seriously concerned about the political motivations behind the impeachment proceedings and repeated criticism from President Trump that Schiff dramatized a reading of the transcript of the July 25 call at the heart of the inquiry.

""I love this institution, but in the last three days -- over the last three or four days I have seen stuff that just bother me to no end and should bother everyone,"" Collins said, citing Speak Nancy Pelosi's direction to draft impeachment articles after last week's hearing.

""At the end of the day, all this is about is about a clock and a calendar. Because they can't get over the fact Donald Trump is president of the United States and they don't have a candidate that they think can beat him. It's all political. And as we have talked about before, this is a show,"" he adds.Rep.

As he gets back to his opening statement, Nadler cites testimony from constitutional experts from last week's hearing, setting up the Democrats' argument that President Trump's behavior exactly fulfills the type of abuse of power the framers had in mind when the laid out the process for impeachment.

""As we heard in our last hearing, the framers of the Constitution were careful students of history and clear in their vision for the new nation. They knew that threats to democracy can take many forms, that we must protect against them,"" Nadler says.

""The debates around the framing make clear that the most serious such offenses include abuse of power, betrayal of the nation through foreign entanglements and corruption of public office,"" he continues.

""Any one of these violations of the public trust would compel the members of this committee to take action. When combined, in a single course of action, they state the strongest possible case for impeachment and removal from office,"" he says.

The New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, gavels the hearing into session at 9:08 a.m.

Republicans raise an objection within seconds of Nadler beginning his opening statement, setting the stage for more objections to come.

A protester starts shouting from the back of the room, interrupting Nadler: ""Jerry Nadler, you're the one committing treason"" and ""We voted for Donald Trump."" Capitol Police quickly remove him.

The hearing is set to begin at 9 a.m. but relatively few committee members are in the room.

Republicans have set up a large sign with the words ""Where's Adam?"" in white letters against a black background, signaling their displeasure that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will not be testifying as they wanted. They have repeatedly accused him of lying about whether he knew and coordinated with the intelligence community whistleblower who triggered the impeachment probe.

ABC's Mary Bruce reports this might the last chance Democrats have to persuade the American public on such a nationally-televised scale before a vote on articles of impeachment.

ABC's Benjamin Siegel and Allison Pecorin report a Democratic official told reporters over the weekend that Democrats intend to use this hearing to make their ""theory of the case"" against President Donald Trump and his abuse of power.

Democrats, according to the official, plan to argue today that Trump's use of his office for personal political gain ahead of the election represents the ""framers' nightmare,"" by acting in a way that ""betrays our national security and corrupts our elections using a foreign power.""

They will argue that Trump's actions were part of a ""repeated pattern,"" and that the Ukraine episode is important because it represents a ""future pattern,"" highlighting the urgency of moving quickly to impeach the president ahead of the 2020 election.

As members start to take their seats in the hearing room, ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is facing a difficult challenge making the final call on how broad articles of impeachment will be.

She says Pelosi has to be especially mindful of the views of Democrats in swing districts.

GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, tells ABC News' Tom Llamas that there is no evidence of any impeachable conduct, that Democrats can't point to any ""crimes committed.""

""This whole thing has been a farce,"" she says.

Democratic members and aides spent the weekend in Washington preparing for the upcoming hearings. Judiciary Committee Democratic staff also released a report highlighting the historical and legal arguments behind their impeachment efforts against Trump.
On Saturday, they huddled with Harvard Law School professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, who's been advising the caucus throughout the impeachment process. They also prepared for the upcoming hearing in the stately Longworth Office Building hearing room, which has hosted weeks of public impeachment proceedings.

Working with committee and leadership staff behind closed doors, they prepared their questions for Monday's hearing, with former Hill staffers playing the roles of committee Republicans, according to sources familiar with the preparations.

They also discussed the potential charges against Trump, which they're expected to introduce and approve in the Judiciary Committee later this week.
""We need to make it clear within those articles that there is a pattern of conduct here, that Ukraine was the most egregious example of the president abusing his office while he was president of the United States, shaking down a foreign nation to interfere in our elections,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said Sunday. ""We need to be focused, we need to be clear, we need to present the best possible case if we are moving in this direction.""
In an interview with CNN Sunday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., did not commit to including evidence of obstruction of justice from special counsel Robert Mueller's report in the forthcoming articles.

""We have a very rock-solid case,"" Nadler said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""I think the case we have, if presented to a jury, would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat.""
House Republicans are expected to argue that the Democrats' case falls short, that they lack sufficient firsthand evidence to conclusively charge Trump with abusing his power and undermining U.S. national security in his dealings with Ukraine.

In requests for additional witnesses and information, they have outlined a potential GOP strategy for a Senate impeachment trial that could focus on former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine, as well as the intelligence community whistleblower behind the complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry.

FBI director reacts to report on Russia investigation: Exclusive,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-chris-wray-reacts-doj-watchdog-report/story?id=67605418,"
FBI Director Christopher Wray offered mixed reactions to a Justice Department watchdog report that uncovered ""serious performance failures"" on the part of agents involved in the Russia investigation but ultimately determined the bureau was justified in launching its probe.

In an exclusive broadcast interview with ABC News, Wray lamented ""actions described in this report that [he] considered unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution."" But, he said it was ""important that the inspector general found that, in this particular instance, the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization.""
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Monday released his 478-page report chronicling the circumstances surrounding the FBI's surveillance of members of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, including Carter Page, who had lived and worked in Russia. In his report, Horowitz asserted that the FBI decision to surveil Page was legal.
“We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek [surveillance] on Carter Page,” Horowitz wrote.

But the president and his allies have called it ""a major SPY scandal"" and accused those involved of working on behalf of the ""Deep State."" Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018 Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!
Wray did not respond directly to the president, but pushed back on the ""Deep State"" characterization of the bureau's work.

""I think that's the kind of label that's a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage,"" Wray said. ""So that's not a term I would ever use to describe our work force and I think it's an affront to them.""
Horowitz's report described a series of major errors and omissions related to the surveillance application targeting a former Trump campaign aide that ""made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.""

""In my view, every error and omission is significant and it's something we need to take seriously,"" Wray told ABC News.
The president and his allies have long alleged that the Trump campaign was illegally spied on, aggressively accusing both the Obama administration and the FBI of carrying out what Trump has called ""one of the biggest political scandals in history.""

Asked whether he thought the FBI unfairly targeted the Trump campaign, Wray offered a blunt assessment: ""I do not.""
Attorney General William Barr made headlines in April 2019 when he told a Senate panel that ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign, adding there was a need to ""explore"" whether the probe was ""adequately predicated."" Wray has previously said ""spying"" is ""not a term I would use,"" and on Monday reiterated that point.
""Again, different people have different colloquial terms,"" he said, "" but we use terms like ‘investigation' and ‘surveillance.'""

Wray also pushed back on a widely debunked theory put forth by the president and his allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election – and sounded the alarm on the Kremlin’s plans for the 2020 cycle.

“We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,” Wray said, adding that “as far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.”

Wray took over the FBI's top spot in August 2017, months after James Comey's dismissal from the position. After releasing his report Monday, Horowitz is expected to face lawmakers on Wednesday in a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump enters a historic next phase on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the constitutional grounds for drafting articles of impeachment.

House Democrats have called three legal experts to testify before the committee: Professors Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, and Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law.

Testifying for Republicans will be Jonathan Turley of The George Washington University Law School.

Heavily redacted communications on withholding of Ukraine aid released,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heavily-redacted-communications-withholding-ukraine-aid-released-trump/story?id=67669236,"
The Trump administration released heavily redacted documents Thursday evening that, without the redactions, would have been the first communications revealed between government agencies regarding aid money to Ukraine being held up.

The Freedom of Information Act request, filed by the Center for Public Integrity, a D.C.-based nonprofit group that specializes in investigative reporting, was first granted by a federal judge last month. That order required the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to release documents to that group from April of this year regarding the Ukraine aid.

The nearly $400 million military assistance to Ukraine, which was held up just days before the infamous July 25 call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been at the center of the House impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, as House investigators zeroed in on whether the president withheld the aid in an effort to pressure Zelenskiy's new administration into investigating Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son.
""We are deeply disappointed that the public won’t have access to this important information at the heart of the impeachment process,"" said Susan Smith Richardson, CEO of the Center for Public Integrity. ""But we will continue to fight to ensure that the documents see the light of day.""

In the documents released Thursday, there are conversations over email between Elaine McCusker, the deputy comptroller at the Department of Defense, and Michael Duffey from OMB regarding the Ukraine aid, but the conversations are mostly redacted. The aides did send each other press reports from August when the Ukraine aid being held up was first discovered. Duffey was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee for testimony during its impeachment inquiries, but he followed most White House officials and did not comply with that request.
The documents also include spreadsheets of financial figures that appear to be related to Ukraine based on notes.

It was first revealed during a July 18 meeting between the OMB and other officials that the White House had decided to withhold the Ukraine aid. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the move was at the direction of the president.
National Security Council's Ukraine expert, Alex Vindman, and Vice President Mike Pence's national security aide, Jennifer Williams, testified before Congress that they first learned of the hold-up as early as July 3.

The possibility of a hold up when it was announced on July 18 immediately sparked confusion and concerns from national security officials and diplomats, prompting a series of NSC-led inter-agency meetings, during which officials came to a unanimous conclusion that the security assistance should be resumed, according to several witnesses' testimony in the House impeachment inquiry.
Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told House investigators that aides at the Pentagon were confused by the hold on the financial aid because the Defense Department had certified the financial transfer in May when Ukraine had met the necessary anti-corruption benchmarks. She said senior aides were unclear how everything would ""play out"" legally.

""So the comments in the room at the deputies' level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out,"" she told Congress, according to the transcript of her interview behind closed doors before the public hearings. ""And at that meeting, the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.""

In September, shortly after House committees launched a wide-ranging investigation into whistleblower allegations that Trump, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others attempted to pressure Zelenskiy's government to dig into the president's political rival, the Ukraine aid was suddenly released.
The president and his allies have repeatedly refuted the idea of a quid pro quo, but Mulvaney in October admitted there was one, telling ABC News’ Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl during a White House briefing that Trump had ordered him to hold up the military aid in part to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation of Democrats.

Much of the president's closest allies' accounts of how the Ukraine assistance was held up and eventually released are still shrouded in mystery as the White House, the State Department and the Defense Department have directed their top officials to not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. Even for those who went around their agencies' direction and complied with House subpoenas, the administration has blocked them from getting access to their official records to help their testimony.
House Democrats in their articles of impeachment revealed on Tuesday included President Trump's order to direct the White House and other executive branch agencies to defy congressional subpoenas as part of the arguments in support of the president's obstruction of Congress.

But more of those documents are expected to see light as part of media outlets and watchdog groups' open records requests.

The Center for Public Integrity is expected to receive more records from the Defense Department and OMB by Dec. 20 as part of its records request, and the Washington-based watchdog group American Oversight is also expected to receive some records related to Ukraine assistance from the Defense Department and the OMB."
House passes key defense legislation establishing Space Force and paid parental leave,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-strikes-deal-white-house-passing-key-defense/story?id=67663735,"
The House passed a key defense bill on Wednesday that includes the establishment of the Space Force, 12 weeks of paid parental leave for civil servant and reforms for privatized military housing.

The agreement on the contents of the bill have been hailed as a moment of bipartisanship amid the contentious impeachment debate currently embroiling Capitol Hill.
The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 passed in a 377-48 vote in the House, setting it up for a vote in the Senate before the bill moves to the president's desk for signature. However, a separate spending bill will be required to fund the policy items listed in the NDAA.Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force! Congress – don’t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2019 Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force! Congress – don’t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!
President Donald Trump touted the bill as a success on Wednesday ahead of the House vote, tweeting that he would sign it ""immediately.""
Here are some of the items included in this year's NDAA:

The NDAA will establish the U.S. Space Force as the sixth armed service, joining the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. It will be housed under the Air Force in a similar manner as to how the Marine Corps is a part of the Navy.
A congressional logjam on the bill was removed late last week after Democrats secured an agreement for paid leave in return for support for the creation of Space Force, a key initiative of the Trump administration.

The defense bill will provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all federal civilian employees in the event of birth or adoption of a child.
“Including paid family leave is a victory for all workers because it will help push more employers in the right direction and ensure more workers get paid family leave,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., in a statement on Monday. ""Expanding access to paid family leave helps the health and economic well-being of individuals who have it and strengthens the ability of employers to retain their workers.”
The NDAA implements reforms to privatized military housing, the most substantial overhaul to the system since it was created in 1996.

""These reforms address the considerable gaps in oversight and accountability seen at all levels of housing management from ineffective housing offices, to substandard property management, to under-engaged military leadership,"" a summary of the NDAA conference agreement said.
The state of privatized military housing was thrust into the spotlight following news reports that revealed issues with mold, lead paint and vermin at military installations across the country.

The NDAA also requires that the services establish a Tenant Bill of Rights.

The NDAA increased security assistance funding to Ukraine to $300 million to include lethal defense weapons.
The $250 million in aid authorized last year became the center of the impeachment proceedings against the president after it was revealed that the White House had blocked the flow of aid in order to pressure the Ukrainian government into opening a probe into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.

The NDAA includes $5.3 billion in emergency disaster recovery funding to help military installations affected by extreme weather and natural disasters, the re-authorization of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program and a prohibition on the use of firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) after October 2024.

It also has legislation named after Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died after being held in North Korean custody, that expands mandatory sanctions on foreign banks and companies facilitating illicit transactions with Pyongyang. Warmbier's family had actively lobbied for the legislation.
The NDAA did not include an amendment that would have ended the Trump administration's ban on transgender service members. The amendment, which was approved by the House in a 242 to 187 vote, also would have codified non-discrimination in the armed forces.

The bill also excludes two key foreign policy provisions that the House had passed to push back against the president's fierce defense of Saudi Arabia.

Trump has repeatedly insisted on U.S. support for the Saudi and United Arab Emirates coalition's fight against Houthi rebels in Yemen -- vetoing both a series of resolutions to block arms sales to the two countries and a historic War Powers resolution to withdraw U.S. military support for the coalition.
In the face of those vetoes, the House passed a measure to block futures arms sales to the coalition. But during negotiations on the final text, it was stripped from the NDAA, prompting some progressive lawmakers to call for the bill to be vetoed, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.

The final legislation also waters down a measure passed overwhelmingly by the House in a 405 to 7 vote to require the Director of National Intelligence to issue a report on which Saudi officials are responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and issue sanctions.

The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that likely includes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS -- something the Trump administration has so far denied.
Instead, the bill will only require the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to issue a report, leaving it in the administration's hands to take action afterwards. This is something they have refused to do thus far, beyond adopting the Saudi narrative of a rogue operation and punishing nearly all the same officials that the Saudis have.

""Congress clearly bent to the will of the White House in dropping NDAA provisions that would have sanctioned Khashoggi's murderers and limited support to Saudi Arabia's air war in Yemen,"" said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president of Human Rights First. ""After talking a strong game, Congress essentially allowed MBS a free pass. The reason, it seems, is that Congressional Republicans ultimately don’t want to run afoul of Trump, and Trump supports MBS categorically.""

Trump campaign to launch religious-voter outreach coalitions in early 2020,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-launch-religious-voter-outreach-coalitions-early/story?id=67694915,"
President Donald Trump's reelection campaign is planning a massive effort to court religious voters.

The president's team said that in the first quarter of 2020 it will launch three coalitions -- ""Evangelicals for Trump,"" ""Catholics for Trump"" and ""Jewish Voices for Trump"" -- focused on expanding support for Trump within these communities.
The campaign hopes the coalitions will be swayed by the president's record of conservative judicial appointments, including two Supreme Court justices, and his pro-life record.

""The President draws tremendous support from all corners of the religious community and it's important to engage with them,"" Trump campaign director of coalitions Hannah Castillo told ABC News in a statement.

Christians and Catholics, especially among white voters, supported the president in big numbers in 2016, and the campaign hopes these new coalitions help repeat those results. About 8 in 10 self-identified white evangelical Christians said they voted for Trump in 2016, according to Pew Research Center.

But while white Catholics supported Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by a 23-point margin, Hispanic Catholics backed Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin, 67% to 26%, according to Pew.
Trump often touts his record of pushing religious freedom at his campaign rallies, which routinely are kicked off with a prayer by a local pastor.

Trump's personal pastor, Paula White, a controversial figure within the evangelical Christian community, joined the White House in an official capacity in October.

At the United Nations in September, Trump said ""protecting religious freedom is one of my highest priorities."" However, advocates for persecuted religious minorities seeking refuge in the United States have criticized the president's policy of cutting refugee admissions to historically low levels, potentially harming Christians in Iran, Syria, Pakistan and Central and South America.

Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aimed at combating anti-Semitism on college campuses, while the president himself has been criticized for using anti-Semitic language.

Throughout next year, the Trump campaign plans to unveil other coalitions leading up to election day. The campaign earlier this year rolled out voter outreach teams including ""Latinos for Trump,"" ""Women for Trump"" and, most recently, ""Black Voices for Trump,"" which Trump helped launch last month.

The campaign said it counts among supporters more than 30,000 ""Women for Trump,"" 9,000 ""Latinos for Trump"" and 2,000 ""Black Voices for Trump,"" plus about 800 ""Workers for Trump."""
"Biden, sparked by criticism of family, Ukraine, calls man in Iowa a 'damn liar'",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-sparked-criticism-family-ukraine-calls-man/story?id=67524022,"
In a strikingly tense moment on the campaign trail, Joe Biden confronted a man at a town hall in New Hampton, Iowa, calling him ""a damn liar"" after he pressed the former vice president on his son's business ties to Ukraine.

""We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine over there, saying that they want to investigate you. He has no backbone, we know that. But you, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing in order to get access for the president. So you're selling access to the president just like he was,"" the man told Biden, after saying Biden was too old to be president.

""You're a damn liar, man. That's not true. No one has ever said that,"" a heated Biden responded. ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong, and I did not on any occasion, and nobody has ever said it.""

Biden also challenged the man to do push-ups and take an IQ test with him to prove his physical and mental fitness to be president.WATCH: A tense exchange with a voter at  ⁦@JoeBiden⁩’s event in New Hampton, IA this morning, where a voter started out by telling Biden he had two problems with him: he was too old, and his son’s work in Ukraine pic.twitter.com/ok7m0ShFPd— Molly Nagle (@MollyNagle3) December 5, 2019WATCH: A tense exchange with a voter at  ⁦@JoeBiden⁩’s event in New Hampton, IA this morning, where a voter started out by telling Biden he had two problems with him: he was too old, and his son’s work in Ukraine pic.twitter.com/ok7m0ShFPd
After the man, who refused to give his name to ABC News, said he is not voting for Biden, the presidential contender and front-runner said, ""Of course you're not. You're too old to vote for me.""

The man, who identified himself as an 83-year old retired Iowa farmer, told reporters in a press gaggle after the event that he was ""in favor of any other Democratic candidate who’s running,"" adding that Biden is ""the last one on my list.""

""I’d still vote for a Democrat if he’s the nominee. I would not vote for a Republican,"" he said.
At the heart of the man's allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, is that the younger Biden accepted a lucrative seat on the board of directors for Burisma, the Ukrainian company in 2014, during the elder Biden's tenure as vice president.

While the Bidens have not been accused of doing anything illegal, ethics experts say Hunter Biden’s foreign business activity presents ethical concerns.

Trump and his allies have sought to advance a theory that Biden used his position to shield his son and Burisma from investigation by pushing Ukraine's government to fire its then-prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. But Shokin was widely considered ineffective in dealing with corruption both within Ukraine and internationally, and no evidence has emerged to support that theory. No  evidence has surfaced, either, that Biden ""sent his son"" or otherwise used his influence to get his son a seat on the company's board.

Speaking with reporters after the event wrapped, Biden dismissed questions about whether he had lost his temper.

""I didn’t lose my temper, what I wanted to do was shut this down,"" he said. ""You saw the reaction of all the people here...what I wanted to make clear to him was: if he gets more out of control, this is not appropriate behavior at all. That was the message.""

This is not the first time Biden, who has previously launched unsuccessful bids for nation's highest office in 1988 and 2008, engaged in a tense exchange with an attendee at a campaign event.
During Biden's first run for president in 1987, a New Hampshire voter, Frank Fahey, found himself on the receiving end of a tirade from the former Delaware senator after he asked what he thought was an innocent question about Biden's law school experience.

Biden took the question as an insult and partially responded, ""I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship.""

Last month, Fahey, who is now supporting Biden for president and called him the best candidate for the job, reminded Biden of the exchange in early November in New London, and asked Biden what he would have done differently in his handling of the Anita Hill hearings during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearing.

""You ask all the easy questions...Frankie, baby, it’s no wonder I love you,"" Biden joked initially before saying he did all he could to help Hill under the rules of the committee at the time, but admitted that she was treated unfairly.

The Note: Democrats face conflicting internal instincts on impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-democrats-face-conflicting-internal-instincts-impeachment/story?id=67578326,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

It's fast vs. slow, broad vs. narrow, and principles vs. mathematical realities.

Those tensions and more will play out in dramatic and historic fashion this week for Democrats. The action starts with Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing on the Intelligence Committee's findings and extends through the drafting of actual articles of impeachment.

Yes, Democrats have the votes to impeach. And yes, they believe they've accumulated enough evidence to make that happen before Christmas.

But key decisions about how many articles to draft, what they should cover and even whether all of them need to pass are still lingering. Knowing that other potential evidence awaits -- up to and including Rudy Giuliani's strangely timed trip to Ukraine and what President Donald Trump knows about it -- isn't helping Democrats reach a consensus.
Missing from the calculations at this point are how or whether to entice Republicans to support impeachment. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said their choice is whether to be ""patriots or partisans,"" and final votes look increasingly to take place with zero GOP backing.

Giuliani's travels aside, the Republican effort to portray as a circus what Democrats want to showcase as a sober responsibility has had some impact.

Democrats have been outspent in the impeachment fight, and are worried about being out-maneuvered. They still need to sort through their own conflicting instincts and political agendas before they can move on to the serious matter at hand.

The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks

Deadlines have a way of motivating Capitol Hill to get to work, but they are also often used by members as leverage.

In addition to the self-imposed pressure Democrats now face to work quickly on impeachment, there's also a fast-approaching deadline at the end of the month for Congress to pass a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that she did not think Congress was headed for a shutdown.

""I don't think anybody wants that. I think the president and the Republicans learned in the last shutdown that … there was no upside to it,"" Pelosi said on CNN Thursday. ""And we're on a good path.""
Of course, Republicans have accused Democrats of being obsessed with impeachment and laser-focused on that path alone.

Democrats face extra pressure to show constituents when they go home over the holiday that they're continuing to legislate. Republicans could easily exploit that vulnerability, and, as always, Trump's willingness to sign on to any deal will be unpredictable.

The TIP with Christopher Donato

After campaigning with former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa, former Secretary of State John Kerry hit the campaign trail for Biden in New Hampshire. Kerry, who told reporters after one event that he has ""no desire to serve"" in a Biden administration, made his pitch of support for Biden's presidential campaign.

Kerry is no stranger to New Hampshire, having won the First in the Nation primary in 2004. He told the crowds in Nashua and Hampton that he wasn't here ""just for any old reason"" and that his reason was because ""I know that Joe Biden is the person who can beat Donald Trump and bring this country back together and get the job done.""

The former secretary of state said it was important to have ""a president who understands that the next great infrastructure initiative of our nation is to meet the challenge of this crisis and to make it America ..."" and called out the president for his relationship with dictators such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

Kerry basked in the spotlight, speaking for over 30 minutes at both events. His home state of Massachusetts, just a few miles down the road, was on his mind.

""You're all very courageous,"" Kerry told the crowd in Hampton. ""I know the Patriots are playing. ... Joe Biden is like the Patriots. Fun to watch the promise and the potential of the young quarterbacks. But come February, I like having an experienced Tom Brady.""

Key players in the Trump impeachment probe and what they testified to Congress,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-testified-congress/story?id=66763043,"
Since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry in September, there has been a steady drumbeat of current and former administration and government officials who have come forward, either willingly or under subpoena, to testify in the rapidly developing probe.

At the heart of the inquiry is President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and whether the administration withheld nearly $400 million in aid and a White House summit between the two leaders in exchange for an investigation into the president’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Trump also allegedly wanted the aid withheld unless there was an investigation into a largely debunked theory that it was Ukrainians, not Russians, who tried to interfere in the 2016 election – on behalf of Hillary Clinton – and the Democrats' purported efforts on that front.

A number of questions surround the call, including Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s alleged role in lobbying the Ukrainian government through back channels, the involvement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and why exactly U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was recalled.

Democrats say the testimony, both from open proceedings and closed-door depositions, paints a picture of the president’s abuse of power to pursue politically motivated investigations. Republicans have raced to Trump’s defense, saying there was no evidence of a quid pro quo and that the witnesses did not have direct knowledge of Trump’s actions.

The House Judiciary Committee is set to hear this week from constitutional scholars and legal experts as it prepares to potentially draft articles of impeachment.

Here are the people who have testified so far and what they said:

ABC News' Benjamin Siegel, John Santucci, Katherine Faulders, Matthew Mosk, Ali Dukakis, Allison Pecorin, Laura Romero, Lucien Bruggeman, Soo Rin Kim, Justin Fishel, Megan Hughes, Jordyn Phelps, Shannon Crawford, Kathryn McQuade, Connor Finnegan and Cindy Smith contributed to this report."
"Senate Republicans blast Pelosi, House Democrats for pursuing impeachment",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-republicans-blast-pelosi-house-democrats-pursuing-impeachment/story?id=67524741,"
A “few” Senate Republicans agree that President Donald Trump's actions were impeachable, but they are unlikely to speak out against the president because they fear the political ramifications, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said Thursday.

“There are, I believe, a few Republicans who recognize that what President Trump did here was demonstrably impeachable, but who are very concerned about the political consequences for them and their party,” the Delaware senator said in an interview on CNN.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she has instructed House Democrats to begin the process to formally draw up articles of impeachment against Trump, saying he had abused his power ""for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security.""

""Sadly, but with confidence and humility ... today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,"" Pelosi said.
As the House prepares to draft articles of impeachment, lawmakers on the other side of the Capitol have begrudgingly begun preparing on their end, too.

“So much for being prayerful and thoughtful, I think it's a bad day for the country, I think this whole thing is a joke,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president’s top allies in the Senate, told reporters Thursday.

“I like Nancy Pelosi as a person, but this process has been hijacked,” Graham said. “I think the most radical people in the country are running, driving the impeachment process and either she gets on the train or she's going to get run over by it.”

Other senators, however, have said they’re ready to get the impeachment trial over with.

“I guess if you're going to come up with an inadequate case, you might as well go for the impeachment and have the circus,” Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., told reporters, adding that he's glad they're getting to it ""sooner rather than later.""
""I think time is somewhat of the essence. People are tired of it and there's an election coming,"" Cramer continued. ""I'm grateful for it. I'm glad. I'm anxious to see the articles and then look forward to sitting down for a trial.""

A top White House official delivered Trump's demands for a ""fair"" Senate trial to reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
""We believe very strongly, given the fatally flawed process in the House, that if they were to elect against our better advice to provide articles of impeachment -- send articles to the Senate -- that we need witnesses as part of our trial and full defense of the president on the facts,"" Eric Ueland, White House legislative affairs director said.

Coons said that because Republicans hold the majority in the Senate, it will be difficult for Democrats to stop them from pursuing live witnesses as part of the Senate’s impeachment trial, such as former Vice President Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden, or House Intelligence Committee Chairman, California Rep. Adam Schiff.

“I suspect Republicans would quickly come to regret giving [Biden] the opportunity to speak up about President Trump's role in interfering with Ukraine in such an unprecedented way,” Coons said on CNN. “Because the Republicans have the majority in the Senate and they ultimately could set the rules for this impeachment trial by a bare majority, there is very little Democrats in the Senate could do to stop them.""

Coons added, “We will be relying on a small number of Republicans who are pushing back against this idea and who recognize that impeachment is a serious, significant, constitutional moment.”
Meanwhile, some Republicans, like Cramer, do want to hear from witnesses like Schiff.

“I do think there's an increasing need for Chairman Schiff to have to testify. I think his motives ought to be brought into the scenario considering especially that he's now subpoenaed phone records of other members of Congress,” Cramer said. “I mean, clearly if other members of Congress, including on his committee, are under suspicion, then he certainly ought to be.”

The entire month of January remains a question mark on the official calendar, with senators acknowledging that an impeachment trial will likely suck up all of the “oxygen” in the room, leaving them no time to conduct other legislative business.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Pelosi and House Democrats for launching the impeachment inquiry in the face of unfinished legislative items, including funding the federal government ahead of a Dec. 20 deadline.

""Only in this town, only in Washington, D.C., does anybody think it’s okay for our armed forces to go unfunded ... and a major trade deal to go un-passed ... because Democrats are too busy hosting a panel of law professors to criticize President Trump on television,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, responded to McConnell, saying he was “simply wrong” for tarnishing the House Democrats’ impeachment process.

“It's so disheartening, confounding and deeply disappointing that at this historic moment I heard the Republican Leader criticizing in such strident terms the process of the impeachment inquiry in the House for being too short and not including enough witnesses or due process for the president,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.
He continued, “The charges against the president are extremely serious. No belittling of these charges will hold any water.”

Coons said Senate Democrats will continue to do work to get bills passed while the Democratic caucus continues the conversation on how they will respond during the proceedings.

“But, there hasn't been a serious beginning of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate about what the rules will be,” he said.

US Capitol Christmas tree lights up Washington,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-capitol-christmas-tree-lights-washington/story?id=67503909,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and representatives from New Mexico lit the U.S. Capitol Christmas tree Wednesday, heralding the holiday season in a traditional evening ceremony that dates back more than 50 years.

Asher Dean, a fourth grader from Arroyo Seco, New Mexico, who won an essay contest to participate in the ceremony, flipped the switch. He was joined by the first family of New Mexico and the state's congressional delegation.HAPPENING NOW: Speaker Nancy Pelosi lights the U.S. Capitol Christmas tree. https://t.co/YexMsvOHDC
After a 1,500-mile journey -- which began with its harvesting on Nov. 6 and included more than 25 stops across the country -- the massive 60-foot blue spruce from Carson National Forest in Red River, New Mexico, arrived in the nation's capital on Nov. 25 via flatbed truck. A large crane was used to lift it into place on the West Front Lawn.
The Architect of the Capitol's Grounds and Arboretum teams secured the spruce and decorated it with thousands of ornaments handcrafted by children from communities in the state.
This year’s theme highlighted the 75th birthday of the U.S Forest Service's most recognized fire prevention hero, Smokey Bear, who's based off a real-life cub that was found badly burned in the mountains of New Mexico.

Each year, in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Capitol Architect selects a tree from a different national forest. This year's tree was sponsored by the New Mexico Congressional Delegation, led by Democratic Sen. Tom Udall.It’s here! The enchanting Capitol Christmas Tree made its way from New Mexico to DC. Excited to see it light up the city with some NM magic. Thanks so much to everyone back home who made this happen— especially the incredible team at @CarsonNF. pic.twitter.com/SlWooOhF6F
Along with Pelosi, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham delivered remarks at the ceremony, calling it one of the highlights of her first year in office.

""Because this, in fact, is what the holiday season is about: reuniting with your families ... sharing all of our own unique traditions, family spirit, recommitting ourselves to the kind of quality of life and courage that makes a difference in the lives of every single American,"" Lujan Grisham, a former House representative, said.

The U.S. Army Brass Quintet and singer Chevel Shepherd performed during the ceremony.
The tradition of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree or ""The People’s Tree"" began in 1964, when House Speaker John W. McCormack, D-Mass., placed a live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. The tree lived for three years before succumbing to wind and root damage.
In 1970, the Capitol Architect formally asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide a Christmas tree. The chosen national forest also works with state forests to provide smaller, companion trees for other offices in Washington.

The tree will be lit from nightfall until 11 p.m. each evening through Jan. 1.

Trump stays friendly with Saudis despite FBI investigating Pensacola attack as terror,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-friendly-tone-saudis-attack-saudi-national-investigated/story?id=67603320,"
Even as the FBI investigates Friday's Pensacola Navy base shooting on the presumption it was an act of terror, President Donald Trump has maintained a trusting tone toward Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the condolences of the Saudi royal family and highlighting their offers of assistance.

After speaking with Saudi King Salman after the shooting, the president said the king and people of Saudi Arabia were “devastated” after a Saudi student national shot and killed three U.S. sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida.
“The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way, shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people, who love the American people so much,” the president said in remarks on Friday.

The president even suggested in comments on Saturday that the Saudi royal family would be providing financial assistance to the victims’ families.

“The King will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones.  He feels very strongly,” the president. “I think they're going to help out the families very greatly.”
In addition to speaking with the king, the president also spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman on Sunday. The White House said in a statement that the president expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s alliance and their assistance in the investigation during the call.

“The Crown Prince reiterated Saudi Arabia’s commitment to working with the United States to prevent a horrific attack like the Pensacola shooting from ever happening again.  The President thanked the Crown Prince for Saudi Arabia’s assistance with the investigation and continued partnership,"" the statement said.

The president's defense of Saudi Arabia comes as the FBI has said they are investigating the incident on the presumption that it was terror.

“We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,” Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jacksonville division, said.
The shooter, Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, was a student naval flight officer in the U.S. as part of a program under which the U.S. military provides training forces of allied countries that purchase American-made military aircraft. There are currently more than 850 Saudi nationals in the US for military training and 5,181 total foreign military students.

The shooter had been in the U.S. since 2017 as part of the training program and was scheduled to complete his training in August 2020.

While the president has maintained only a friendly tone toward Saudi Arabia, one of the president's staunchest congressional allies, Rep Matt Gaetz, has called on the U.S. to hit the pause button on accepting more Saudi students until the U.S. can establish confidence in its vetting program.  He also suggested the incident could change the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.

“Of course, what happened is Pensacola has to inform on our ongoing relationship with Saudi Arabia. That is the message I directly delivered to the Saudi Ambassador when she called to offer her condolences,” Gaetz said on ABC’s “This Week.”

DeVos defends handling of loan forgiveness program,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-condemn-education-secretary-betsy-devos-handling/story?id=67686388,"
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday as she appeared before the House Education and Labor committee to defend her handling of a student debt relief policy.

The policy, called ""Borrower’s Defense,"" is designed to offer debt relief to students who claim to have been defrauded by certain for-profit institutions.

DeVos argues that not all claims should be approved, stating in her written testimony that, ""if claims are false, or students did not suffer financial harm, then hardworking taxpayers should not pay their student loans for them. It’s a matter of fairness.""
Chairman Bobby Scott, D-Va., in his opening statement, said DeVos’ ""refusal to process claims is inflicting serious harm on the students you have a duty serve.""

""While the Department has been searching for a legal method of shortchanging defrauded borrowers, those defrauded borrowers have been left with mountains of debt, worthless degrees, and none of the job opportunities they were promised,"" Scott's opening statement said.
He added, ""In many cases, they have been unable to go back to school, start a family, and move on with their lives.""

Scott also accused the Education Department of ""illegally"" collecting on ""45,000 borrowers who are waiting for you to take action on their claims.""

""In some cases, these individuals had their wages and tax returns garnished by the very government that was supposed to be providing them relief,"" Scott said.

Republicans, however, defended DeVos and the department’s management of the claims.

""Claims that Secretary DeVos is unnecessarily or purposely delaying relief for these borrowers is false,"" Ranking member Virginia Foxx of North Carolina said in her opening statement.

""Secretary DeVos is putting reforms in place that will help defrauded students navigate the process of getting the loan relief they deserve,"" she said. ""And Committee Republicans are supportive of these efforts. Defrauded students who have been financially harmed should get relief.""
But the Republican defense didn’t stop Democrats from aggressively going after DeVos and her leadership at the department.
At one point during the hearing, Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida asked DeVos, ""Why has every decision you’ve made harmed students instead of empowering them?""

Wilson said that although in the past she has often disagreed with her Republican counterparts over their approach to education, she has ""never, not one time, believed they were out to destroy public education, until I met you,"" speaking to the secretary.

Wilson continued to condemn DeVos' leadership, ""You are the most unpopular person in our government, millions will register to vote in 2020, many will vote to remove you, more than to remove the president.""

Following Wilson’s remarks, Foxx said the claim that DeVos is trying to ""destroy public education"" was ""going too far.""

""That kind of comment cannot stand in this committee,"" Foxx said.

In her written testimony, DeVos said that she agreed that there is a backlog of claims at Federal Student Aid.

""To say that I am frustrated by that backlog is an understatement,"" she said in her written testimony. ""But rather than focus on why there is a backlog, too many have instead focused on creating a media circus.""

Trump calls Canadian prime minister 'two-faced' after conversation caught on camera,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-mock-trump-world/story?id=67485796,"
A candid moment caught on camera of Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau casually chatting with other world leaders has stirred speculation that the Canadian leader was mocking President Donald Trump, who in response called the Canadian leader ""two-faced.""

In video of a conversation with French President Emanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte during a reception Tuesday evening at Buckingham Palace, Johnson can be heard asking Macron, ""Is that why you were late?""
Macron’s response is inaudible on the video, but Trudeau then chimes in with a remark.

""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top,"" Trudeau says.
It is not clear who Trudeau is referring to, and Trump’s name is never specifically mentioned throughout the video of the captured conversation..@JustinTrudeau, @EmmanuelMacron, @BorisJohnson and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday. No one mentions @realDonaldTrump by name, but they seem to be discussing his lengthy impromptu press conferences from earlier in the day. (Video: Host Pool) pic.twitter.com/dVgj48rpOP
Trudeau can later be heard saying, ""You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""
Earlier in the day, Trump took reporters' questions for 39 minutes during a photo-op of his bilateral meeting with Macron. Later in the day, the president held a separate bilateral meeting with Trudeau, during which the president engaged with the press seated next to the Canadian prime minister for a half-hour.

Asked by ABC News if Trudeau was referring to Trump and to what the prime minister was discussing, Trudeau's office declined to comment.

On Wednesday morning, when a reporter asked Trump about the video, Trump called Trudeau ""two-faced.""

But then he added: ""And honestly with Trudeau, he's a nice guy, I find him to be a very nice guy.""

Trump said that he had ""called him out on the fact that"" Canada is spending less than 2% of its GDP on defense, to which NATO leaders had agreed and which Trump has made a signature issue.

""The truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2%, and I guess he's not very happy about it,"" Trump said, adding: ""So I called him out on that, and I'm sure he wasn't happy about it, but that's the way it is.""

But as he sat next to Trudeau in front of reporters on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he was ""happy with Canadian defense spending as it is right now,"" and said he was ""satisfied"" with Canada's increased levels of spending.

""Well, they’re moving up, and they’re moving up substantially,"" Trump said. ""And they’re starting to do very well, economically. And that has something to do with it. And, yeah, they’re getting up to a level that's getting to be very acceptable. They have been under the 2%, obviously, but they’re moving up. We discuss it. I’m satisfied with it.""

Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's most recent statements about the Canadian prime minister on Wednesday."
Elizabeth Warren discloses she made nearly $2 million in past legal work,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-discloses-made-million-legal-work/story?id=67586565,"
Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign described for the first time the majority of the paychecks she received during her time as a lawyer, a move that comes on the heels of repeated pressure from South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Warren made around $1.9 million in compensation from private legal work dating back to 1985, according to documents released Sunday night.

Warren represented, consulted for or provided expert witness to a handful of big corporations from 1985 through 2009, around the time she was teaching law at Harvard University. According to the documents released by the campaign, Warren's income from the casework ranged from less than $10,000 to as much as $212,000.
For five different cases out of around 50, her campaign reported it was unable to find compensation records. It is unclear how much she made on those cases.

In a handful of cases, the campaign also pointed out that some of the money Warren made as a corporate lawyer was included in the tax returns, dating back to 2008, she's already released.

According to the campaign, the income details were pieced together from public records and campaign research. ABC News has not independently confirmed the compensation details.
""Any candidate who refuses to provide basic details about his or her own record and refuses to allow voters or the press to understand who is buying access to their time and what they are getting in return will be seen by voters as part of the same business-as-usual politics that voters have consistently rejected,"" Kristen Orthman, Warren's campaign communications director, said in a statement.
Warren's campaign first released a list of her former corporate clients in 2012, as she came under pressure from Republican opponents to be more transparent. At the time, Warren had called on her opponents to disclose their own corporate ties.

This latest move Sunday evening comes after Buttigieg called for Warren to release her tax returns from before 2008 and detail compensation earned by representing different corporations, a move Buttigieg's campaign argued was in the interest of transparency.

Buttigieg, however, has also separately been under pressure to put out more details about his time working for a large corporation, the consulting firm McKinsey and Co.

Many have called on the candidate to break a non-disclosure agreement he signed with his former employer and disclose for whom he worked and when. Though he has not committed to releasing the names of former clients, he recently told reporters the company is putting him ""in a difficult position"" and that it's ""very important"" to offer ""as much transparency as possible.""

Warren dismissed Buttigieg's calls to see more of her tax returns, instead pointing to the closed-door fundraisers held by his campaign.

""Look, I understand he would like to deflect from what he's doing right now, but he's gonna be in New York next week. And he's gonna do three big fundraisers with rich people,"" Warren told reporters on Friday. ""He should open up the doors and let someone from the press come in and hear what promises he's making to rich folks and what he's saying that's different from what he says when he's out on the trail.""

As a candidate for the presidency, Warren has pledged not to attend closed-door, high-dollar fundraisers for her campaign. She does, however, attend Democratic National Committee fundraisers and her campaign has held fundraisers where she is not in attendance.

In recent days, Buttigieg has told reporters his campaign is considering opening up fundraisers typically closed to press.

Warren also has defended her decision not to release her tax returns prior to 2008, saying she'd already put out 11 years of returns.

""That's exactly 11 years more than Donald Trump. It is three years more than Barack Obama did at the same point. And I have already put out a list of all of the legal work that I did in all the years that I was in teaching, at least everything that I could find,"" Warren told reporters in New Hampshire Saturday.
Warren doesn't intend to release additional returns. Her campaign on Sunday emphasized that point, adding that her returns also don't itemize income earned from individual cases as do the documents just released.

The release reveals a range of work Warren did in each case, from testifying as an expert witness against Phillip Morris International, a tobacco company, to representing a plaintiff on toxic waste dumping in Massachusetts during the 1980s, to her work with Dow Corning as the chemical company sought to staunch its liability in a large class-action suit over silicone breast implants.

The case summaries put out by the Warren campaign buttress her brand of working-class advocacy, though that's not how some involved with the cases recall Warren's role.

""Elizabeth served as a consultant to ensure adequate compensation for women who claimed injury from silicone breast implants who otherwise might not have received anything when Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy,"" according to the description of one case from the Warren campaign. ""Thanks in part to Elizabeth's efforts, Dow Corning created a $2.35 billion fund to compensate women claiming injury from Dow Corning's silicone breast implants. The vast majority of women with claims against Dow Corning supported the creation of this fund.""

But Sybil Goldrich, a top consumer advocate and the trustee for the 138,000 plaintiffs in the Dow settlement, told ABC News in October that Warren's work effectively froze all lawsuits nationwide -- both individual and class-action litigation -- and that the first settlement checks weren't issued until years later, in 2004. Part of the delay involved appeals to the settlement agreement lodged by individual plaintiff attorneys.

During that time, many of the older women -- some who got breast implants as far back as the early 1960s -- passed away, while another 20% of plaintiffs continued to suffer from breast cancer.

Warren's compensation for that case was $19,942, according to the campaign.

In another case, on behalf of plane manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft after a crash that killed four people, including NASCAR star Alan Kulwicki, Warren argued that the manufacturer should be shielded from liability because the plane that went down was made by a company that had gone bankrupt. The court ruled against that stance, later vacating the decision. Warren was paid $9,812 for that case.

""Elizabeth represented the company in a lawsuit to try to protect hundreds of jobs at the company after new investors had saved it from closing its doors and laying off its workers,"" the Warren campaign wrote in its description of the case. ""In the end, the company survived and 1,000 people had jobs because of it.""

Bill Weld: Everything you need to know about the 2020 presidential candidate,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-weld-2020-presidential-candidate/story?id=67421285,"
Former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld became the first Republican to mount a long-shot primary challenge against President Donald Trump. He announced his candidacy for president on April 15, 2019. The 2016 Libertarian vice presidential candidate told ABC News he would have been ""ashamed"" if he'd passed up on running against the president for the Republican nomination. Weld has touted his bipartisan record and ability to court independent voters in early voting states as his pathway to the White House.
Name: William ""Bill"" Floyd Weld

Party: Republican -- with a stint in the Libertarian Party from 2016-2019

Date of birth: July 31, 1945

Age: 74

Hometown: Smithtown, New York
Family: Weld has five adult children -- David, Ethel, Mary, Quentin and Frances -- with his first wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, a great-granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt. Now, Weld lives in Canton, Massachusetts, with his wife, author Leslie Marshall, and has three adult stepchildren.

Education: Weld graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College with a bachelor of arts degree in Classics in 1966. He received an international economics degree from Oxford University the following year, before returning to Harvard Law School and graduating in 1970.
What he does now: After announcing his candidacy, Weld took an unpaid leave of absence from Mintz Levin law firm. He is currently a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and an associate member of the InterAction Council. He also sits on the board of directors of cannabis company Acreage Holdings, alongside former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and on the board of Just Energy Group Inc.

What he used to do: Weld ran as the vice presidential nominee on the 2016 Libertarian ticket. He served as governor of Massachusetts from 1991-1997. He previously served at least seven years as a federal prosecutor, first as U.S. attorney for the district of Massachusetts from 1981-1986 and then as U.S. assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department from 1986-1988. Early in his career, Weld participated in the Watergate impeachment inquiry as legal counsel on the House Judiciary Committee.
Key life/career moments:

Weld began his legal career as junior counsel on the House Judiciary Committee's staff in the Watergate impeachment inquiry. After working as a staffer in Congress and then as a private attorney in Boston, President Ronald Reagan appointed Weld as U.S. attorney for the district of Massachusetts in 1981. Five years later, Reagan promoted Weld to assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department.

Weld was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1990, becoming the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in the state in 20 years. During his governorship, Weld cut taxes 21 times, led 16 international trade missions, oversaw six upgrades for the state's bond ratings, expanded abortion access and broadened LGBTQ rights, according to his campaign website. He was regarded as one of the most fiscally conservative governors in the country.

In 1996, Weld ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate, losing to John Kerry. Weld resigned as governor in 1997 to pursue a nomination by President Bill Clinton as the U.S. ambassador to Mexico but withdrew his nomination after former Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., effectively blocked it in committee. For the next decade, Weld worked a variety of legal and financial jobs including a stint as the chief executive officer of Decker College in Louisville, Kentucky. He re-entered the political sphere in 2005, in an unsuccessful bid for governor of New York.

Weld ran for vice president of the United States in 2016 on the Libertarian ticket with Gary Johnson. He returned to the Republican party in early 2019 when he announced his presidential exploratory committee.
Where he stands on some issues:

Weld has positioned himself as a Republican who blends fiscal conservatism with social liberalism. His campaign told ABC News that getting their candidate on a debate stage with the president is a top priority -- but that's unlikely to take place.

""The RNC and the Republican Party are firmly behind the president. Any effort to challenge the president's nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere,"" a RNC spokeswoman told ABC News in July.

In his first 100 days in office, Weld said he would first tackle cutting spending and rebuilding relations with close U.S. allies.

Weld strongly opposes Trump's tariffs and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal but has agreed with him on wanting to remove troops from Afghanistan, according to Axios. His website indicates that on the economy, Weld supports tax cuts and reigning in spending. On social issues, Weld supports gay marriage, abortion rights and marijuana legalization.

Weld's campaign website prioritizes the issues of ""income inequality, debts and deficits, and climate change."" He said he would have the U.S. rejoin the Paris climate accord.
Fundraising:

As of July 2019, Weld's campaign told ABC News that since entering the race in mid-April, they raised nearly $700,000 from 7,000 total donors. On top of supporter contributions, Weld gave at least $181,000 of his own money to the campaign, bringing the second quarter total to $869,000. The average donation for the quarter was $98, according to the campaign.

Weld reported $208,043 cash on hand following the third quarter deadline in mid-October.

During the 2016 presidential race, when Weld ran on the Libertarian ticket, he accepted donations from super PACs.
What you might not know about him:

In 1994, Weld was reelected as Massachusetts governor with 71% of the vote, the largest margin of victory in state history.

Weld's family traces its history back to America's early days, with one of his ancestors' graduating from Harvard College in 1650 and another, William Floyd, signing the Declaration of Independence.

Former special counsel Robert Mueller's sole federal contribution on record went to Weld in 1996 -- two checks totaling $450 during Weld's U.S. Senate race, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

In his time between serving as Massachusetts governor and running for New York governor, Weld published three novels.

Pensacola shooting suspect identified as Saudi national: Why was he there?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pensacola-naval-base-shooting-suspect-identified-member-saudi/story?id=67555812,"
Friday's shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, in which four people, including the shooter, died, marks the second time this week gun violence erupted at a U.S. military installation.

But while Wednesday's shooting in Hawaii was related to a domestic issue, the attack on Friday became international incident after it was reported the suspect was a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force.

Mohammed Alshamrani, according to authorities, was one of about 200 foreign nationals receiving training on the naval air base as part of a program in which U.S. allies send members of their armed forces there to study aviation.

Alshamrani's training on the base, which included English language and basic aviation courses, started in August 2017 and was scheduled to finish by August 2020, according to the Department of Defense.

His participation in the program is part of a military practice that goes back decades, NAS Pensacola base commander Capt. Timothy Kinsella said during a press conference in the aftermath of the shooting

""The cross-training with allies is something that we have done for a long time,"" he said. ""In World War II, we had Royal Air Force folks training here.""
Saudi Arabia, according to the Pentagon, is one such ally, and has supplied 852 of the more than 5,000 foreign military students spread throughout the U.S.

Germany, Singapore, Italy, Denmark and Norway have also sent students to Naval Air Station Pensacola, also known as the ""Cradle of Naval Aviation.""

NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. The facility includes the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Marine Aviation Training Support Group 21 and 23, the Blue Angels and the headquarters for Naval Education Training Command.

According to Kinsella, only authorized security forces are allowed to carry weapons on the base. It's still unclear how Alshamrani was able to bring a handgun into the classroom and begin shooting.

And while Alshamrani's motive remains unclear, law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News authorities are focusing on two possibilities: that he was acting for ideological reasons, or that some kind of hostilities developed over the course of his training.
Shortly after the shooting, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saudi Arabia was ""going to owe a debt here,"" and numerous Saudi officials condemned the attack in statements.

""Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime. The Kingdom expresses its deepest condolences to the families of victims, and to the American people. We salute the bravery of those who neutralized the threat and saved lives,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan tweeted.Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime.

The Kingdom expresses its deepest condolences to the families of victims, and to the American people. We salute the bravery of those who neutralized the threat and saved lives.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters on Friday that the vetting process for foreign military nationals in the U.S., including screenings by the Department of Defense and U.S. embassy personnel, will be reviewed.

""I want to make sure we're doing our due diligence,"" Esper said, ""to understand what are our procedures.""

Biden says he will not appear at Senate impeachment trial despite demands from Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-official-trump-full-senate-trial-live/story?id=67502822,"
Former Vice President Joe Biden is responding unequivocally to a top White House official who said Wednesday that President Donald Trump is demanding a full Senate trial, featuring live witnesses, if and when the House  sends over articles of impeachment: He does not plan to attend voluntarily.

""No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,"" Biden said outside a campaign event in Iowa Falls, Iowa, on Wednesday afternoon. ""The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes, and I’m not going to let him divert from that. I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.""
Eric Ueland, White House legislative affairs director, delivered Trump's demands to reporters on Capitol Hill earlier in the day.

""We believe very strongly, given the fatally flawed process in the House, that if they were to elect against our better advice to provide articles of impeachment -- send articles to the Senate -- that we need witnesses as part of our trial and full defense of the president on the facts,"" Ueland said.

Ueland gaggled with a handful of reporters just steps away from the Senate chamber for roughly 20 minutes following a closed-door lunch meeting with Senate Republicans on impeachment strategy.
Also in attendance during the luncheon: White House counsel Pat Cipollone, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and former Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh -- the latter two have both been charged with handling the administration's communication strategy on impeachment.

""The underlying impeachment rules of the Senate afford the president a full suite of rights to argue his case on the facts and on the merits,"" Ueland said. ""That's why we believe quite strongly that in order to make the president's whole case in contradiction to a partisan process which doesn't allow him to make his full case, that we need both a full trial and the opportunity to call witnesses and work a trial over here on the Senate floor.""

He suggested the White House wants live witnesses as part of the trial, instead of relying on videotaped depositions like the ones entered into evidence during former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. Ueland did not, however, provide details as to who those witnesses might be.
""The president wants his case made fully in the Senate with a full trial and that’s a point we’re going to make consistently,"" Ueland said.

Republican senators coming out of the meeting offered no additional insights on the process of a potential trial, with many saying they are simply waiting to see what the House ends up doing.

""It was an opportunity for our members to ask questions, for some to offer comments, but you know again it's a fluid process, there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding this,"" South Dakota Sen. John Thune said.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called the discussion ""free-ranging"" and broad in scope.

""There was nothing designed in my view to sway anybody one way or the other To be honest, it was really not very -- I hate to say this because, you know I've been to the White House for the lunch meetings -- it's pretty much the same stuff,"" North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said.

""There was nothing new or a revelation, just a discussion of what might occur,"" Indiana Sen. Mike Braun said in agreement.
Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt gave a small glimpse into what the proposed strategy will be for Senate Republicans.

""Well, the strategy is what the leader talked about the other day: when it gets to the Senate he will decide what the calendar looks like and how much willingness there is to have an agreement, a bipartisan agreement, and if not, how much willingness there is to have 51 votes to either amend or move forward with the current Senate rules,"" Blunt said.

He continued: ""I do think that the president's counsel said enough times -- and he wanted to be sure that we heard it -- that even though they're talking about what they may do if it comes here - they clearly don't believe, based on what's happened so far, that the House should send it here.""
The Republican-controlled Senate also released its 2020 calendar without anything scheduled for the month of January due to the uncertainty surrounding the impeachment trial.

""The only thing I know for sure is that nobody knows what we're doing in January yet,"" Cramer said. ""I think it's just prudent planning.

""January will be a little on the fly,"" Thune said.

Blunt weighed in as well, saying ""often there’s a break around Martin Luther King Day and other things that may very well not happen if we're involved in the impeachment process.""

Cramer added, ""Worst case scenario, let's hope.""
While Senate Republicans met with White House officials to discuss strategy, Senate Democrats said they are preparing for a potential trial, too.

A source close to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the senator gave a presentation during their caucus lunch ""confined to the mechanics of a potential Senate trial because articles have not been drafted.""

""As a part of Schumer’s presentation, members were shown video clips from the 1999 trial to familiarize themselves with the process,"" the aide said.

The aide added that only seven of the current 47 Senate Democrats were in the Senate during Clinton's 1999 trial."
WH won't participate in impeachment: Official,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-participate-house-impeachment-proceedings-source/story?id=67551511,"
The White House sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler Friday afternoon blasting the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, and while it doesn't say explicitly that President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not participate in their upcoming proceedings, a senior White House official told ABC News the point of the letter is that they won't take part.

""House Democrats have wasted enough of America's time with this charade,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote. ""You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings.""

""Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats, and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan, and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our Nation's history,"" he said.

""We don't see any reason to participate because the process is unfair. Speaker Pelosi had already announced the predetermined result. They will not give us the ability to call any witnesses,"" a senior administration official told ABC News.   PACLetter2019.06.12 by Anonymous TjVFb1a9 on Scribd
In a letter last week, Nadler asked the president to notify the committee by Friday at 5 p.m. whether his lawyers would participate in any of their proceedings and whether they plan to present a defense. The Judiciary Committee announced a hearing on Monday in which lawyers for the Democrats and Republicans from the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committee's will present findings from the investigations.
The absence of White House participation follows weeks of vocal protests from the president and Republicans in Congress, who have accused Democrats of blocking their due process rights. In a previous letter to Nadler, the White House argued it could not be expected to participate in the hearing with constitutional scholars because the committee provided them little information about it. The White House said it would consider participating in upcoming proceedings if the committee conducted a ""fair process going forward.""

However, the White House is preparing an aggressive defense of the president for a Senate trial if and when the House sends over articles of impeachment.
""The underlying impeachment rules of the Senate afford the president a full suite of rights to argue his case on the facts and on the merits,"" Eric Ueland, legislative affairs director for the White House, told reporters. ""That's why we believe quite strongly that in order to make the president's whole case, in contradiction to a partisan process which doesn't allow him to make his full case, that we need both a full trial and the opportunity to call witnesses and work a trial over here on the Senate floor.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday she had instructed House Democrats to draw up articles of impeachment of Trump, saying he'd abused his power.

""Sadly, but with confidence and humility ... today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,"" she said. ""The facts are uncontested. The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security by withholding military aid and a crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into his political rival.""
Articles of impeachment could be drafted and introduced next week. That will set up a public committee hearing to mark up and approve the articles, sending them to the House floor. That could happen as early as the week after the Monday hearing.

Democrats are still on track to vote and pass articles of impeachment out of the House the week before Christmas. "
National GOP breaks with House candidate who says 'traitors' should be 'hanged',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-republicans-break-gop-house-candidate-traitors-hanged/story?id=67497549,"
National Republicans are breaking with a U.S. House recruit, George Buck, who is running in Florida's competitive 13th Congressional District, after he sought donations from supporters by insinuating that several Democrats, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, should be hanged.

In a fundraising email sent last week, the Republican candidate's campaign for the St. Petersburg-area seat, singled out Omar and falsely accused the Somali-born Democrat, elected in last year's midterms, of working for the country of Qatar and asserted she should be punished, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The email also mentions Buck's Democratic rival, incumbent Rep. Charlie Crist, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

""We should hang these traitors where they stand,"" the email reads, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The campaign literature does not explicitly state who he is referring to as alleged traitors, the paper reported.

ABC News has not independently reviewed the campaign literature.
Buck initially told the Tampa Bay Times he did not write the email, even though it included his signature, adding, ""I would never talk like that.""

In a statement to ABC News Wednesday, when asked about the fundraising email and the NRCC's decision, Buck asserted that treason is a crime punishable by death.

""I am a decorated veteran of the 101st Airborne Division. As someone who has taken the oath to defend the Constitution, I take that oath very seriously,"" he said in the statement. ""Anyone who commits treason against the United States should be tried to the full extent of the law.""

""Treason is one of the few crimes the Constitution has as punishable by death,"" he added.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, he also said, ""Any Republican who calls me out for my rhetoric but doesn't call out the Democrats for theirs are hypocrites.""

Buck did not respond when asked by ABC News if he is suggesting Omar or the other Democrats mentioned in his campaign literature committed treason.

Omar's campaign did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., disavowed Buck's email, saying in a statement Wednesday, ""there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.""

""Instead of doubling down on these disgraceful comments, the candidate ought to apologize unequivocally and denounce these unacceptable statements,"" he continued.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm, dropped Buck from its ""Young Guns"" program, the party's recruitment and mentoring program for rising House candidates running in competitive races -- a move that distances the GOP from the controversial candidate who is standing by the email.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made the decision to remove Buck from the program, and NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer, a Minnesota congressman, agreed with the decision, according to a committee spokesperson. Buck was announced as a member of the program on Oct. 30, alongside 23 other Republicans.

Tlaib, one of Omar's key allies, quickly came to her defense, condemning Buck's email in a tweet: ""The fact that those who make these violent threats very publicly without hesitation reaffirms just how much white supremacy has spread within the @NRCC. They are raising money on a call to hang a Black Muslim member of Congress and too many are silent. @IlhanMN.""

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump has frequently ridiculed Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley--four minority congresswomen who have dubbed themselves the ""Squad"" on the campaign trail, drawing criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for his rhetoric.

Ocasio Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib were born in the U.S., and Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee when she was a child, has been living in the country since she was 12 years old and is a U.S. citizen. In the 2018 midterm elections, all four women won a popular vote to claim their seats in Congress.

Trump has particularly targeted Omar calling her ""an America-hating socialist.""

The president threaded a vicious string of verbal attacks against Omar at an October campaign rally in her home district, calling out her positions on Israel, which elicited scattered ""send her back"" chants from the crowd.

""She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months,"" he continued.
Buck isn't the only congressional candidate to take aim at Omar.

Twitter suspended the account of Danielle Stella, Omar's Republican opponent in the 5th Congressional District race, after she falsely suggested the congresswoman may have passed intel to Iran and should be ""tried for treason and hanged,"" according to the New York Times referencing a screenshot of a tweet sent from her account.

ABC News did not review the original tweet, which can no longer be accessed.

Omar previously denied the allegations made against her according to The Jerusalem Post. Her office told the New York Times that such stories are “outlandishly absurd.”

Senate confirms nomination of Dan Brouillette to replace Energy Secretary Rick Perry,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-advances-nomination-dan-brouillette-replace-energy-secretary/story?id=67204267,"
The U.S. Senate voted 70-15 to confirm the nomination of Dan Brouillette as energy secretary on Monday, following Rick Perry's official resignation from the position one day prior.

""Together, we will build upon the historic progress in energy made under Secretary Perry’s leadership, making our country safer, more prosperous, and secure,"" Brouillette said in a statement released by the Department of Energy. ""I am excited for what the future holds, as our Department continues to make a lasting impact both domestically and around the world.""

Perry posted a farewell on Twitter.

""It has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime to serve in the @realDonaldTrump Administration as your Secretary. Thank you to my wife, my children, and to the American people for allowing me to serve. Signing off. – RP,"" Perry said in an official statement tweeted on Sunday.

Today I bid farewell to the Department of @ENERGY. It has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime to serve in the @realDonaldTrump Administration as your Secretary. Thank you to my wife, my children, and to the American people for allowing me to serve. Signing off. – RP pic.twitter.com/AlxYNLsqrf
— Rick Perry (@SecretaryPerry) December 2, 2019

Brouillette is the 15th U.S. Secretary of Energy. An official swearing in ceremony will take place at a later date, the Department of Energy said in a statement.

Trump formally nominated Brouillette on Nov. 7 as Perry prepared to step down, amid scrutiny over the role he played in the president's dealings with Ukraine.

Prior to Monday's confirmation, Brouillette had served as deputy energy secretary since August 2017, when he was confirmed in a bipartisan 79-17 vote. In that role, he led day-to-day operations at the Department of Energy under Perry.
Last month, during Brouillette's nomination hearing before the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., pressed Brouillette on his knowledge of conversations between Perry, Naftogaz -- a Ukrainian oil and gas company -- and President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

""Are you aware of the nature of any communications with Naftogaz?"" Wyden asked. ""Because initially you said you knew there were communications, so being the deputy, I'd be inclined to say somebody like yourself -- who's knowledgeable, I've watched you over the years -- would know a little bit about the nature of the conversations.""

Brouillette repeatedly said during the hearing that he wasn't aware of or a part of the conversations.

""I wasn't party to that, I didn't have any knowledge of that,"" he said in response to Wyden. ""I am aware that within the department there are technical experts that from time-to-time will interact with colleagues about these types of matters. But I'm not aware of any conversations between the secretary and anyone at Naftogaz.""

Brouillette also praised nuclear energy and new carbon capture technologies at the Nov. 15 hearing, while claiming that non-renewable energy sources are still a necessity for the U.S.

""We are on the cutting edge of a number of exciting technologies like advanced nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy storage,” Brouillette said. “If we care about the carbon impact, we need to get these technologies off of the shelf and into the market.""

Trump announced his plans to nominate Brouillette on Twitter back in October, one day after Perry -- who has been described by colleagues as one of the ""three amigos"" on U.S. policy on Ukraine -- announced his impending resignation from the Energy Department's top job.....He is also my friend! At the same time, I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy. Dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!
Broulliette responded with a video on Twitter, tagging the president.

""I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve in your cabinet and I am ready to get to work,"" Brouillette wrote.
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for nominating me to be your next @Energy Secretary. I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve in your cabinet and I am ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/agyEJzXF6K
Perry also released a statement wishing his deputy success.

""I have the utmost confidence the Department of Energy will continue to thrive under Dan Brouillette,"" Perry said in the statement. ""Dan has faithfully served as my Deputy, helping to advance American energy security and position the United States as the world's premier energy leader.""
Prior to becoming the deputy energy secretary, Brouillette served as chief of staff to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was assistant secretary of energy for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration.

Before joining the Trump administration in 2017, he most recently worked as an executive at the United Services Automobile Association and the Ford Motor Co. He also served as a member of Louisiana's State Mineral and Energy Board.

Brouillette is a Louisiana native, graduate of the the University of Maryland and longtime resident of San Antonio, Texas. He and his wife, Adrienne, are U.S. Army veterans and have nine children together.

US seizes Iranian weapons and missile parts headed to Yemen in northern Arabian Sea,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-seizes-iranian-missile-parts-headed-yemen/story?id=67500074,"
The U.S. military seized a ""cache of weapons and advanced missile components"" believed to be of Iranian origin in the northern Arabian Sea, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.

The small vessel carrying the weapons, referred to as a dhow, was believed to be headed to Yemen, a U.S. official told ABC News, where the missile parts would likely support Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The dhow carried dissembled part for anti-ship cruise missiles, land attack cruise missiles, air defense missiles and anti-tank missiles, the official said.
""On November 25th, a U.S. warship conducted a flag verification boarding in the Arabian sea in accordance with international law of what was subsequently determined to be a stateless vessel, and discovered a cache of weapons and advanced missile components,"" said Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson in a statement. ""An initial investigation indicates that these advanced missile components are of Iranian origin. A more thorough investigation is underway.""

The USS Forrest Sherman, a Navy destroyer, interdicted the dhow early last week in the northern Arabian Sea, and a U.S. Coast Guard boarding party seized the guided-missile parts, a second U.S. official said.
The dhow's crew was held aboard the U.S. destroyer while the missile components were transferred aboard the ship, that official said. The crew has already been released and given to Yemeni authorities, the first official said, but it's unclear where the dhow and crew were transferred.

The Associated Press, which was first to report the seizure, said it was the first time that such sophisticated components have been taken en route to the war in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning, a top Pentagon official said that the U.S. continues to see ""indications"" that Iranian aggression could occur. That warning came one day after CNN reported that ""fresh intelligence"" showed there is a ""potential Iranian threat against U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East,"" as evidenced by the movement of Iranian forces and weapons in the region.

""We also continue to see indications, and for obvious reasons I won't go into the details, that potential Iranian aggression could occur,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood told a small group of reporters.
Rood said that in the aftermath of Iranian attacks over the summer -- attacks which targeted commercial ships, a Saudi oil facility and a U.S. drone -- the U.S. moved about 14,000 additional U.S. troops into the Middle East and ""stepped up messaging"" to Iran in order to discourage further attacks.

""Watch this space,"" he said. ""I think we're going to be dynamic in our deployments, in our response and how we message. In private, you should know we've sent very clear and blunt signals to the Iranian government about the potential consequences of aggression.""

The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group was one of the U.S. assets rushed to the Middle East in May to deter what at the time appeared to be imminent threats to U.S. interests and forces in the region from Iran.

The carrier transited the Strait of Hormuz out of the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, after spending almost two weeks there. While in the Persian Gulf, the Lincoln made a port call in Bahrain, the first port visit during its Middle East deployment that is expected to come to an end soon with the expected arrival of the USS Harry S. Truman."
Federal appeals court sides with Congress in battle for Trump's bank records,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-appeals-court-orders-deutsche-bank-turn-records/story?id=67463368,"
A New York federal appeals court ruled Tuesday morning that Deutsche Bank must turn over copies of President Donald Trump's financial records subpoenaed by the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees, marking the latest blow to the president's effort to keep his financial records private.

The appellate judges in the ruling wrote that a lower court must determine how to disclose the information without revealing personal information.

Two of the appellate judges signed onto the opinion, while one other judge concurred in part and dissented in part.

The opinion does not mention the ongoing impeachment inquiry proceedings explicitly, but notes that they had been considered in a separate ongoing lawsuit involving Trump's financial records.
Circuit Court Judge Jon Newman in the opinion stated that, ""the interests of Congress in pursuing the investigations for which the challenged subpoenas were issued substantially 'overbalance' the privacy interests invaded by disclosure of financial documents,"" describing the public need for the congressional investigation as ""of the highest order.""

""The legislative purposes of the investigations concern national security and the integrity of elections,"" Newman wrote, while he also noting that the privacy interests concerning disclosure of Trump's private financial documents might ""distract"" the president's performance of his official duties.

The opinion also notes that Trump was subpoenaed for documents related to his personal dealings, and not his business in an official capacity.

""The Second Circuit decision is another in a long line of decisions strongly affirming 'a broad power of Congress and its committees to obtain information in aid of its legislative authority under Article I of the Constitution,"" Chairman Adam Schiff and Chairwoman Maxine Waters said in a statement. ""The decision today also affirmed that the subpoenas issued by the House Financial Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have a valid legislative purpose.""
""We believe the subpoena is invalid as issued,"" Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys, told ABC News in a statement. ""In light of the Second Circuit decision, we are evaluating our next options including seeking review at the Supreme Court of the United States.""

Brianne Gorod, chief counsel for the Washington-based nonprofit Constitutional Accountability Center and an expert in the constitution law, told ABC News that the ruling is a ""resounding victory"" not only for House Democrats but also for the rule of law.

""Congressional oversight has deep roots in our nation's legal and political tradition, and the House subpoenas at issue in this case fall well within Congress's broad oversight authority,"" Corod said in a statement. ""Moreover, the public interest strongly supports allowing Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House's subpoenas because, as Judge Newman rightly recognized, ""(t)he public interest in vindicating the Committees' constitutional authority is clear and substantial.""
Tuesday's decision follows a series of other court rulings that have taken the side against the president in his fight to shield his tax returns.

Earlier this year, both the district court and appeals court in Washington sided with House Democrats in the president's lawsuit against the House Oversight Committee's subpoena for financial records from the Trump Organization's accounting firm Mazars. Similarly, a New York district court and the appeals court both sided with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office seeking the president's tax returns.
Both the House Democrats' case and the Manhattan DA's case have been brought up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and both of the lower courts' orders have been temporarily halted while the highest court of the country reviews the cases.

In another lawsuit involving Trump's New York state tax returns, a federal judge in D.C. ruled that Congress must notify the president before it requests his state tax returns under a new state law that allows disclosure of the president's state tax returns, and that the request will trigger a 14-day review period by the court before the Congress obtains the records."
"In heart-wrenching case, Supreme Court examines international child custody battle",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heart-wrenching-case-supreme-court-examines-international-child/story?id=67660182,"
A heart-wrenching child custody battle between an American mother, who alleges she's a victim of domestic abuse, and her Italian ex-husband played out before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday.

In the middle is the couple's 4 and a half-year-old daughter -- identified in court documents by her initials ""A.M.T."" -- born in Italy, ferried by the mother to the U.S. at two months old, but later ordered by a court to return to Italy when the father filed a lawsuit.
The case, involving the Hague Convention of 1980, represented a rare instance of child custody issues before the nation's highest court. The family drama captivated the justices and clearly pulled at heartstrings.
The mother, Michelle Monasky, pleaded with the justices in court documents, saying the transatlantic separation is ""not only deeply hurtful... but also highly detrimental to [her daughter's] development.""

The father, Domenico Taglieri, who won parental rights in an Italian court after Monasky fled with their baby to the U.S., says the international treaty dictates that his child's ""habitual residence"" shall be Italy.
The Supreme Court will now decide whether it agrees with Taglieri, or whether A.M.T. should be returned to her mother in the U.S. The court could also establish a clear standard for determining an infant's ""habitual residence"" and how lower court's should apply it going forward.

During oral arguments, however, the justices seemed very wary of getting deeply involved.
""We're talking about an international convention, but none of the other parties have adopted your position,"" a skeptical Chief Justice John Roberts told Monasky's attorney, who argues his client's intent to live in the U.S. should be overriding.

""Why should it be here instead of there?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, sharing her skepticism. ""Why is it an American court rather than Italian court dealing with this custody issue?""
Justice Stephen Breyer outright opposed ""laying down black letter rules"" to govern custody battles.

""This is family law. Families differ,"" Breyer quipped. ""How do we know what's in the best interest of a child? Federal judges don't know much about this.""
The Trump administration also participated in the argument opposing ""rigid per se tests"" to establishing a child's habitual residency for purposes of custody.

Habitual residency ""is a meaningless concept when you're talking about someone eight weeks old,"" Roberts said. ""They don't even have habits... well, except one or two.""

The court room erupted into laughter.
Monasky did receive some sympathy from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who noted that some accommodation might be necessary in difficult international cases of a mother fleeing violence.

""This is a troublesome case because she alleged she was abused,"" Ginsburg told attorney Andrew Pincus, representing the father, Taglieri. ""So you're saying if she wants to escape domestic violence, she has to leave her child behind?""
Pincus told the court, in an apparent attempt to show some deference to court sympathy for Monasky, that an Italian court is preparing to revisit the parental custody rights of A.M.T. in the future. He said that both parents currently have rights to see the child.

The Supreme Court will issue it's decision by the end of June.  "
Tulsi Gabbard moves to New Hampshire as candidate places bets on state's primary,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-moves-hampshire-candidate-places-bets-states/story?id=67504440,"
A two-day snowstorm wasn't enough to scare off Hawaii-native Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from New Hampshire. In fact, she's officially moved to the state.

While other candidates are focusing on Iowa, Gabbard is placing her bets on New Hampshire. Gabbard is one poll short of the four needed to qualify for the December debate stage; two of the qualifying polls were from New Hampshire.

At 5%, Gabbard was tied for fifth place in the Oct. 29 CNN/University of New Hampshire poll of likely primary voters in the state. However, nationally, she received just 2% support, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Nov. 3.
""We had a town hall in Rochester and then in Gilford right before the storm hit and people said, 'You must be getting out of town.' It was like, 'Nope, we’re here for the duration,'"" Gabbard told Manchester ABC affiliate WMUR.

During this week's storm, Gabbard posted pictures showing her doing yoga in her newly rented New Hampshire home as 2 feet of snow piled up outside.

She said she isn’t giving up on the other early voting states, saying she will be in South Carolina ""in a couple of weeks. But we look forward to spending a lot of time [in New Hampshire].""Rain, snow or sun ... it’s always a good time for #yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️ #TuesdayVibes pic.twitter.com/2QIOPAFmm4
Snow isn’t a foreign entity to Gabbard, despite growing up in Hawaii. She has spent several years on the mainland in Washington -- both as a congresswoman and a congressional staffer for the late Sen. Daniel Akaka -- and just this week braved the 20-degree weather marching in a holiday parade in Laconia, New Hampshire.

She did joke that Christmas this year will be a little different; ""I grew up in Hawaii where Christmas was you know 80 degrees and a day at the beach. And so being here for the winter, you know, the first snow of the year is always fun.""
Gabbard will likely spend the holiday season campaigning. New Hampshire is a unique state where 78% of likely primary voters said they are still trying to decide what candidate to support, or are leaning toward someone, but have not yet definitely decided on a candidate, according to the CNN/UNH poll.

Marty Prichard, an undecided voter in the state, said he's looking for a candidate who brings ""youth, new ideas and new concepts.""

""We're at a point in this country where things are very partisan within party lines,"" Prichard told ABC News after an event featuring South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Prichard said he’s looking for a candidate who can bridge that divide and only two candidates fit that bill: Buttgieg and Gabbard.
At a crowded town hall at Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire, in October, Gabbard acknowledged she had an uphill battle getting her name out there to voters. While 5% is enough to get her into debates, she remains well behind the favorites, even specifically in New Hampshire. Sen. Bernie Sanders, from neighboring Vermont, led in the October CNN/UNH poll with 21%, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from bordering Massachusetts, at 18%, former Vice President Joe Biden at 15%, Buttigieg at 10% and both Andrew Yang and Sen. Amy Klobuchar also at 5%.

""I don't have the same kind of high level of name recognition as somebody like Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, or others,"" she admitted.
In an attempt to fix the problem she has blanketed the state with billboards over the past year and said she’s received a good return on investment.

""We have folks coming to our town hall meetings, saying, 'Hey, I saw this yard sign,' or 'I saw this billboard and I thought, 'Huh I wonder who that is? And then I forgot about it. Then I saw another one, and another one, and another one and another one,'” Gabbard relayed.

While Gabbard is doubling down on New Hampshire, she's not the only one. Yang opened a campaign office in Manchester on Tuesday, marking his 75th event in the state. Buttigieg is beginning his 14th trip to the state on Thursday.

Rep. Duncan Hunter pleads guilty to conspiracy to misuse campaign funds,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-duncan-hunter-pleads-guilty-misusing-campaign-funds/story?id=67465874,"
California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of conspiracy in a case surrounding his alleged misuse of $250,000 in campaign donations for personal expenses such as family vacations and oral surgeries.

He once called the investigation a politically-motivated ""witch hunt.""

Hunter, 42, succeeded his father in representing the state's 50th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Diego and Riverside County, in 2008. The younger Hunter narrowly won his re-election race in 2018 after being indicted, along with his wife, Margaret on dozens of charges of improperly using campaign funds.
Hunter also allegedly tapped into some of that money to also finance romantic trysts with multiple congressional aides and lobbyists, according to federal prosecutors in new court filings.
Hunter told KUSI in an interview that aired on Monday he decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children.

“I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons, and those three reason are my kids,” Hunter said. “I think it’d be really tough for them, it’s hard enough being the kids of a public figure, and I think it’s time for them to live life outside the spotlight.”

A district spokesman for the congressman said that Hunter will discuss ""next steps with Republican leadership in DC.""

Hunter, during the KUSI interview, stressed what he sees as the importance of keeping the congressional seat red.

Hunter won with nearly 52 percent of the vote in 2018, narrowly beating out Democratic newcomer Ammar Campa-Najjar by three points. A string of controversial attack advertisements against Campa-Najjar also grabbed the national spotlight. One ad called called him a “security risk” because of his Palestinian family connections.

“Today is a sad day for this district because no constituent hopes to see their congressman plead guilty to corruption. But today is also a day filled with opportunity because it’s the first time in years people, not political scandals, will come first again,” Campa-Najjar said in a statement.
Hunter’s two main Republican opponents, former California Rep. Darrell Issa and radio host and former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio also praised Hunter’s decision to resign.

“Though his misuse of campaign funds was clearly wrong, I wish him and his family the best as they address the matters ahead of them,” Issa, the former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a statement Monday.

Hunter is due to be sentenced in March. His wife, Margaret, who was also charged in the case and pleaded guilty on a single corruption count, is slated to be sentenced in April.
Hunter's move opens up the possibility of another special election in California, in addition to the one set to take place in the state’s 25th Congressional District, where Democrat Rep. Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid multiple scandals.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on its GOP counterpart to return the $220,000 in contributions Hunter donated to the National Republican Congressional Committee.
""We know House Republicans are strapped for cash. But they've hit a new low by pocketing dollars from a Congressman who just pled guilty to federal corruption charges. If Minority Leader McCarthy and his campaign-arm choose to keep Hunter's checks, Hunter won't be the only Washington Republican misusing campaign funds,"" DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.

The seat has been represented by either Hunter or his father since 1980. The district, one of the last Republican areas remaining in southern California, could now be more vulnerable to a Democratic takeover.

Hunter was the second House member to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. He now joins another early Trump supporter, former Rep. Chris Collins of New York, in pleading guilty to criminal charges, after claiming his prosecution was politically motivated.

“I did make mistakes,” Hunter told KUSI “I justify that plea with the understanding that I am responsible for my campaign and what happens to my campaign money. Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit. My only hope is the judge does not sentence my wife to jail, I think my kids need a mom in the home.”

US Marine arrested on charges of smuggling undocumented immigrants across border,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-marine-arrested-charges-smuggling-undocumented-immigrants-southern/story?id=67471625,"
A U.S. Marine was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Monday on charges of smuggling undocumented immigrants across the southern border outside of San Diego, according to the Marine Corps.

""On December 2, 2019 at approximately 1:30 a.m., a junior-enlisted Marine with Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel for allegedly bringing in undocumented immigrants at the San Ysidro port of entry,"" the Marine Corps said in a statement. ""The Marine is currently being held in civilian custody. The determination as to the adjudicating authority has not yet been made.""
The Marine Corps said that the Marine arrested on Monday had not served as part of the Trump administration's southwest border support mission. CBP and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) are currently investigating the incident, according to the Marine Corps.

The San Ysidro port of entry is the busiest land border crossing in the western hemisphere, processing an average of 70,000 northbound vehicle passengers and 20,000 northbound pedestrians per day.
The arrest follows the detention of 23 Marines also from 1st Marine Division who were detained in July for human trafficking, drug distribution, and weapons charges. Of those, six have pleaded guilty to charges at courts-martial, according to the service.

""Thirteen Marines submitted and have approved pre-trial agreements requesting separation in lieu of courts-martial or waiving administrative separation boards,"" the Marine Corps told ABC News in a statement.""The remaining four Marines are currently in the process of being adjudicated.""

The Marines charged with human trafficking this past summer were alleged to have moved undocumented immigrants from locations within the U.S., not across the border."
Former Secretary of State Kerry endorses former VP Biden for president,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secretary-state-john-kerry-endorses-vp-joe-biden/story?id=67520971,"
Former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry announced Thursday that he is endorsing Joe Biden for president, providing a high-profile boost for the former vice president with just under two months to go until the first primary votes are cast.

The endorsement comes as Biden continues his eight-day, 18 county “No Malarkey” bus tour through Iowa, which Kerry is set to join on Friday morning.

“I believe Joe Biden is the President our country desperately needs right now, not because I’ve known Joe so long, but because I know Joe so well. I’ve never before seen the world more in need of someone who on day one can begin the incredibly hard work of putting back together the world Donald Trump has smashed apart,” Kerry wrote in a statement released Thursday by the Biden campaign.
Kerry, the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer during the 2004 presidential election, faced an uncertain path to the nomination not dissimilar to the one Biden now faces, and was, like Biden, lagging in the polls in Iowa in the final stretch to caucus day.

Biden referenced Kerry's comeback in the Iowa caucuses on Wednesday while campaigning at Iowa State University in Ames.

""I remember at this time John Kerry was getting his rear end kicked. He was, I think, number four. And he came back and he won,"" Biden said.

""We had planned all along after Thanksgiving, we were going to be on the ground a lot more, going to smaller communities and to make sure we were pressing the flesh and asking.”
Biden is neck and neck in the polls with three other top Democratic contenders for the party's presidential nomination: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders

In a tweet highlighting his endorsement, Kerry underscored that his support of Biden is because he knows him well and feels ""he'll be ready on day one to put back together the country and the world that Donald Trump has broken apart.""Proud to head back to Iowa tomorrow to campaign with my friend Joe. I’m not endorsing Joe because I’ve known him for so long, but because I know him so well: he'll be ready on day one to put back together the country and the world that Donald Trump has broken apart.— John Kerry (@JohnKerry) December 5, 2019

Proud to head back to Iowa tomorrow to campaign with my friend Joe. I’m not endorsing Joe because I’ve known him for so long, but because I know him so well: he'll be ready on day one to put back together the country and the world that Donald Trump has broken apart.
Kerry's criticism of Trump came on the heels of a video released by the Biden campaign shortly after President Trump touched down on U.S. soil following the NATO summit.

The video features Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson all appearing to laugh on camera in reference to Trump.

""A President the world is laughing at,"" reads a text slate in the video.

Biden also talked about Trump being mocked on the world stage at nearly every one of his campaign events in Iowa on Wednesday.

Trump doesn't know why Giuliani spoke with OMB,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-giuliani-spoke-omb-67489490,"
President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed the significance of repeated contacts between his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and phone numbers linked to the White House and its budget office — contacts that were first revealed in a House Intelligence Committee impeachment report released earlier this week.
""So somebody said he made a phone call into the White House. What difference does that make?” Trump said to reporters during a meeting with Italy's prime minister on the sidelines of a NATO meeting outside of London.
“Is that supposed to be a big deal?'"" he added. ""I don’t think so.""
The 300-page report laying out the case against Trump is serving as the basis for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry:         House Judiciary Committee hearings that are expected to precede the drafting of formal articles of impeachment against him. On Wednesday, the committee heard from law professors who discussed the constitutional origins of Congress’ impeachment power and debated whether Trump committed an impeachable offense when he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate a Democratic political rival and potentially held up critical security aid to pressure him.
The report, which was made public Tuesday, includes a summary of phone records obtained by the committee showing extensive contact between Giuliani and the White House, as well as a caller identified only as “-1.”
On April 24, for instance, Giuliani spoke three times with a number linked to the Office of Management and Budget — the office that delayed the release of hundreds of millions in earmarked Ukrainian aid money — and he spoke eight times with a number linked to the White House, the documents show.
Later that night, the State Department phoned then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and abruptly called her home from Kyiv because of “concerns” from “up the street” at the White House.
The release of the phone logs in the report sparked search efforts at the White House and in the budget office to try to track down who had been in touch with Giuliani, to no apparent avail.
OMB officials told The Associated Press that a staff review showed that nobody there has ever spoken to Giuliani. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney still uses the cellphone he had when he ran the budget office, leading some to suspect that he may be the holder of the “OMB Phone Number.” But a senior White House official said a review of his cellphone records did not turn up any calls between Mulvaney and Giuliani on the days cited in the report. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal records.
Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday insisted he knew nothing about the calls, even as he maintained they were “no big deal.” He also defended Giuliani as a “very good lawyer,” a “great crime fighter” and “the best mayor in the history of New York City.”
“Rudy is a great gentleman and they’re after him only because he’s done such a good job. He was very effective against Mueller and the Mueller hoax,” Trump said, referring to former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Giuliani, too, weighed in by tweet.
“The mere fact I had numerous calls with the White House does not establish any specific topic,"" he wrote, adding: “Remember, I’m the President’s attorney.” The White House has a full legal office that handles official matters.
Giuliani has long pushed the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election and is accused of trying to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump’s potential Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, when his father worked at the White House.
The phone records released Tuesday also raised new questions about the role of California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes, the records show, had a series of calls with Giuliani, as well as with Giuliani's now-indicted associate Lev Parnas. One conversation with Parnas on April 12 lasted eight minutes, according to call logs. 
Nunes told Fox News host Sean Hannity that “it's possible” he talked to Parnas, but claimed he wasn't sure because he hadn't gone through all his phone records.
“I don't really recall that name. I remember the name now because he has been indicted,’’ Nunes said, adding that any conversation with Parnas would have been appropriate. 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., meanwhile, defended Nunes on Wednesday, saying that, “Devin can talk to anybody he wants to talk to.”
Asked if Nunes should have told House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff about his conversations with people under investigation, McCarthy instead criticized Schiff for his office's communication with the whistle blower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.

GOP Rep. Hunter pleads guilty,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-duncan-hunter-pleads-guilty-misusing-campaign-funds/story?id=67465874,"
California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of conspiracy in a case surrounding his alleged misuse of $250,000 in campaign donations for personal expenses such as family vacations and oral surgeries.

He once called the investigation a politically-motivated ""witch hunt.""

Hunter, 42, succeeded his father in representing the state's 50th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Diego and Riverside County, in 2008. The younger Hunter narrowly won his re-election race in 2018 after being indicted, along with his wife, Margaret on dozens of charges of improperly using campaign funds.
Hunter also allegedly tapped into some of that money to also finance romantic trysts with multiple congressional aides and lobbyists, according to federal prosecutors in new court filings.
Hunter told KUSI in an interview that aired on Monday he decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children.

“I think it’s important not to have a public trial for three reasons, and those three reason are my kids,” Hunter said. “I think it’d be really tough for them, it’s hard enough being the kids of a public figure, and I think it’s time for them to live life outside the spotlight.”

A district spokesman for the congressman said that Hunter will discuss ""next steps with Republican leadership in DC.""

Hunter, during the KUSI interview, stressed what he sees as the importance of keeping the congressional seat red.

Hunter won with nearly 52 percent of the vote in 2018, narrowly beating out Democratic newcomer Ammar Campa-Najjar by three points. A string of controversial attack advertisements against Campa-Najjar also grabbed the national spotlight. One ad called called him a “security risk” because of his Palestinian family connections.

“Today is a sad day for this district because no constituent hopes to see their congressman plead guilty to corruption. But today is also a day filled with opportunity because it’s the first time in years people, not political scandals, will come first again,” Campa-Najjar said in a statement.
Hunter’s two main Republican opponents, former California Rep. Darrell Issa and radio host and former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio also praised Hunter’s decision to resign.

“Though his misuse of campaign funds was clearly wrong, I wish him and his family the best as they address the matters ahead of them,” Issa, the former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a statement Monday.

Hunter is due to be sentenced in March. His wife, Margaret, who was also charged in the case and pleaded guilty on a single corruption count, is slated to be sentenced in April.
Hunter's move opens up the possibility of another special election in California, in addition to the one set to take place in the state’s 25th Congressional District, where Democrat Rep. Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid multiple scandals.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on its GOP counterpart to return the $220,000 in contributions Hunter donated to the National Republican Congressional Committee.
""We know House Republicans are strapped for cash. But they've hit a new low by pocketing dollars from a Congressman who just pled guilty to federal corruption charges. If Minority Leader McCarthy and his campaign-arm choose to keep Hunter's checks, Hunter won't be the only Washington Republican misusing campaign funds,"" DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.

The seat has been represented by either Hunter or his father since 1980. The district, one of the last Republican areas remaining in southern California, could now be more vulnerable to a Democratic takeover.

Hunter was the second House member to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. He now joins another early Trump supporter, former Rep. Chris Collins of New York, in pleading guilty to criminal charges, after claiming his prosecution was politically motivated.

“I did make mistakes,” Hunter told KUSI “I justify that plea with the understanding that I am responsible for my campaign and what happens to my campaign money. Whatever my time in custody is, I will take that hit. My only hope is the judge does not sentence my wife to jail, I think my kids need a mom in the home.”

Warren takes aim at Buttigieg and Biden in pointed speech,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warren-takes-aim-buttigieg-biden-pitches-democrat-corruption/story?id=67694289,"
Sen. Elizabeth Warren launched a handful of pointed critiques at her moderate Democratic primary opponents on Thursday, using an economic policy speech at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire to pitch herself as the sole candidate in the race who will attack corruption head on and describing opponents former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as beholden to high-dollar donors.

""We're nearly a year into the Democratic primary and no other candidate has put out anything close to my sweeping plan to root out Washington corruption. Now, some candidates have at least put forward campaign finance reform plans, but if you want to know about a candidate's commitment to reform, don't just look at what they say they will do -- look at what they're doing right now,"" Warren said.

""Most candidates haven't disclosed the names of their bundlers or finance committees. They are spending time in fundraisers with high-dollar donors, selling access to their time for money. Some of them have spent months blocking reporters from entering those fancy, closed-door affairs. We know that one Democratic candidate walked into a room of wealthy donors this year to promise that 'nothing would fundamentally change' if he's elected president,"" Warren added, referring to both Buttigieg and Biden, respectively.
Warren's criticism comes on the heels of a weeks-long feud over transparency with Buttigieg, which led both candidates to release more information about their time working for big companies: Buttigieg for McKinsey and Co. and Warren as a bankruptcy lawyer for companies like Dow Chemical and Travelers Insurance.

Buttigieg has also recently decided to open his fundraisers to the press and pledged to release the names of his bundlers -- a political term for people who pull together fundraising money from different donors for the campaigns -- as well as who serves on his financial committee, all after calls last week from Warren to show ""what promises he's making to rich folks and what he's saying that's different from what he says when he's out on the trail.""

Buttigieg hasn't released a list of bundlers since April.

As for Biden, Warren's criticism referred to comments the front-runner made earlier this year to donors, expressing that he didn't think wealthy people should be demonized and assuring the room that ""nothing would fundamentally change"" if he was elected.

In her speech, Warren contrasted Biden and Buttigieg's high-dollar fundraisers with her own campaign, which she has pledged to run without doing any closed-door fundraisers.
""Look, I don't ask for a thousand dollar contribution in exchange for a picture. I'm closing in on 100,000 selfies for a grand total of zero dollars,"" Warren said. Warren, who promises voters at most town halls that she'll stay to take photos with whoever wants one, took her 90,000th photo at a rally in Chicago after Thanksgiving.

Though the Thursday speech was chock-full of wealth disparity statistics and the dozens of plans Warren has proposed to address economic issues facing families, most notable were the dozens of critiques she launched at her fellow Democratic candidates -- part of a growing trend for Warren, who largely refused to ""bash"" other Democrats in earlier stages of the primary.

Asked if the intent of her speech was to argue that she was the only Democrat in the race who could fix the problems facing America, Warren said, ""pretty much.""
""I mean, look we know how bad the problems are right now, no one is proposing the kinds of solutions that address those problems. We have a serious problem in America with corruption, with a Washington that keeps working better and better and better for those at the top and not much for anyone else,"" she told reporters after the speech. ""But Americans know this all across the country and it means in a Democratic primary, that's a problem we should be wrestling with, it's one we should be attacking head on -- and it's just not happening.""

While Warren never mentioned Biden or Buttigieg by name, she was clear in her words on Thursday, quoting Biden and listing specific examples from Buttigieg's campaign more than once.

""Now, unlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I am not counting on Republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability that they've opposed under Democratic presidents for a generation,"" Warren said in the speech, drawing on comments Biden made in May about working across the aisle with Republicans.

""The thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,"" Biden told reporters at the time. ""You will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.""
Warren, on the other hand, has argued that Democrats will not win by campaigning on a return to the era before Trump, but rather that they should fight for ""big, structural change.""

""Unlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if Democrats adopt Republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well-connected will stand down,"" Warren said in her speech Thursday.

Her comments about ""progressive policies"" and ""Republican critiques"" referred to criticism from both Biden and Buttigieg after she released details on her vision of Medicare for All plan back in November.
While Biden and Buttigieg, who support a public option for health care but do not support getting rid of private insurance companies, argued that the math behind her plan didn't add up and that Medicare for All would be too disruptive, Warren said their arguments against her plan were recycled talking points often heard on the Republican side.

In response to Warren's speech on Thursday, senior communications adviser for Buttigieg, Lis Smith, said Warren's ""idea of how to defeat Donald Trump is to tell people who don't support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party.""

""We need to move beyond the politics and divisiveness that is tearing this country apart and holding us back. Pete will be a President who will heal our divides and rally Americans around big ideas to solve the problems that have festered in Washington for too long,"" Smith said in a statement.
The Biden campaign declined to comment to ABC News, though the candidate did make an apparent reference to the Warren speech at a fundraiser late Thursday.

""I read a speech by one of my -- good person -- one of my opponents, saying that, 'You know, Biden says we’re going to have to work with Republicans to get stuff passed,’” Biden said to chuckles from the audience in Palo Alto, California. “I thought, ‘Well, OK -- how are you going to do it, by executive order?’”

The three Democrats will meet face-to-face on the debate stage next Thursday in Los Angeles for the sixth Democratic debate.

The Note: Early 2020 exits showcase Democrats’ uncertainties,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-early-2020-exits-showcase-democrats-uncertainties/story?id=67467825,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

The just-right candidates are proving to be just wrong for the moment.

The governors who cast themselves as across-the-aisle dealmakers are gone. So is one of the stars of the midterm cycle who was seen as a source of blue inspiration from a deep-red state.
Now Sen. Kamala Harris joins them in making an early exit from the 2020 contest. She’s the second female senator to fizzle. Hype and diversity are among the surprise casualties with two months left before Iowa.

Yet, for all the big-name busts, Democrats appear to be no closer to uniting around what they want in a candidate. Even the dividing lines -- generational, ideological, racial, geographical -- remain in doubt.

President Donald Trump is closer than ever to impeachment, with the House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing on Wednesday. Yet even this week, the leading Democratic candidates are elevating their squabbles with each other.

High-profile exits have created some new space in the race. But it’s not at all clear who will fill it -- or how.

The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks

One of the big red flags for her candidacy, was the way Harris' team never seemed confident in her ability to win her home state.

While, she enjoyed several endorsements, many of the high-profile ones alluded her. With the last debate of the year set in Los Angeles later this month, there is about to be more serious and public conversation among Democrats about who might really be in position to win the hundreds of delegates up for grabs there.

And it is possible that Democrats gave self-funders a huge gift by moving the state up so early this year.

Campaigns for Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are boasting about big teams out West, but will that ground game matter?

For years the state was seen as just too big to win over in a traditional way. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on the other hand can buy ads there now, when so many other candidates can’t -- or at least wanted to wait to see how they did in the first few states.

The TIP with Adam Kelsey

One of the immediate effects of Harris' decision to suspend her campaign is its impact on the December debate stage, which, as of Wednesday morning, now features just six candidates -- all of whom are white.

Though Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang have all reached the donor threshold necessary to qualify, that group is still waiting on four, one and one qualifying polls of at least 4%, respectively, to prevent a racially homogeneous matchup. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and former Gov. Deval Patrick are in even more dire straits, having reached neither the poll numbers nor the donors. Castro sent a fundraising email to this point on Tuesday decrying the prospect of ""not having someone in this race who will speak to the issues and experiences that are too often ignored.""
Booker, who called Harris' exit ""a damn shame"" in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday after noting that the Democrats initially had the most diverse field ever, inherits the designation of the top-polling African American candidate. But he has shared his campaign's money struggles and has admitted that missing out on the debate stage could present more financial issues given that some of his strongest fundraising days this year have followed well-received debate performances.

That said, it may be premature to begin writing another candidate obituary. At last month's debate in Atlanta, Booker staffers assured ABC News that whether they punched a ticket to Los Angeles or not, the New Jersey senator would be seeing his campaign through to the Iowa caucuses. He also said on Tuesday that he'll be ""doubling-down"" his efforts to ""excite and ignite"" the coalition of voters who delivered victory to former President Barack Obama. On Thursday, he kicks off a four-day, 11-county tour of the Hawkeye State.

White House won't participate in any House impeachment proceedings: Official,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-participate-house-impeachment-proceedings-source/story?id=67551511,"
The White House sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler Friday afternoon blasting the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, and while it doesn't say explicitly that President Donald Trump and his lawyers will not participate in their upcoming proceedings, a senior White House official told ABC News the point of the letter is that they won't take part.

""House Democrats have wasted enough of America's time with this charade,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote. ""You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings.""

""Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats, and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan, and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our Nation's history,"" he said.

""We don't see any reason to participate because the process is unfair. Speaker Pelosi had already announced the predetermined result. They will not give us the ability to call any witnesses,"" a senior administration official told ABC News.   PACLetter2019.06.12 by Anonymous TjVFb1a9 on Scribd
In a letter last week, Nadler asked the president to notify the committee by Friday at 5 p.m. whether his lawyers would participate in any of their proceedings and whether they plan to present a defense. The Judiciary Committee announced a hearing on Monday in which lawyers for the Democrats and Republicans from the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committee's will present findings from the investigations.
The absence of White House participation follows weeks of vocal protests from the president and Republicans in Congress, who have accused Democrats of blocking their due process rights. In a previous letter to Nadler, the White House argued it could not be expected to participate in the hearing with constitutional scholars because the committee provided them little information about it. The White House said it would consider participating in upcoming proceedings if the committee conducted a ""fair process going forward.""

However, the White House is preparing an aggressive defense of the president for a Senate trial if and when the House sends over articles of impeachment.
""The underlying impeachment rules of the Senate afford the president a full suite of rights to argue his case on the facts and on the merits,"" Eric Ueland, legislative affairs director for the White House, told reporters. ""That's why we believe quite strongly that in order to make the president's whole case, in contradiction to a partisan process which doesn't allow him to make his full case, that we need both a full trial and the opportunity to call witnesses and work a trial over here on the Senate floor.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday she had instructed House Democrats to draw up articles of impeachment of Trump, saying he'd abused his power.

""Sadly, but with confidence and humility ... today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,"" she said. ""The facts are uncontested. The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security by withholding military aid and a crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into his political rival.""
Articles of impeachment could be drafted and introduced next week. That will set up a public committee hearing to mark up and approve the articles, sending them to the House floor. That could happen as early as the week after the Monday hearing.

Democrats are still on track to vote and pass articles of impeachment out of the House the week before Christmas. "
How the impeachment process works,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-process-works/story?id=51202880,"
Impeachment proceedings for Donald Trump are rolling full steam ahead, with Democrats holding public hearings again this week and moving toward drafting articles of impeachment.

While the process has long been discussed for Trump, Democrats’ efforts have gained traction in recent weeks following a whistleblower complaint about a controversial call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was revealed that critics say includes a quid pro quo for political gain.

Since taking control of the House in 2018, Democratic leadership has been wary to broach the subject of impeachment, even after the Mueller report was issued, which did not clear the president of obstruction of justice. But the Ukraine call and its fallout have changed that calculus.

Trump has called the inquiry the continuation of a “witch hunt” that has dogged his presidency and Republicans members of Congress have attacked the process as a sham that disregards the president’s due process rights and impedes his ability to conduct foreign policy.

But what is the impeachment process and what does it mean for Trump and the country?
An impeachment proceeding is the formal process by which a sitting president of the United States may be accused of wrongdoing. It is a political process and not a criminal process.

The articles of impeachment are the list of charges drafted against the president. The vice president and all civil officers of the U.S. can also face impeachment.

The process begins in the House of Representatives, where any member may make a suggestion to launch an impeachment proceeding. It is then up to the speaker of the House, as leader of the majority party, to determine whether or not to proceed with an inquiry into the alleged wrongdoing.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formal opening of an impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, citing what she called Trump’s “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections"" and the full House voted on Oct. 31 to authorize the inquiry. 

In Trump’s case, the House Intelligence Committee was tasked with the investigation and the matter has been turned over to the Judiciary Committee, which could draw up articles of impeachment. But the process is dictated entirely by the ruling party.

A simple majority of the members of the committee would have to vote in favor of approving an article or articles of impeachment in order to proceed to a vote by the full House. The House Judiciary Committee currently consists of 24 Democrats and 17 Republicans; 21 votes in favor would be necessary.

Each article of impeachment that is passed by a simple majority vote in committee would then be voted on by the full House of Representatives. If any of those articles gets a simple majority vote, which is 50% plus one more vote (218), then the president would be impeached.

When it comes to impeachment, the Constitution lists ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,"" as justification for the proceedings, but the vagueness of the third option has caused problems in the past.

""It was a central issue with Andrew Johnson, and there was a question during Clinton's proceedings about whether his lie was a ‘low’ crime or a ‘high’ crime,"" Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina who authored a book on the impeachment process, told ABC News.
According to Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in constitutional law, ""nobody knows"" what is specifically included or not included in the Constitution’s broad definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

""It’s only happened twice and so the general thought is that it means whatever the House and the Senate think it means,"" Sherry said, and even if the House approves the article or articles of impeachment, the senators can choose to vote against the articles if they feel they are not appropriate.

A president can continue governing even after he or she has been impeached by the House of Representatives. After Clinton was impeached on Dec. 19, 1998,he finished out his second term, which ended in January 2001, during which time he was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. While Clinton continued governing, and the impeachment had no legal or official impact, his legacy is marred by the proceeding.

The Senate is tasked with handling the impeachment trial, which is presided over by the chief justice of the United States. To remove a president from office, two-thirds of the members must vote in favor – at present 67.

If the Senate fails to convict, a president is considered impeached but is not removed, as was the case with both Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. In Johnson’s case, the Senate fell one vote short of removing him from office on all three counts.

While the Senate trial has the power to oust a president from office, and ban him or her from running for future office, it does not have the power to send a president to jail. Disqualification from holding office, a separate process, requires a simple majority vote, according to the Congressional Research Service.

""The worst that can happen is that he is removed from office, that's the sole punishment,"" Sherry said.

That said, a president can face later criminal charges. Sherry points out that in the Constitution ""the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.""

While presidential removal is unprecedented, the vice president would assume office under the 25th Amendment, which was ratified in 1967. Then the new president would nominate a new vice president who would have to be confirmed by a majority of both houses of Congress.

Only Clinton and Johnson have been impeached and no U.S. president has ever been forced out of office.

Johnson faced impeachment in 1868 after clashing with the Republican-led House over the “rights of those who had been freed from slavery,” although firing his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who was backed by the Republicans, led to the impeachment effort. The articles of impeachment centered on the Stanton event, according to the Senate.

Clinton, whose impeachment was connected to the cover-up of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky while in office, was 22 votes away from reaching the necessary number of votes in the Senate.

Richard Nixon faced three articles of impeachment related to the Watergate scandal, in which he allegedly obstructed the investigation and helped cover up the crimes surrounding the break-in.
Nixon faced articles of impeachment, meaning that the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in relation to the Watergate scandal, but didn’t let the process get any further.

But he didn’t let the process get any further,  resigning before the House could impeach him.

Trump administration releases Lebanon military aid after it was held up for months,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-releases-lebanon-military-aid-held-months/story?id=67451332,"
The Trump administration has released $105 million in military aid to Lebanon, a senior administration official said Monday night, after the assistance had been held up for months with no explanation.

The delay in delivering the security assistance to Lebanon's armed forces had prompted urgent questions from Lebanon's government and from Congress, with one Democratic senator likening it to the hold-up of aid to Ukraine that sparked an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. There has been no allegation that Trump stood to benefit from his administration holding up aid to Lebanon, though.

While the U.S. government provided no explanation for the holdup, there had been speculation that the delay may have been related to Hezbollah's powerful role in the Lebanese government.
The senior administration official said that Trump and his administration ""take our obligation to the American taxpayers very seriously.""
The administration, the official said, ""continually reviews and thoroughly evaluates the effectiveness of all United States foreign assistance to ensure that funds go toward activities that further U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, and do not directly or indirectly benefit our adversaries.""

Since at least June, the White House and its Office of Management and Budget had blocked the security assistance, passed by Congress and signed by the president, from reaching the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), including military vehicles, weapons and ammunition.
The LAF is the country's multi-sectarian military that enjoys strong national popularity and is a key U.S. partner in the country.

There will be no change in the level of foreign military financing provided to the LAF from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019, the official said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week declined to answer questions on the aid during a press briefing, but the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East told reporters that the hold was ""still working its way through the bureaucratic process.""

""There's a review, and it's ongoing,"" David Schenker, the assistant secretary for near eastern affairs, said. He then added that he expected a resolution ""very, very shortly,"" but couldn’t say when.
Schenker declined to discuss any reasons for the review, calling the deliberations ""classified"" and ""internal.""

But David Hale, the under secretary for political affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee a week earlier that even he had not heard any explanation from the White House or OMB on why the aid was being withheld.

In a closed-door deposition on Nov. 6, Hale told lawmakers that there was ""a dispute over the efficacy of the assistance,"" but his full response was redacted from a released transcript."
What to watch for at Wednesday's impeachment hearing,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/watch-wednesdays-impeachment-hearing/story?id=67449058,"
Some of President Donald Trump’s fiercest critics and defenders on Capitol Hill return to the spotlight Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds its first hearing in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.
On Wednesday morning, the panel will hear testimony from constitutional scholars just hours after the House Intelligence Committee released its report Tuesday evening into whether Trump improperly ordered military aid to Ukraine withheld to pressure the country to launch investigations against a potential 2020 political rival.

Led by Democrat Jerry Nadler of New York, the committee is also responsible for drafting and approving any articles of impeachment against Trump, which some Democrats have suggested could include charges focused on bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress.
The House Judiciary Committee is much more contentious

Unlike the House Intelligence Committee, a historically buttoned-up panel that has traditionally conducted its oversight of the intelligence community quietly and in a bipartisan fashion, the 41-member Judiciary Committee is one of the oldest and largest in the House, and tends to attract sharp-elbowed lawyers, former prosecutors and passionate advocates because of its sprawling jurisdiction over the justice system, immigration, federal and criminal law.
A mix of party leaders, junior lawmakers, and partisans from both sides of the aisle, the Judiciary Committee also includes some of the most prominent defenders and critics of the president on Capitol Hill.

Members to watch


Trump confidants such as Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led a Republican protest in the closed-door SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and disrupted the Intelligence Committee’s work in October, and Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, who has accused Democrats of waging a “coup” against the president, are both members of the committee, and will take part in questioning of any witnesses moving forward.
For the majority, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a constitutional law professor-turned-Trump critic who has helped craft the party’s messaging on impeachment, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democratic caucus and potential successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are among the Democrats to watch.

The Judiciary Committee also includes veterans of past impeachment efforts, including GOP Reps. Steve Chabot of Ohio and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who were House mangers in the Senate trial in President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who was a committee staffer during Watergate.
Four members of the committee will be familiar faces to viewers of the Intelligence Committee’s hearings: Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Val Demmings of Florida, along with Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas who serve on both panels.

Democrats plan keep the hearing focused on the details of the Ukraine impeachment investigation, and whether they meet the constitutional threshold of bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.
Nadler under pressure to wield a sharp gavel like Schiff and keep Republicans at bay

After Schiff led two weeks of tightly-controlled hearings, many hope Nadler will be able to keep the hearing on track, and prevent the session from resembling the combative hearing with Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, earlier this year, before the Ukraine matter exploded into public view.

Republicans, for their part, have accused Democrats of running an investigation that has denied Trump due process and the ability to question fact witnesses to events at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Using parliamentary inquiries and points of order, they could seek to fluster Democrats and air their concerns about the proceedings.

The White House has rejected Democrats’ offer to participate in Wednesday’s hearing, but has not ruled out taking part in subsequent hearings.
“We're back, by the way, in rerun season here in the Judiciary Committee. We've already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the Mueller report and others,” Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday” this past weekend, referring to the committee’s earlier hearings on the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller.

“This is a complete American waste of time,” Collins said, foreshadowing the kind of attacks he and other republicans can be expected to stage when the hearing gets underway.

Schiff, meanwhile, says his committee will not let up.

“Even while Judiciary does its work, we will continue investigating.” he said on MSNBC Monday night.

He did not tip his hand on the timing of any impeachment vote, but said Democrats believe the matter has some “urgency.”

“This is a threat to the integrity of the upcoming election, and we don’t feel that it should wait.”

He also said he believes the evidence of obstruction of Congress is “overwhelming.”

What are the witnesses expected to say?

The Judiciary Committee will hear from three constitutional experts called by Democrats and one by Republicans.

The GOP’s witness, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, recently wrote in The Hill:

“House Democrats have done a masterful job of holding hearings with testimony from distinguished diplomatic and national security witnesses on the alleged quid pro quo that President Trump sought from Ukraine. The problem is that the record is incomplete and conflicted on critical points. The question is whether Democrats want a real or a recreational impeachment. A real impeachment case can be made, but to make it, they will have to reschedule, reframe, and repeat their House investigation. As compelling and upsetting as much of the testimony has been, the record still lacks direct evidence of a quid pro quo on American military aid to Ukraine,"" Turley wrote.

Testifying for the Democrats, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, recently wrote in The New York Times: “To be sure, Donald Trump had already created a crisis in the presidency by abusing the power of his office to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But that act on its own didn’t count as a constitutional crisis, because the Constitution prescribes an answer to presidential abuse of office: impeachment.

“Now that President Trump has announced — via a letter signed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel — that he will not cooperate in any way with the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives, we no longer have just a crisis of the presidency. We also have a breakdown in the fundamental structure of government under the Constitution. That counts as a constitutional crisis,” Feldman said,

Another Democratic witness, Michael Gerhardt a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, wrote in The Atlantic:

“If you add up the nonsense that the president’s defenders have proliferated and his protestation that the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants, their proposed result is disturbing: an executive who can shut down an impeachment inquiry and protect from disclosure anything done by anyone in the executive branch, and who is immune to criminal investigation and allowed to defy subpoenas.

“This is not the president our Constitution established. He would be a king, in spite of the fact that the Founders’ generation rebelled against one. They set out to create a presidency that was accountable to Congress if the occupant abused power and breached the public’s trust. Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry destroy their vision,” Gerhardt wrote.

The third Democratic witness is Pamela Khan, a professor at Stanford Law School.

Trump tweets at Greta Thunberg to 'chill' following person of the year announcement,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tweets-greta-thunberg-chill-person-year-announcement/story?id=67682690,"
President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday telling Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, to ""chill.""

Trump, 73, wrote ""so ridiculous"" in response to a tweet from actress and producer Roma Downey congratulating Thunberg on being named Time magazine's 2019 person of the year.
""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend!"" the president continued. ""Chill Greta, Chill!""

Seemingly in response to his tweet, Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to read: ""A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.""So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend!

Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE
Later Thursday, a verified Twitter account managed by the Trump 2020 campaign tweeted a doctored cover of Time's 2019 Person of the Year cover -- with Trump's head photoshopped onto Thunberg's body.When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: ✅Booming Economy✅Record Job Creation✅Historic Tax Cuts✅#AmericaFirst Trade Deals✅ISIS Destroyed✅Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY— Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) December 12, 2019 When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: ✅Booming Economy✅Record Job Creation✅Historic Tax Cuts✅#AmericaFirst Trade Deals✅ISIS Destroyed✅Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY
Both tweets come one day after Time magazine's announcement of Thunberg as Person of the Year, which represents the person or group, idea or object, that ""most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse.""

Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said while making the announcement that Thunberg ""represents a broader generational shift in the culture that we're seeing from the campuses of Hong Kong to the protests in Chile to Parkland, Florida, where the students marched against gun violence, where young people are demanding change urgently.""

The president was a finalist for the title this year and has demonstrated a persistent interest in who gets the titled each year. He was selected as Person of the Year in 2016.
This is not the first time the president has gone after Thunberg on Twitter -- and not the first time she's acknowledged it on the platform.

""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Trump tweeted in September after Thunberg gave a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly criticizing world leaders for inaction on climate changeShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.

FAA chief tells lawmakers aircraft certification system 'is not broken',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/faa-chief-tells-lawmakers-aircraft-certification-system-broken/story?id=67653188,"
Administrator Stephen Dickson, head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is pushing back against the notion that the 737 Max crashes reveal that something is broken with the aircraft certification process.

Dickson's comments came during a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing on Wednesday, focused on whether there was proper oversight by the FAA -- the agency responsible for regulating civil aviation in the U.S. -- during the certification process for the 737 Max. It was the committees fifth hearing since launching an investigation in March 2019 into the Boeing 737 Max planes connected to two fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people.

""The system is not broken,"" Dickson told Ranking member Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., but he did concede there is room for improvement. ""With any process and I've said many times even in these last four months, all processes need to be improved.""
Under the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program mandated by Congress, some of the aircraft certification process was delegated to manufacturers like Boeing. Critics of the ODA program say that delegation created a conflict of interest. However, others defend the program, saying there has been sufficient FAA oversight from start to finish during the process.
The agency is ""not delegating anything to Boeing,"" Dickson reassured the committee.

The committee's chairman, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said he "" target=""_blank"">still believes the FAA “failed to do its job.""

""The FAA trusted, but did not appropriately verify key information and assumptions Boeing presented to the agency about the 737 Max,"" DeFazio said in his opening statement.

DeFazio, backed up by other lawmakers, said he is prepared to implement legislation to strengthen government oversight over jetliner certification.

""We can certainly mandate changes in the approval process and the oversight process by the FAA,"" DeFazio told David Kerley, ABC News' senior transportation correspondent, on Tuesday. ""We're already thinking of options of changes we might make.""
737 Max certification stretches to 2020

Hours before the hearing on Wednesday, Dickson crushed Boeing's hope of getting the 737 Max re-certified before the end of the year.
“If you just do the math, it’s going to extend into 2020,"" Dickson said in an interview with CNBC.

The FAA grounded the 737 Max jets on March 13, and the agency has complete control over when the troubled plane will take to the skies again.

""When the 737 Max returns to service, the safety issues will have been addressed and pilots will have all the training they need,"" Dickson told lawmakers. ""I'm not going to sign off on this airplane until I fly it myself.""

In both crashes, it appears the angle-of-attack sensor was sending incorrect data, misfiring the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, which pushed the plane's nose down repeatedly even as pilots fought to gain altitude.
House Democrats released a FAA risk report on Wednesday which showed the potential of more than 15 fatal crashes over the life of the Max fleet -- about 45 years -- if no change was made to MCAS.

The risk assessment was conducted after the first 737 Max crash near Jakarta, Indonesia. At the time there was already suspicion that the crash was related to MCAS, and the assessment was intended to establish a timeline for a MCAS fix.
Dickson admitted the report showed an unacceptable level of risk, but because the FAA had issued an Airworthiness Directive and the MCAS fix was already in the works, both the agency and Boeing determined the 737 Max fulfilled the requirements to continue flying after the first crash.

Five months later an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after takeoff in Addis Ababa. Initial reports show the pilots were able to disable the MCAS system, but it was too late for them to regain control of the aircraft.

One of the software fixes Boeing has completed on the 737 Max is a change to rely on two sensors, not just one, to activate the MCAS. A second software fix is related to the overall flight-control software system.

Boeing's safety culture under scrutiny

Edward Pierson, a Boeing retiree, testified alongside Dickson on Wednesday, on safety concerns he claims were ignored regarding the 737 Max production line.

He said he was worried about the demand for workers to quickly produce the planes which might have led to injuries and mistakes.

DeFazio said he believes Pierson's concerns paint a picture of a company that put profit over safety -- though they weren't related to the plane software connected to the two crashes.
The lawmaker told ABC News in October that the committee has received ""report after report about production pressures"" inside Boeing, as part of its investigation.

""I fear that profit took precedence and put pressure on the whole organization all the way down,"" DeFazio said at the time.
Boeing has been accused of withholding information from the FAA regarding MCAS, including internal messages that surfaced in October in which the chief technical pilot for the aircraft, Mark Forkner, told another pilot that the MCAS flight control system was “running rampant” in a simulator session.

The documents released two months ago by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee show Forkner told FAA officials that MCAS was safe after calling it ""egregious"" based on simulator tests, according to internal messages and emails.

In regards to areas like pilot training and manual recommendations, Forkner was the main point of contact between the administration and Boeing, an FAA official explained.
Boeing said in a statement that Forkner's comments ""reflected a reaction to a simulator program that was not functioning properly, and that was still undergoing testing.""
Lawmakers and regulators were troubled over the fact that they initially did not have access to these internal messages.

FAA said in a statement that when it became aware of the messages, the agency found them ""disturbing"" and said it was ""disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to [their] attention immediately upon its discovery.""

DeFazio sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, after the messages and emails were released, writing that the ""messages indicate that Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA, which is highly disturbing.""

“I would say deliberate concealment would be a criminal act,” DeFazio said in October, when Kerley asked him if he felt the concealment of information could lead to criminal charges for Boeing. “We can't say that it was deliberately concealed definitively at this point.""

California congressman to resign shortly after the holidays,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-duncan-hunter-resign-shortly-holidays/story?id=67555177,"
Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California will resign shortly after the holidays after pleading guilty earlier this week  to one count of conspiracy in a case surrounding his alleged misuse of $250,000 in campaign donations for personal expenses such as family vacations and oral surgeries.

“Shortly after the Holidays I will resign from Congress,"" he said in an email sent from his congressional office. "" It has been an honor to serve the people of California’s 50th District, and I greatly appreciate the trust they have put in me over these last 11 years.""
He once called the investigation a politically-motivated ""witch hunt.""

On Thursday, the House Ethics Committee sent a letter to Hunter asking him to cease participation in floor votes following his guilty plea, citing a House rule that advises members convicted of crimes for which, ""under federal law, you may receive a sentence of two or more years of imprisonment"" to ""refrain"" from voting.""

The letter cites that though the provision is not mandatory, ""If you violate the clear principles of this provision- that is, by voting in  the House- you risk subjecting yourself to action by this Committee, and by the House, in addition to other disciplinary action that may be initiated in connection with your... conviction,"" the letter reads.

Hunter was the second House Republican to endorse then-candidate Trump during the 2016 election. Trump's first House endorsement came from GOP New York Rep. Chris Collins, who resigned in September before pleading guilty to insider trading related charges.

Together, the two co-chaired Trump's House Leadership Committee in 2016, before Trump won the nomination.

He narrowly won re-election in 2018 after being indicted, along with his wife Margaret, on dozens of charges of improperly using campaign funds.
Hunter also allegedly tapped into some of that money to also finance romantic trysts with multiple congressional aides and lobbyists, according to federal prosecutors in court filings.
Hunter told KUSI in an interview that aired on Monday he decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children. Hunter is due to be sentenced in March. His wife, Margaret, who was also charged in the case and pleaded guilty on a single corruption count, is slated to be sentenced in April.

Hunter's move opens up the possibility of another special election in California, in addition to the one set to take place in the state’s 25th Congressional District, where Democrat Rep. Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid multiple scandals.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on its GOP counterpart to return the $220,000 in contributions Hunter donated to the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Parties offer stark contrasts as committee debates articles of impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-judiciary-committee-debate-articles-impeachment-trump/story?id=67660049,"
House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler gaveled in a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, kicking off the committee's marathon session to approve two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump for debate and approval, holding a ""markup"" -- a public meeting where members can debate and offer amendments to the charges -- ahead of a House floor vote next week.

""Taken together, these two articles charge President Trump, with placing his private, political interests above our national security, and above our free and fair elections, and above our ability to hold public officials accountable,"" Nadler said.

He ticked through the articles, and defended Democrats' timetable.

""Some ask, why not take more time?"" Nadler asked.

""One indisputable truth has emerged,"" he continued. ""If we do not respond to President Trump's abuses of power, they will continue.""
He also delivered a message to Republicans:

""I know you. I have worked with many of you for years. I consider you to be good and decent public servants. I know this moment may be difficult, but you still have a choice,"" he said.

""One way or the other, President Trump will not be president forever,"" he added. ""His time has passed, his grip on our politics is gone when our country returns as truly it will -- stronger ties, stronger leadership -- history will look back on our actions here today. How would you be remembered?""
Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., responded with a passionate and fiery opening statement repeating many of his past criticisms, before ticking through examples of what he called ""the big lie"" by the Democrats.

""What's the big lie? It’s the one Democrats have told the American people for the last three years,"" Collins said, defending Trump. ""The big lie is that the ends justify the means. The big lie is that a sham impeachment is OK because the threat is so great. The big lie is that political expedience is honorable and justifiable. History has shown that to be untrue and dangerous.""

Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, ticked through a list of fact-witnesses Republicans have requested to hear from, including the individual some Republicans have publicly alleged is the whistleblower who called attention to Trump's discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He also went as far as to call this ""a sad day for America.""
Another Democrat, Rep. Cedric Richmond, resurrected a famous 2016 line from the president that he could ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters"" to say that the president is ""shooting holes in our Constitution.""

Richmond looked across the dais at the Republicans and asked: ""If the tables were turned, do you think he would stand with you?""

Democrats generally defended the pace of their proceedings, warning that Trump continued to obstruct Congress and encouraged interference in the upcoming election.

Their urgency, some Democrats argued, was justified by his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's most recent trip to Ukraine last week.

""I did not call for impeachment before but I called for impeachment today, because this is one heck of an emergency,"" Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said. ""The facts are clear. President Trump undermined America's foreign policy to pursue what his own national security staff called it domestic political errand.""
Republicans largely hewed to criticizing Democrats' impeachment proceedings, slamming the articles they have drawn up against the president and accusing them of waging a politically motivated campaign against Trump that began when he took office.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., referred to the Democrats as ""sore losers.""

""President Trump's true crime in their eyes was win in 2016 election, against all odds and against the establishment of both parties,"" Gaetz said.

In one of the most emotional moments of the evening on the Democratic side, freshman Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., who ran for Congress as a gun control advocate after the shooting of her 17-year-old son in 2012, promised to ""vote my conscience"" and do so ""with a heavy heart and a grieving soul.""
McBath, unlike most of the Democrats on the committee, is from a deep red district -- and voting for impeachment could have ramifications for her in 2020.

""I believe the president abused the power of his office, in putting his own interests above the needs of our nation,"" she said.

""This is not why I came to Washington,"" she said. ""I came to Washington full of hope empowered by my community to serve in Congress.""

Nadler also acknowledged the absence Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who underwent a heart procedure at George Washington University Hospital and will miss the week's hearings. but said he would be watching ""a lot of TV.""

Each lawmaker on the 41-member committee will have the opportunity to make a five-minute opening statement before the committee reconvenes Thursday morning to continue debate and to make any changes to the wording.
It's unlikely that Democrats will approve any substantive changes to the articles before the expected party-line vote to send them to the full House Thursday ahead of final votes next week, setting the stage for a Senate trial beginning in January.

Nadler announced Tuesday that Democrats were going forward with charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Nadler, flanked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, said Trump had ""violated his oath to the American people.""
Schiff, whose committee led the impeachment probe with regard to Ukraine matters, said the evidence of Trump's misconduct is ""overwhelming and uncontested"" and said he left them no choice but to act.

""The president's continuing abuse of power has left us no choice,"" Schiff said Tuesday. ""To do noting would make ourselves complicit in the president's abuse of his high office, the public trust, and our national security.""

At a campaign rally Tuesday night in Hersey, Pennsylvania, Trump derided the the articles ""flimsy, pathetic"" and ""impeachment-lite"" saying they don't allege ""bribery"" or any other ""crimes.""

The Judiciary Committee adjourned at about 10:30 p.m and will pick back up on Thursday at 9 a.m.

Trump campaign runs misleading anti-impeachment Facebook ads,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-runs-misleading-anti-impeachment-facebook-ads/story?id=67553451,"
The Trump campaign is flooding Facebook with anti-impeachment ads that misleadingly imply House Democrats are pushing ""treason"" allegations against President Donald Trump in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.

The ads, which started running on the social media site Thursday, ask for donations and float the word ""treason"" in two different ways. One set of ads implies Democrats are making ""treason"" allegations against the president, while other ads could be interpreted as the campaign claiming Democrats pushing impeachment are treasonous—a loaded word the president himself has used against his critics.
""TREASON? First, the Left cried Quid Pro Quo, then bribery, and now TREASON? This entire HOAX has been JERRY-RIGGED by the Radical Democrats and we cannot put up with it any longer,"" one ad reads. The ad appears to be referencing House Democrats evolving impeachment argument against the president, which has at times both focused on quid pro quo and bribery allegations.

In a video posted with the campaign Facebook ads, President Trump calls impeachment a ""coup"" by Democrats who are ""going after me because I'm fighting for you.""
However, there’s no evidence that Democrats are pursuing treason allegations against Trump, as part of their impeachment inquiry, which the campaign’s ads imply.

While Democrats remain divided over the scope of potential impeachment charges against the president, House Judiciary Committee Democrats have suggested they could pursue articles on abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress — not treason.

The Trump campaign stands by the ads, telling ABC News the ""treason"" referenced in the ads refers to a line in Professor Pamela Karlan's opening statement at last week's House Judiciary impeachment hearing where the Stanford professor, who Democrats called to testify, listed the impeachable offenses detailed in the U.S. Constitution: Bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors, and treason.

""The ad is completely factual and the campaign stands by it,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News. ""If liberals don’t want us to point out that they accused the president of treason maybe they shouldn’t orchestrate hearings that do that.""
Karlan's comment came in the context of her arguing that an ""impeachable offense,"" as detailed by the framers of the constitution, ""is a president’s decision to sacrifice the national interest for his own private ends.""

"" 'Treason,' the first thing listed, lay in an individual’s giving aid to foreign enemies—that is, putting a foreign adversary’s interests above the United States,"" the professor said quoting the Constitution.

However, the two ads in question from the Trump campaign that reference ""treason"" do not mention Karlan and instead call out ""Radical Democrats"" and specifically House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler.
When asked by ABC News about the Trump campaign ads and whether treason is being considered as a possible charge against Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the president's campaign

""I'm not responding to anything about the president's campaign. They have no association to the facts, truth, or the Constitution of the United States. So I'm not responding to anything they do,” Pelosi told ABC News.

In another set of ads, the campaign questions the Democrats' motives for moving forward with impeachment.

""TREASON? Jerry Nadler has taken over this Impeachment Hearing Scam and has turned it into even more of a circus than it already was,"" the ad reads.

The ads including the word ""treason"" continue to heighten the president's anti impeachment language, given that according to federal law, those who commit treason against the United States “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined.”

According to the U.S. Constitution, ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.""

Trump does have a history himself of using the word to fire back at his critics—including in May when the president accused federal investigators of ""treason"" over the FBI's investigation into Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. In regards to the Russia investigation, Democrats have also invoked the word in the past, with Hillary Clinton's former running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, saying in 2017 that the president's son Donald Trump Jr. may have committed treason by taking a meeting with a Russian lawyer under the assumption of getting dirt on Clinton.

Since Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry back in September, the president's campaign has progressively ratcheted up its language pushing back against House Democrats. The word “treason” popped up in a fundraising email that was blasted to millions of supporters earlier this week.

“TREASON?” read the subject line of an email asking for donations sent out on Wednesday, which would go on to suggest Democrats were pushing treason allegations against the president similar to the Facebook ads posted Friday.

In another fundraising email sent to supporters earlier on Friday, the Trump campaign used some of its most incendiary language yet—declaring to the president's supporters that impeachment is a ""war"" and Democrats are trying to ""STEAL"" the 2020 election.

“They all HATE you,” the fundraising email reads. “That’s why they want to steal your vote.""
The Trump campaign’s Facebook ads come as the social media giant faces increased scrutiny over its policy of not removing misleading or false political ads, and as Twitter's recent ban on political advertising ramps up pressure ahead of the 2020 election.

Facebook did not immediately provide comment when asked but pointed ABC News to the company's policy of not sending political ads to third party fact checkers to review.

The Trump campaign maintains that impeachment will be a big win for their reelection hopes next year. In the 72 hours after Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry announcement, the team said it raised $15 million in small-dollar donations, including 50,000 new donors.

This year the campaign has spent $16.5 million on Facebook ads, according to data from Facebook's political ad transparency reports. The campaign has dropped over $2 million on Facebook ads focused on impeachment.

GOP senator repeats debunked narrative about which country meddled in 2016 election,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senator-repeats-debunked-narrative-country-meddled-2016/story?id=67439913,"
GOP Sen. John Kennedy was taking heat on Monday, including from Hillary Clinton, for doubling down on his assertion that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, this despite the U.S. intelligence community's clear assessment that Russia was responsible.

""I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,"" Kennedy told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.
Kennedy asserted that news media reports indicate that the former Ukrainian president also favored the former secretary of state to win the presidency over then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""I think it's been well documented in the Financial Times, in Politico, in the Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise,"" Kennedy said.

""The fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton,"" the Louisiana Republican added.
NBC's Chuck Todd pressed Kennedy during the Sunday television interview, asking the senator if he had been ""duped"" by Russian propaganda, adding that U.S. intelligence officials had reportedly briefed senators in recent weeks about Russia's campaign to frame Ukraine.

Kennedy responded that he did not attend the briefing.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York blasted Kennedy for making what he called ""outlandish claims.""

""Let me be clear, the charge that Ukraine had something to do with the Russian meddling in 2016 is a lie spread by Vladimir Putin. To get things off his back. Putin and Russian intelligence services invented that lie to muddy the waters and distract from the fact that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in our elections,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday.

""And now, disgracefully, we have sitting U.S. senators helping spread that propaganda, in an effort to defend the president,"" Schumer said. ""Republicans must stop claiming that Ukraine had anything to do with election Interference in 2016. Repeating these claims, even speculating about them, is doing Putin's job for him. I urge my Republican colleagues, they know who they are, to stop spreading these lies which hurts our democracy.""

Last week, Kennedy similarly suggested that there was still a possibility that Ukraine was responsible for the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails in 2016.

He later walked those comments back, claiming he had misheard the question during an interview.

Despite Kennedy's most recent claim, there is no evidence that suggests the Ukraine government aided Clinton in 2016.

At the Kremlin's direction, Russia's intelligence services waged a pro-Trump disinformation campaign on social media and secretly stole tens of thousands of private emails from the Democratic National Committee, the U.S. intelligence community concluded.

""Sen. Kennedy, why are you parroting Russian propaganda that U.S. intelligence officials tell us are designed to divide our country? Did you miss the briefing that day?"" Clinton tweeted on Monday.
The White House's former top Russia expert Fiona Hill, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last month as part of the House impeachment inquiry, said that the theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election is ""a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""

Kennedy later responded to Clinton, telling the former Democratic nominee: ""Bless your heart, Madame Secretary. I hope you are well.""Bless your heart, Madame Secretary. I hope you are well.
On Monday, Trump tweeted his thanks to Kennedy for his performance during the interview.

CBP reverses course on mandatory facial recognition program,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/customs-border-protection-reverses-mandatory-facial-recognition-program/story?id=67525963,"
U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Thursday it no longer plans to move forward with a facial recognition program that would conduct a mandatory scan of all U.S. citizens arriving or departing the country at airports and ports of entry, reversing course on a Trump administration plan.

Customs currently permits U.S. citizens to voluntarily opt-in for the photographs. But a proposal published by the Office of Information and Regulatory affairs stipulates that ""all travelers, including U.S. citizens, may be required to be photographed upon entry and/or departure.”
""There are no current plans to require U.S. citizens to provide photographs upon entry and exit from the United States,"" a Customs and Border Protection spokesman said in a statement. ""CBP intends to have the planned regulatory action regarding U.S. citizens removed from the unified agenda next time it is published.”

CBP says they initially considered including U.S. citizens in their bio-metric entry-exit program due to the logistical challenges of having separate entry processes for U.S. citizens and foreign nationals at airports nationwide.
But after significant pushback from the American Civil Liberties Union and members of Congress, the CBP reversed course to allow U.S. citizens to continue to voluntarily participate in the bio-metric entry-exit program.

Earlier this year, U.S. Customs officials announced that the photos of roughly 100,000 travelers were hacked as part of a ""malicious cyber-attack"" on a federal contractor.
The reversal won praise from Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who led a bipartisan effort in Congress along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to stop mandatory facial scanning.

“This is a victory for every single American traveler who flies on a plane, and a reminder that the we must remain vigilant protectors of our right to privacy,” Markey said. “Thanks to swift and public pressure, Homeland Security is 
reversing course and not moving forward with its dystopian facial recognition proposal at U.S. airports."""
"President Jimmy Carter discharged from hospital, looks forward to rest, recovery",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-jimmy-carter-returns-hospital-forward-returning-home/story?id=67448771,"
Former President Jimmy Carter was discharged from the hospital Wednesday after being treated for a urinary tract infection, according to The Carter Center.

Carter is looking forward to ""further rest and recovery at home in Plains, Georgia,"" according to a Wednesday statement from the organization, and ""he and Mrs. Carter wish everyone peace and joy this holiday season.""

This most recent hospitalization came after multiple other injuries or illnesses, including when he suffered a subdural hematoma, a serious condition, and needed brain surgery.
The Maranatha Baptist Church, in Plains, Georgia, said Monday afternoon that Carter, the oldest ex-president in U.S. history, would be not be teaching for the rest of the month. The church released the statement before learning of Carter's return to the hospital. The Sunday school teachings -- a tradition of Carter's for many years -- were canceled after he underwent brain surgery in late November.

""Our other miracle is President Carter,"" the Maranatha Baptist Church said in a statement. ""Although he has been released from the hospital from his surgery, we want to make sure he takes the full surgery recovery time before teaching again. For this reason, his Sunday School lessons on December 8 and December 22, 2019 will be cancelled. His niece, Kim Fuller will deliver inspiring messages throughout the month of December.""
Carter was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta the day before Thanksgiving after spending two weeks in the medical facility following brain surgery as a result of a subdural hematoma. He suffered the injury in a fall, one of many he's suffered in recent months.

""The Carters are grateful for all the prayers, cards, and notes they have received and hope everyone will join them in enjoying a special Thanksgiving,"" a statement from the Carter Center read after his release last week.
Carter sustained a 'minor pelvic fracture' in October after falling and required 14 stitches above his brow after another fall in early October.

In his first of three falls this year, the former president underwent hip surgery in May after falling before a turkey hunting excursion.

Carter served as governor of Georgia for one term before running for president in 1976. He defeated Republican Gerald Ford in a competitive race in the general election, but served just one term before being defeated by eventual two-term President Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Democrats plot week ahead for impeachment proceedings,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-plot-week-ahead-impeachment-proceedings-donald-trump/story?id=67570198,"
Roughly two dozen Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, dressed casually for the weekend, gathered in the grand hearing room in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill Saturday for the first of two days of preparation ahead of a crucial week in impeachment proceedings against the president.

Working over pizza with Democratic lawyers and aides, they prepared for Monday's hearing with majority and minority lawyers who will argue for and against impeachment, using the evidence gathered by the committees.

A Democratic official told reporters on Saturday that Democrats intend to use Monday's hearing to make their ""theory of the case"" against President Donald Trump and his abuse of power.
The hearing will spotlight both Democratic and Republican attorneys from both the House Intelligence and House Judiciary committees, who will present evidence they gathered during previous public and closed-door hearings. Those hearings have focused on whether Trump withheld military aid and a potential White House meeting to Ukraine in exchange for the launch of an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Majority counsel Barry Burke and minority counsel Stephen Castor will appear before the Judiciary Committee, while Castor will again appear, now alongside majority counsel Daniel Goldman, before the Intelligence Committee.

As members gathered for their Saturday prep session, they were joined by committee staff and lawyers, as well as legal expert Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar and Harvard Law School professor who has been advising House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats. Tribe, according to sources, fielded questions on impeachment before Democrats began their mock hearing session.
Democrats, according to the official, plan to argue on Monday that Trump's use of his office for personal political gain ahead of the election represents the ""framers' nightmare,"" by acting in a way that ""betrays our national security and corrupts our elections using a foreign power.""

They will argue that Trump's actions were part of a ""repeated pattern,"" and that the Ukraine episode is important because it represents a ""future pattern,"" highlighting the urgency of moving quickly to impeach the president ahead of 2020.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said after Saturday's prep session that they are using it to put ""law and facts together to begin to think about the next step.""

""Speaker Pelosi has charged us with writing articles of impeachment and we're in the process of exploring every possible dimension of that process,"" Raskin said.
In terms of what to expect on Monday, Raskin described the process as a ""scrupulously equal, fair, open and transparent"" process.

Republicans on the committee have argued that Trump’s actions did not constitute a threat to national security or a quid pro quo because, among other things, the president was rightfully concerned about corruption in Ukraine and because Ukrainian officials did not know aid was being withheld.

On Friday night, the House Intelligence Committee formally transmitted its 300-page Ukraine report to the Judiciary Committee for consideration in impeachment proceedings. The Judiciary Committee majority staff also released their own report, ""Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment,"" updating a similar report from the 1998 Clinton impeachment proceedings on the constitutional grounds for impeachment.
""The Framers worst nightmare is what we are facing in this very moment. President Trump abused his power, betrayed our national security, and corrupted our elections, all for personal gain,"" Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. ""The Constitution details only one remedy for this misconduct: impeachment.""

Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the ranking member on the Judiciary panel, called on Nadler to postpone the hearing after Democrats' ""last-minute"" transmission of evidence, claiming it showed ""just how far Democrats have gone to pervert basic fairness.""

No additional hearings are scheduled after Monday, but Democrats are expected to introduce and consider multiple articles charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction as early as next week -- ahead of a potential vote on the House floor the week before Christmas.

Former Trump physician Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson running for Texas congressional seat,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-physician-navy-rear-adm-ronny-jackson-running/story?id=67608077,"
Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, the former presidential physician and one-time veterans affairs secretary pick, is running in the Republican primary for Texas' 13th Congressional District, according to the Texas Republican Party.

Filing on the last day to do so, Jackson is joining a crowded primary field. There are at least 14 candidates are vying for the Republican nomination for the seat currently held by Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, according to the state party. Thornberry announced at the end of July that he would not seek re-election for the district he's represented since 1995.
Jackson resigned from his job at White House on Dec. 1, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere told ABC News. At the time of his resignation, Jackson served as an assistant to the president and chief medical adviser, a newly created position that he took on in February.
Instead of providing medical care at the White House, in this last role, Jackson gave ""technical policy advice"" on public health issues, including veterans' issues and the opioid epidemic, an administration official who is not authorized to speak publicly told ABC News after Jackson's promotion.

Before he held that job, Jackson served as the doctor to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. While he remained in the White House medical unit, he gave up his job as presidential physician when Trump tapped him in March 2018 to serve as secretary to the Veterans Affairs Department. Dr. Sean Conley, a Navy officer, took over the job, and is still Trump's doctor.

The Senate never voted on Jackson's nomination to be veterans affairs secretary. After facing allegations of misconduct, including improperly dispensing medications, wrecking a government vehicle after drinking and mistreatment of White House colleagues, Jackson withdrew his name from consideration in late April 2018.

He denied the allegations in a statement at the time, saying they were ""completely false and fabricated.""

Those allegations are still under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, spokeswoman Dwrena Allen said on Monday.
When he withdrew his name, Trump continued to back Jackson, saying in an interview on Fox News that the Navy doctor would've been great, and maintained that the allegations were false, saying, ""They are trying to destroy a man.""

In January 2018, after the president's first physical exam since taking office, Jackson found himself in the spotlight, giving a glowing review of Trump's health.
Jackson told reporters in a White House press briefing after the physical that Trump ""has incredibly good genes.""

""I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old. I don't know,"" he said at the time.

Giuliani associate asks court to release material for impeachment inquiry,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawyer-giuliani-associate-petitions-court-release-documents-recordings/story?id=67446948,"
An attorney representing Rudy Giuliani's indicted associate, Lev Parnas, asked that materials seized during his client’s arrest be released to the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

Joseph Bondy, the lawyer for Parnas, asked a federal court in Manhattan on Monday for an update on discovery in his client’s case, specifically referring to additional electronic devices that were seized in court-authorized searches following Parnas’ arrest at the Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. in October.

Federal prosecutors described the material seized from Parnas and his three co-defendants to be ""voluminous"" including at least 29 electronic devices.
""We think a superseding indictment is likely,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Zolkind said, referring to the case against Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman, adding any additional charges would be brought ahead of a trial but did not specify who the target of those charges would be.

Federal prosecutors have been investigating Giuliani’s business dealings as part of the case against Parnas and Fruman, according to sources.
As ABC News has previously reported, the House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Parnas, an associate of Giuliani, President Trump’s personal attorney, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.
The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week.

Sources told ABC News the tapes were provided as part of that congressional subpoena issued to Parnas, and the former Giuliani ally also provided a number of documents both in English and Ukrainian to the committee in two separate productions, sources told ABC News.

Sources familiar with the matter told ABC News last month that some of the material sought by congressional investigators is already in possession of federal investigators within the Southern District of New York and thus held up from being turned over. It is unclear if this material is what Bondy was asking the court to release to Congress Monday.""

So far, Parnas is the only defendant in the New York case to cooperate with the House Intelligence committee’s investigation.
Parnas was carrying 6 phones, tablets and computers when he was arrested, Zolkind said, adding that another 8 devices were seized at his home.

Zolkind suggested Parnas could speed up the extraction of material from his phones if he would provide the passwords, rather than relying on the FBI’s forensic experts.

Bondy also said there are paper records in the government’s possession that his client would like to turn over.

A protective order governing the case requires Parnas to get court approval before turning over to Congress any materials seized as part of the criminal investigation.

""I expect to grant that request,"" Judge Paul Oetken said"
President Donald Trump 'abused his power': Rep. Zoe Lofgren,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-abused-power-improperly-put-thumb-scale/story?id=67569303,"
President Donald Trump ""hits all the buttons"" on high crimes and misdemeanors, abusing his presidential power in a way similar to President Richard Nixon, said House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., on ABC's ""This Week.""

""In the case of President Trump, not only has he abused his power to improperly put his thumb on the scale for the election, he used a foreign power to do it. And that really hits all of the buttons that the founding fathers were concerned about,"" Lofgren told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.

""The Constitution says, the Congress shall have the sole authority when it comes to impeachment. And so the question is, with the evidence we have, can we make a sound conclusion? I think we can,"" the California Democrat added.

In response, a key defender of the president's dealings in Ukraine, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., criticized Democrats' standards of impeachment for Trump.

""What is so dizzying, George, is the evolving standard for impeachment from Democrats. Through most of 2019, Nancy Pelosi said she opposed impeachment, not because the Mueller facts weren't strong enough in her view, but because it wasn't bipartisan,"" Gaetz told Stephanopoulos.
Both representatives serve on the House Judiciary Committee, the congressional panel tasked with drawing up articles of impeachment against the president.

Lofgren has played a role in every impeachment inquiry in recent United States history. During the early 1970s Watergate scandal, Lofgren helped draft articles of impeachment for President Richard Nixon while working as a congressional staffer to a member of the House Judiciary Committee.Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who has participated in the impeachment inquiries into Clinton, Nixon and now Trump, says Nixon ""abused his power"" to improperly influence the election, but Trump not only ""abused his power;"" he ""used a foreign power to do it."" https://t.co/Rg6YYFXE6Q pic.twitter.com/WbjA8Av1EL— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2019 Rep.

The two representatives also disagreed on whether Trump should call witnesses to the panel.

""The president has improperly withheld important witnesses,"" Lofgren said on ""This Week"" Sunday. ""The idea of absolute immunity is preposterous.""

Gaetz disagreed, telling Stephanopoulos, ""The president has to make decisions not only for him but for the presidency.""

""I think it would inure to the president's advantage to have people testify who could exculpate him, but they -- we want to preserve an executive branch where there are out-of-the-box strategy sessions where people come up with crazy ideas and reject those ideas and hone them,"" he added.
During the Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearing on Wednesday, four legal scholars evaluated whether the president's involvement with Ukraine constituted an impeachable offense. Three of the witnesses, invited by the Democrats, argued that President Donald Trump abused presidential power in his dealings with Ukraine. The other witness, invited by Republicans, disagreed. He said that he believed there was not enough evidence to remove Trump from office.
On ""This Week,"" the Florida Republican also called ""odd"" the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's trip to Ukraine this past week, which Gaetz had previously question in an interview on CNN.
""But it is weird that he is over there,"" Gaetz said on of Giuliani's trip on Sunday. ""I'm very grateful that very soon after I made those comments on CNN, the president put out a statement that said Rudy Giuliani does want to come into Congress and explain his role, explain what he's been up to.""

""And I believe that the president urging Mayor Giuliani to provide that clarity to the Congress will be helpful in resolving what seems to be odd having him over there at this time,"" Gaetz added.

The Judiciary Committee will hold its second public impeachment hearing on Monday when lawyers for the Democrats and Republicans from the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees will present findings from their investigations."
Experts at Trump impeachment hearing outline ‘serious abuse of power’,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-case-enters-historic-phase-house-judiciary/story?id=67471278,"
The investigation into President Donald Trump entered a historic next phase on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the constitutional grounds for drafting articles of impeachment.
The process of drawing up any articles could begin within days following testimony from legal experts about the evidence of ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" the Constitution requires.

Four legal scholars -- Professors Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law and Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School -- each made passionate arguments.

Among the key questions they addressed: Are Trump’s actions the danger the Founders warned about? Is impeachment the remedy they envisioned?

The three law professors called by Democrats -- Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt -- argued that Trump had committed impeachable offenses while Turley, the constitutional scholar called by Republicans, insisted the threshold had not been met -- at least not yet -- and that Democrats were in a rush to judgment.
Much of the focus was on the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, who mostly succeeded in controlling Republican objections and maintaining the momentum of the Democrats' impeachment drive.

Here is how the hearing unfolded. 

FiveThirtyEight live blogged the hearing as well here -- including analysis from ABC News Political Director Rick Klein and ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks.

6:32 p.m.

Nadler gavels the hearing to a close after almost eight hours of testimony as Republicans continue to raise objections.

6:26 p.m.

Nadler begins his closing statement.

""If President Trump's action's aren't impeachable, nothing is impeachable,"" Nadler quotes professor Michael Gerhardt as saying.

""All these proceedings have all the protections afforded prior presidents,"" Nadler says, arguing the Republicans are focusing on process because they cannot make a defense on the facts.

After invoking the Constitution, Nadler says, ""I urge my colleagues to stand behind the oath you have taken.""

ABC News' reporter Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: After Republicans spent the day using Nadler's words against him, arguing that the current case against President Trump doesn't meet the bar he set to proceed with impeachment in the past, Nadler ended the day by saying his three conditions have been met.

""Let me be clear, all three parts of that test have been met,"" Nadler said.

""First, yes, the president has committed an impeachable offense. The president asked the foreign government to intervene in our elections, then got caught, then obstructed the investigators twice. Our witnesses told us in no uncertain terms this conduct constitute---constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors, including abuse of power.""

""Second, yes, the president's alleged offense represent the direct threat to the constitutional order. Professor Karlan warned, joining a foreign government into our election process is an especially serious abuse of power because it undermines democracy itself. Professor Feldman echoed, if we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy, we live in a monarchy or under a dictatorship,"" Nadler continued.

""President Trump's actions represent the threat to our national security and an urgent threat to the integrity of the next election. Third, yes, we should not proceed unless at least some of the citizens who supported the President in the last election are willing to come with us. A majority of this country is clearly prepared to impeach and remove President Trump.,"" Nadler said.

6:25 p.m.

Will you let us know where we're going? Ranking Member Doug Collins asks Nadler as the hearing nears a close, demanding more fact witnesses, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.

Nadler has said Republicans will have an opportunity to call other witnesses.

5:53 p.m.


Pamela Karlan has just apologized for referencing the president's son, Barron.

""If I can say one thing, I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president's son. It was wrong of me to do that. I wish the president would apologize for the things he's said wrong, but I do regret having said that.""Pamela Karlan apologizes for referencing Barron Trump in hearing: “It was wrong of me to do that.” https://t.co/v9gZS9O73S pic.twitter.com/6ZiYfx7Rii
5:05 p.m.


First lady Melania Trump weighed in on her son Barron's name coming up during the hearing when one of the law professors, Pamela Karlan, made a play on words about his name while making a point that a president can't be treated the same as a king. ""While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,"" she said.

Trump tweeted, ""A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.""A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.
A few minutes later, a Republican member had the tweet entered into the official hearing record.

4:17 p.m.

As Nadler calls a brief recess with about 20 members left to ask questions, ABC's Anne Flaherty points out some of the key takeaways from the hearing so far.

In her analysis, she writes that one of the biggest threads is that the legal experts brought by Democrats all argue that Trump's behavior is a textbook example of the actions the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they defined impeachment.

The lawyer brought by Republicans had a different argument that Democrats are moving too quickly and could set a dangerous precedent.
3:41 p.m.

ABC News Capitol Hill reporter Sarah Kolinovsky reports that during breaks, members of the Judiciary Committee gave their takes on what they think are the most important points made during the hearing.
Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal highlighted the idea ""'when a president obstructs Congress in getting the information that we need to get, that essentially torpedoes the balance of power that is built into the Constitution.' I think that that is a very, very important point, and we should come back to that over and over and over again,"" she said, pointing to a possible obstruction article of impeachment.

She also underscored the fact that no Republicans have attempted to defend the president's actions -- it's been all process, no substance.

""They tried to talk about the process, how it might be too fast, how this, that, but I think it’s very very compelling that there has not been a defense presented of the actual facts that are on the record,"" Jayapal said.

The only Republican to speak, Ranking Member Doug Collins, continued to deride the process of the hearing.

""I think the American people frankly are getting lost and I think that’s one of the things we’re going to be looking at going forward in this, but it also brings me back to my question for my chairman, is: 'Why are we simply doing this with no plan to go forward with actual fact witnesses?'”

He added, “I respect all the law professors, they're doing their job as they said they would, but this does not move the needle as far as understanding why we’re in this process to start with.""

3:35 p.m.


After the hearing resumed at 2:43 p.m. the president's son Barron came up in one exchange.

When Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas asked Karlan, ""What comparisons, Professor Karlan, can we make between kings that the framers were afraid of and the president's conduct today? she responded, ""So, kings could do no wrong, because the king's word was law. And contrary to what President Trump has said, Article II does not give him the power to do anything he wants. And I’ll just give you one example that shows you the difference between him and a king, which is the Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. So, while the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron.""
Karlan's comment received some applause in the hearing room, but the White House shot back at 3:12 p.m.

""Classless move by a Democratic “witness”. Prof Karlan uses a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline. And what’s worse, it’s met by laughter in the hearing room. What is being done to this country is no laughing matter,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted.Classless move by a Democratic “witness”.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders reports that Republicans later went after Karlan for her comments about Barron Trump. In a contentious back and forth during his five minutes of questioning, Rep. Gaetz said her earlier comments make her look mean and doesn't give her argument credibility.
""Now, let me also suggest that when you invoke the president's son's name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument. It makes you look mean. I makes you look like you're attacking someone's family, the minor child of the president of the United States,"" Gaetz said.

1:31 p.m.

Nadler calls a break for votes.

12:54 p.m.

ABC News' congressional reporter Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: The expert witness picked by Republicans, Jomathan Turley, is also raising questions about the timeline, arguing that Democrats are rushing to impeach Trump prematurely without hearing from all witnesses and allowing the courts to adjudicate disputes over documents and testimony between Congress and the White House.

""If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you are criticizing the president for doing. We have a third branch that deals with conflicts of the other two branches, and what comes out of there, and what you do with it is the very definition of legitimacy,"" Turley says.
Turley also seemed to question whether Democrats are actually aiming to build a successful impeachment case for a Senate trial. ""Fast is not good for impeachment. Narrow, fast impeachments have failed, just ask Johnson,"" he said. ""This is the narrowest impeachment in history.""Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley says Democrats should subpoena witnesses and let it play out in the courts: ""If you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL pic.twitter.com/zIM0VT4y1w
12:29 p.m.

Nadler gavels the hearing back into session as questioning by the Republican side commences.

The expert witness for the Republicans, Jonathan Turley, makes an extended argument about why impeachment, especially for bribery, isn't warranted based on the evidence.

Turley says bribery is not an overarching concept as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has cited, saying that while there was no legal definition included in the Constitution, that didn't mean the term didn't have a specific meaning.

He says these crimes have meaning and that bribery has been specifically defined as accepting money or gifts as a head of state or person in public office.

""So I don't think that dog will hunt in the 18th century and I don't think it will hunt today,"" he says, adding that the Supreme Court has ruled you can't apply a ""boundless interpretation"" to a crime like bribery. ""This isn't improvisational jazz. Close enough is not good enough. If you're going to accuse a president of bribery, you need to make it stick because you're trying to remove a duly elected president,""Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley: ""This isn't improvisational jazz. Close enough is not good enough. If you're going to accuse a president of bribery, you need to make it stick because you're trying to remove a duly elected president."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL pic.twitter.com/8maBDQSMTo
Turley also says that the evidence presented so far does not establish the crime of obstruction of justice, saying that he also been a critic of the obstruction article against President Nixon.

He argues that articles of impeachment on obstruction or abuse of power without proof of the alleged underlying alleged crimes weren't warranted. The president's supporter made a similar argument after the Mueller investigation.

Turley maintains that the judicial branch also has a role in deciding disputes between the president and Congress about what information has to be turned over and that an obstruction case is much stronger if Congress can argue the president defies a court order.

""President Trump has gone to the courts, he's allowed to do that. We have three branches, not two,"" he said, going on to criticize how quickly the Democrats have pursued the impeachment inquiry.
""It's a perfect storm. You set an incredibly short period, demand a huge amount of information, and when the president goes to court, you then impeach him,"" he says.

12:27 p.m.


ABC News' Ben Gittleson reports on the president's reaction to the hearing:

""It is the most unfair thing that anybody's ever seen,"" Trump told reporters during a photo op earlier Wednesday with Italy's prime minister at the NATO summit in London. ""They would have done much better if they gave us equal representation, because the public gets it. But just look at today. Now, I don't think too many people are going to watch, because it's going to be boring. Alright? In fact, you're here, I guess you're here and we'll supersede it, right? But not a lot of people are going to be watching today, but just think of this: Constitutional lawyers, they get three, and we get one. What kind of a deal is that? You don't need a constitutional lawyer, because there was nothing done wrong. Zero done wrong.""
Asked to comment on the House Democrats' impeachment report that came out Tuesday and the hearing today, Trump replied: ""It’s a joke, everybody is saying it. And I watched reviews, I watched Hannity, Sean Hannity, I watched Laura Ingram, I watched Tucker Carlson, I watched a lot of other legal scholars, frankly, I watched some people with great legal talent and highly respected -- Alan Dershowitz, and many more, many more.""

12:10 p.m.

Chairman Nadler calls a brief break.

12:05 p.m.

Feldman touches on the argument that the president did not commit a crime or impeachable offense because Ukraine ultimately got the military aid without announcing investigations.

“The possibility that the president might get caught in the process of attempting to abuse his office and then not be able to pull it off does not undercut in any way the impeachability of the acts,” he says.

“President Nixon was subject to articles of impeachment preferred by this committee for attempting to cover up the Watergate break-in. The fact that the president was not ultimately successful in covering up the break-in was not grounds for not impeaching him. The attempt itself is the impeachable act,” he says.

Gerhardt adds that every president who has been impeached failed to achieve the goals they set out to achieve, or at least to get away with it.

“One of the things to understand from the history of impeachment is everybody who's impeached has failed. They've failed to get what they wanted. And what they wanted was not just to do what they did, but to get away with it,” he said.
ABC News' Devin Dwyer notes that as we've seen in polling and heard first-hand from voters -- Republican and Democrat -- there is a prevalent view in public opinion that judgment on the president's might be better left to voters in the 2020 election. 'What's the point in all this' - some say - 'especially if Trump won't be removed by the Senate? Just fight it out at the ballot box next year.'

Today, Democrats and the witnesses are attempting to directly answer those skeptics.

""We are all aware that the next election is looming, but we cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis. The integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake,"" Chairman Nadler said in his opening.

""The president has shown us his pattern of conduct. If we do not act to hold him in check now, President Trump will almost certainly try again to solicit interference in the election for his personal political gain.""

Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt all echoed those points prominently in their testimonies.

Feldman said the historical origins of impeachment were rooted in a fear a president might ""corrupt the electoral process and ensure his re-election.""

11:52 a.m.

Karlan makes a point about the public testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about what he says he understood Trump wanted from Ukraine's president.

""The most chilling line for me of the entire process is the following: Ambassador Sondland said ""he had to announce the investigations,"" Kalran, the Stanford law professor says. ""He's talking about President Zelenskiy. ""He had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it."" And then he said ""I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was they had to be announced in some form.

""And what I took that to mean was this was not about whether Vice President Biden actually committed corruption or not. This was about injuring somebody who the president thinks of as a particularly hard opponent.""

11:50 a.m.

Karlan says Trump’s actions in regard to Ukraine establish bribery as a “high crime or misdemeanor,” even though that definition can be different from the definition of bribery under criminal law.

She says bribery as it relates to impeachment is based on how it was understood in 18th century common law.

“When you took private benefits or when you asked for private benefits in return for an official act, or someone gave them to you to influence an official act, that was bribery,” she said.
11:47 a.m.

ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce notes that Chairman Nadler has dropped a lot of hints about the likely scope of the articles of impeachment this morning, suggesting they could pursue all constitutional grounds.

“Never before has a president engaged in a course of conduct that included all of the acts that most concerned the Framers,” Nadler said.

So far, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff have said Trump’s conduct could constitute bribery but here Nadler is suggesting it also rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.
And in his line of questioning now, Democratic Counsel Norm Eisen is suggesting they could pursue articles based on abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of congress and obstruction of justice.

Right off the bat, Eisen asked the witnesses “did President Trump commit impeachable high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power based on that evidence and those findings?”

Feldman, Karlan and Gephardt all said yes. “We three are unanimous,” Gephardt said.

In his opening statement, Nadler leaned heavily into obstruction, saying “there is precedent for recommending impeachment here,” noting other presidents have been impeached for obstruction.

And Nadler suggested they may broaden the scope to include obstruction of the Mueller probe as well.

11:43 a.m.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders reports from the hearing room that lawyers for the committee are expected to conduct a majority of the questioning in today’s hearing.

The majority counsel Norm Eisen, now questioning the experts, is a former “ethics czar” in the Obama administration and former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic. Eisen served as special counsel and special assistant to the president for ethics and government reform in the White House from 2009-2011.Constitutional scholar Noah Feldman: ""If we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy—we live in a monarchy, or we live under a dictatorship."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL #ImpeachmentHearings pic.twitter.com/IGP6lp3Fds
He is the founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) -- a liberal watchdog group that filed the emoluments lawsuit against Trump, claiming he has violated the Constitution by profiting from his business empire while serving in office.

The Republican counsel is Paul Taylor, a veteran committee lawyer who has also worked as an associate at two well-known private law firms, Kirkland & Ellis and Covington & Burling. He graduated from Yale in 1991 and from Harvard law school in 1994.

His official title is Chief Republican Counsel, House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.

11:20 a.m.

The expert witness called by Republicans, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, disagrees with the other constitutional scholars.

Turley argues the facts presented by the House Intelligence Committee don't meet the necessary standard for impeachment.

He makes a point to say that he does not support and voted against President Trump and has been critical of his policies, rhetoric, and comments about Hunter Biden.
Turley calls the current legal case for impeachment not just “woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous, as the basis for the impeachment of an American president.”

“I am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. If the House proceeds solely on the Ukrainian allegations, this impeachment would stand out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.,” Turley says in his opening statement.

“That does not bode well for future presidents who are working in a country often sharply and, at times, bitterly divided,” he says.

In a lighter moment, he appeals to the political divisions around the country today, asking the committee to look beyond politics and think carefully about this impeachment.

""I get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad . . . and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad,"" he said, asking if an impeachment will ""make us all less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration,"" Turley continues.

""It is not wrong because President Trump is right. His call was anything but “perfect” and his reference to the Bidens was highly inappropriate... No, it is wrong because this is not how an American president should be impeached.""Jonathan Turley: ""I am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. I believe this impeachment not only fails to satisfy the standard of past impeachments but would create a dangerous precedent"" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL pic.twitter.com/8Wo4ZR5GpV
11:05 a.m.


The third law professor called by Democrats, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of law, agrees with Pamela Karlan and Noah Feldman, the previous two witnesses.

""The record compiled this far shows that the president has committed several impeachable offenses, including bribery, abuse of power in soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit himself personally, obstructing justice and obstructing Congress,"" Gerhardt says.
Gerhardt said the context and the gravity of a president's conduct are a big part of whether it fits the definition of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and meets the standard for impeachment.

""Both the context and gravity of the president's conduct are clear,"" Gerhardt said, citing testimony that the president wanted Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into the Bidens but not that he specifically said he wanted the investigations carried out.

""Because it could then be used in this country to manipulate the public into casting aside his political rival,"" Gerhardt says.UNC School of Law's Michael Gerhardt: ""I cannot help but conclude that this president has attacked each of the Constitution's safeguards against establishing a monarchy in this country."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL #ImpeachmentHearings pic.twitter.com/5uzAEpQYdP
10:58 a.m.

Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan speaks next -- firing an opening shot at the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, GOP Rep. Doug Collins, after he suggested in his opening statement that the legal experts hadn't had time to digest the 300-page report released by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

""Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts. So, I'm insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don't care about those facts, but everything I read on those occasions tells me that when President Trump invited, indeed, demanded foreign involvement in our upcoming election,"" she says.Stanford Law School's Pamela Karlan tells GOP Rep. Doug Collins she ""read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing,"" so she is ""insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor, I don't care about these facts."" https://t.co/InY7If80dy pic.twitter.com/FjIBWo1F44
""He struck at the very heart of what makes this a republic to which we pledge allegiance, that demand as Professor Feldman just explained, constituted an abuse of power. I want to explain in my testimony, drawing a foreign government into our elections is an especially serious abuse of power because it undermines democracy itself.""

""The very idea that a president might seek the aid of a foreign government in his re-election campaign would have horrified [the Founders], but based on the evidentiary record, that is what President Trump has done,"" Karlan says.Stanford Law School's Pamela Karlan: ""When Pres. Trump invited—indeed, demanded—foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this a 'republic.'""""That demand...constituted an abuse of power."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL #ImpeachmentHearings pic.twitter.com/MsbL7zMxPi
Karlan said the current case is unprecedented because the president has ""doubled down"" on his actions to undermine American elections.

“What happened in 2016 was bad enough: there is widespread agreement that Russian operatives intervened to manipulate our political process. But that distortion is magnified if a sitting President abuses the powers of his office actually to invite foreign intervention,” Karlan says.

She compared President Trump’s actions to withhold aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to if the U.S. government withheld aid from a state impacted by natural disasters.

“Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that’s prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding. What would you think if, when your governor asked the federal government for the disaster assistance that Congress has provided, the President responded, “‘I would like you to do us a favor.’ I’ll meet with you and send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.”?” she says.

“Wouldn’t you know in your gut that such a president had abused his office, betrayed the national interest, and tried to corrupt the electoral process? I believe the evidentiary record shows wrongful acts on that scale here,"" Karlan says.

10:45 a.m.


Noah Feldman, the Harvard Law School law professor, testifies his analysis is that President Trump’s actions fit the constitutional definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
“On the basis of the testimony and evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency,” Feldman said, specifically citing Trump's request for Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy to pursue investigations into the Bidens and purported Ukraine interference in the 2016 election.Harvard Law School's Noah Feldman: ""On the basis of the testimony and the evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL pic.twitter.com/WkR0dwcNie
10:32 a.m.


ABC News' congressional reporter Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room:

Republicans are already trying to knock Chairman Jerry Nadler off of his game, interjecting multiple times on procedural matters. It won't be the last time they try to use the tools of the minority to air their concerns with what they argue is an unfair process against Trump.

Noteworthy that, on obstruction, Nadler made this comparison to President Bill Clinton's impeachment: ""In 1998, President Clinton physically gave his blood. President Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document, and directed every witness not to testify. Those are the facts before us.""

Republicans just forced a vote to shelve their request to compel Adam Schiff to testify before the committee. The motion to table passed (24-17) along party lines.

Republicans are afforded this ability under the impeachment inquiry resolution that laid out the parameters of the inquiry. They could, theoretically, continue forcing votes to bring other witnesses (the whistleblower, Hunter Biden, etc.) forward for the rest of the morning.

For now, they have decided to continue pelting Nadler with inquiries about the rules governing the hearing. After a few minutes of back-and-forth, Nadler is trying to get the witnesses to give their opening statements.
10: 20 a.m.

""What's not new is the facts,"" Ranking Members Doug Collins says in his opening statement. ""It's the same sad story,"" he says.

He argues the Founders were concerned about political impeachment ""because you just don't like the guy."" he says.GOP Rep. Doug Collins criticizes the impeachment process, saying the Founding Fathers were also ""really, really concerned about political impeachment because you just don't like the guy."" https://t.co/9B39DgMINL pic.twitter.com/Bj6q1QVA54
""You know what's driving this? "" Collins says. ""Two things, it's called the clock and the calendar, the clock and the calendar, most people in life what they truly value you look at their checkbook and their calendar, you know what they value. That's what this committee values. Time. They want to do it before the end of the year. Why? Because the chairman said it a few seconds ago, because we're scared of the elections last year that we'll lose again. So we got to do this now. The clock and the calendar are what's driving impeachment. Not the facts,""
""This is not an impeachment. This is just a simple railroad job, and today's [hearing] is a waste of time,"" Collins continues.

""It didn't start with Mueller, it didn't' start with a phone call ... it started with tears in Brooklyn in November 2016,"" he says.
10:06 a.m.

Chairman Jerry Nadler gavels the hearing open.

""The facts before are us are undisputed,"" the New York Democrat says, adding that President Trump has attacked witnesses who've testified previously.

""He did everything in his power to prevent the American people from learning about his conduct,"" he said.

Nadler stressed the Founders' concerns about foreign interference in elections and the president's lack of cooperation with congressional investigations.

""Never before has a president engaged in a course of conduct that included all of the acts that most concerned the Framers. The patriots who founded our country were not fearful men. They fought a war. They witnessed terrible violence. They overthrew a king. But as they met to frame our Constitution, those patriots still feared one threat above all---foreign interference in our elections,"" Nadler said in his opening statement.

""The storm in in which we find ourselves today was set in motion by President Trump,"" Nadler said in his opening statement.

""The president has shown us his pattern of conduct. If we do not act to hold him in check now, President Trump will almost certainly try again, to solicit interference in the election for his personal political gain,"" he added.Rep.

9:58 a.m.

Members and witnesses are starting to take their seats in the hearing room.

President Donald Trump has cancelled his conference in London scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Washington time, shortly after the hearing was supposed to get underway.

A GOP member of the Judiciary Committee and vocal critic of the impeachment inquiry, Rep. Matt Gaetz. told ABC News Senior Washington Reporter on ABC News Live that Republicans will continue to push to call their own witnesses to defend Trump, but said he sees the result of the House impeachment inquiry as a “foregone conclusion.”

As for Wednesday’s hearing, Gaetz said Republicans don’t have anything to prove and that Democrats think the testimony from “liberal law professors” will support their conclusions.
“Today will largely be legal analysis that I think will bore the country to death,” he said.GOP Rep. @mattgaetz to @ABC News: ""My belief is that you always take every opportunity you get, even in an unfair process, so if I were the president, I would have sent my team. But I can understand why they have such serious concerns."" https://t.co/hypKKF3rE5 pic.twitter.com/kXUmduNov6
9:35 a.m.

Three witnesses have been called by Democrats: Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, and Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law.

Testifying for Republicans will be Jonathan Turley of The George Washington University Law School.

Their opening statements have been made public.
Feldman says his analysis is that President Trump’s actions fit the constitutional definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

“On the basis of the testimony and evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency,” Feldman said in his prepared remarks, specifically citing his request for Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy to announce investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.

Feldman said the idea of impeachment is critical to the basis of American democracy, specifically the idea that unlike a king, the president is not above the law and there should be checks on a president.

“The framers believed that elections were not a sufficient check on the possibility of a president who abused his power by acting in a corrupt way. They were especially worried that a president might use the power of his office to influence the electoral process in his own favor. They concluded that the Constitution must provide for the impeachment of the president to assure that no one would be above the law,” he said.

Gerhardt compared Trump’s behavior to former President Richard Nixon, who famously resigned as Congress was considering whether to impeach him.

He says the president’s actions correspond which each of the three articles of impeachment against Nixon - obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and failure to comply with legislative subpoenas.
“The president’s serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,” he said in his opening statement, adding that even Nixon cooperated with congressional investigations.

Karlan speaks of the constitutional threshold.

""The list of impeachable offenses the Framers included in the Constitution shows that the essence of an impeachable offense is a president's decision to sacrifice the national interest for his own private ends. “Treason” lay in an individual’s giving aid to foreign enemies—that is, putting a foreign adversary’s interests above the United States’. “Bribery” occurred when an official solicited, received, or offered a personal favor or benefit to influence official action—that is, putting his private welfare above the national interest. And “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” captured the other ways in which a high official might, as Justice Joseph Story explained, “disregard . . . public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political office,” she says in her prepared remarks.

"Georgia governor set to tap Kelly Loeffler for open Senate seat, defying Trump",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-set-tap-kelly-loeffler/story?id=67444665,"
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is poised to tap businesswoman and Republican donor, Kelly Loeffler, as his appointment to the U.S. Senate, according to a source with direct knowledge of the decision, in a move that defies President Donald Trump's own wishes for the soon-to-be open seat.

Kemp's decision could potentially face sharp backlash from President Trump, who in the past weeks has called Gov. Kemp multiple times to push for him to pick Rep. Doug Collins, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and a staunch supporter of his in the ongoing impeachment probe, according to sources familiar with the effort, and his key allies.
Earlier on Monday, the president tweeted his admiration for Collins. ""Great job by @RepDougCollins of Georgia over the weekend in representing the Republican Party, and myself, against the Impeachment Hoax!""
The governor began informing lawmakers about his decision over the weekend, according to the source.

An official announcement is expected on Wednesday, a source said. A spokesperson for Kemp's office declined to comment.

The anticipated selection of Loeffler, the co-founder and CEO of Bakkt and a co-owner and co-chair of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream team, was first reported by the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

The Atlanta businesswoman is set to fill longtime GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Senate seat, who is retiring at the end of 2019, in the new year. After serving for three terms, Isakson, 74, announced in August he was stepping down at the end of the year due to health issues.

Isakson is slated to deliver his farewell address on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

The temporary appointment will serve until a special election is held on Nov. 3, 2020, alongside Georgia's other Senate seat up for grabs in 2020.

In the lead-up to Kemp's expected announcement, hundreds of Georgians submitted applications to be considered to fill the soon-to-be open seat. Loeffler, a political outsider, submitted her application on Nov. 18, the last day to do so, in which she identified herself as a ""lifelong Republican,"" and said she'll ""stand with President Trump ... to Keep America Great.""
""Politicians with radical agendas threaten to undermine and destroy all that has made this country the shining beacon of liberty and opportunity in the world,"" she wrote in her letter submitting an application.
If Loeffler runs in the special election next year to finish out the remainder of Isakson’s term, she could help regain support among suburban female voters who have drifted from the GOP in recent cycles, in part, due to the president's brashness.
Between 2011 and 2012, Loeffler, along with her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, made huge contributions to Restore our Future, Inc., a super PAC backing then-Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. Loeffler donated $750,000 and Sprecher donated $780,000, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

More recently, in 2019, Loeffler and her husband each gave a $35,500 contribution per calendar year -- the maximum amount -- to the Republican National Committee, plus an additional $39,500 each to the RNC’s convention account, according to FEC filings.

House Judiciary debates wording of Trump impeachment charges: Live updates,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-judiciary-debates-wording-trump-impeachment-charges/story?id=67683400,"
After a late night of primetime speechmaking, members of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday are debating the specific language of the impeachment articles targeting President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

This is the second day of what's called a ""markup"" -- where members can propose changes to the wording of the articles -- but few if any amendments are likely to be approved by the Democratic majority on the committee.

In the first stage of the markup Wednesday night, Democrats continued to defend their handling and the pace of the impeachment proceedings while Republicans attacked them for pushing to remove Trump for what they said were political reasons.
Here is how the hearing is unfolding. Please refresh for updates.

Democrats have voted down the third Republican amendment.

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Penn., has introduced another amendment, the fourth of the day.

It would strike ""all of Article II.""

""The facts simply do not align,"" he said, in explaining the proposal to strike the obstruction charge, as some people in the hearing room groaned at the prospect of continued debate.

At points, debate has slowed down, with some members losing steam. But others are still in rare form: Just over an hour ago, Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, likened Republicans on the committee to Judas, and accused them of betraying their oaths of office as Judas betrayed Jesus Christ.

""Today, I'm reminded of Judas, because Judas for 30 pieces of silver betrayed Jesus. For 30 positive tweets, for easy re-election, the other side is willing to betray the American people their precious right to vote and the future of our great country,"" he said.Dem. Rep. Cedric Richmond: ""Judas, for 30 pieces of silver, betrayed Jesus.

For 30 positive tweets...the other side is willing to betray the American people, their precious right to vote and the future of our great country."" https://t.co/CCLfKM043a pic.twitter.com/8ObKEIw45y
Once again raising his voice at Democrats, Ranking Member Doug Collins makes the argument that Republicans have made central to their case today.

""My question is, where's your crimes?"" he asks. ""You talk about them, you want people to think they're there. You want people to come out and say, well, there's bribery, extortion, high-minded words. And you do it over and over and over again. The problem is, if you had it, you would have put articles on it. You don't have it so you didn't put articles on it. That's the stain on your articles. That's the stain on this committee.
""This committee couldn't make their case, so they came up with abuse of power. So they could put anything in it, and today we've heard that over and over and over again. Why? Because at the end of the day, the aid was delivered. Nothing was held,"" he says.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders in the hearing room reports: Republicans offer a third amendment -- this one from Rep. Andy Biggs --  is about the military aid to Ukraine eventually being released. (That happened after Trump and the White House learned of the whistleblower complaint about the July 25 call.)

Biggs wants to add the following language: ""The aid was released within days of Ukrainian President Zelenskiy signing two major anti-corruption measures into law, convincing President Trump that the new Ukrainian administration was serious about reform measures, and consistent with Administration policy to ensure foreign aid is not used for corrupt purposes.""
A second GOP amendment that would have removed a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden and inserted language about the Ukrainian Energy company Burisma and Hunter Biden fails on a party-line vote.

Nadler responds strongly to Republicans arguing against the obstruction of justice article, saying ""there are two basic protections we have for our democracy"" -- the first being ""free and fair elections.""

""And the president in Article 1 is charged with trying to subvert the free and fair elections by extorting a foreign power into interfering in that election, to give him help in his campaign. We cannot tolerate a president subverting the fairness and integrity of our elections. The second major safeguard of our liberties designed by the framers of the Constitution, is the separation of powers.

""The second article of impeachment charges that the president sought and seeks to destroy the power of Congress,"" Nadler continues.

""Congress may be unpopular and maybe we should be re-elected or maybe we shouldn't be re-elected, that's a question for the voters. But the institutional power of Congress to safeguard our liberties by providing a check and a balance on the executive is crucial to the constitutional scheme to protect our liberties. Second to that is the ability to investigate the actions of the executive branch, to see what's going on, and to hold the executive, the president, or people working for him, accountable. The second article of impeachment says that the president sought to destroy that by categorically with holding all information from an impeachment inquiry. That is different from contesting some subpoenas on the basis of privilege, some may be contestable, some may not be."" he says.

""Whether you think Congress is behaving well or badly, if you want a dictator, then you subvert the ability of Congress to hold the executive in check. What is central here is do we want a dictator, no matter how popular he may be, no matter how good or bad the results of his policies may be, no president is supposed to be a dictator in the United States. When I hear colleagues of mine arguing that Congress is unpopular and therefore obstruction of Congress is a good thing, this shows terrible ignorance or lack of care for our institutions, for our democracy, for our form of government, for our liberties. I, for one, will protect our liberties, will do everything I can to protect our liberties, our democracy, our free and fair elections, and the separation of powers that says Congress and the president and the judiciary check each other and nobody can be a dictator. I yield back,"" he says.
Chairman Nadler gavels the hearing back into session.

Nadler calls a recess so members can go vote.

It's expected that will take about an hour.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz proposes an amendment that would remove a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic rival of the president in the 2020 election, and replace it with a reference to his son Hunter Biden and his work on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The language of the amendment describes both the company and its decision to hire Hunter Biden as ""corrupt.""
The first article of impeachment accuses Trump of abuse of power for requests the Ukrainian government investigate Joe Biden and a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election despite unanimous findings from the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election. It does not specifically mention Hunter Biden or Burisma.

Democrats have said allegations of wrongdoing against the Bidens are not credible and officials have said they found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, despite a possible appearance of a conflict of interest.
GOP Rep. Jim Jordan's amendment to strike the abuse of power charge against Trump is defeated 23-17.

Before calling a vote on Jordan's proposed amendment, Chairman Jerry Nadler says: ""The United States is a powerful nation on which his nation is dependent. He has a gun to his head. The gun is the fact that the president of the United States, upon whom he depends for military aid, for help in many different ways, has shown himself willing to withhold that aid and to do other things based on what he says, based on what he says, based on whether he's willing to play along with the president for his personal, political goals, so of course he denies he was pressured.

""If he didn't deny that, there might be heavy consequences to pay, and you cannot credit that denial without any aspersions on his character, but simply on the fact that the president of the United States holds a gun to his head,"" Nadler says.
Ranking member Doug Collins argues Democrats keep saying Trump asked Ukraine's president to do ""me a favor.""

""Quit saying, 'I want you to do me a favor.' It's not in the transcript. It must be hard to read. I guess ""me"" and ""us"" gets confused when you're trying to make up facts. That's what's happening here.""

""The moment I saw that they decided to use abuse of power, what they did is they gave their whole conference (all House Democrats) carte blanche to make up anything they want and call it abuse of power because they don't have anything else to give.""

After Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Veronica Escobar, both of Texas, each forget the word ""us"" when reading the transcript of the president's call, Trump responds with a tweet, repeating his claim that by ""us"" he meant the United States, not himself.

""Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.""Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.— Donald J.

   Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.
Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., responds to the GOP defense that Trump never used the word ""demand"" in his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine, providing her own hypothetical for why, she says, that defense fails.

""When a robber points a gun at you to take your money, they usually don't walk up and say I'm robbing you right now,"" she says. ""We can talk about alternative facts all day long but the facts are really pretty clear -- that the president abused his power, the precious power of his office to coerce a country that was dependent on us. A country who's fighting Russian aggression because when Ukraine fights Russian aggression, they're helping us fight Russian aggression. And he did it for personal gain. He should be held accountable,"" she argues.
To be recognized by the chair, each member moves to ""strike the last word"" of the pending amendment, language used to help keep proper parliamentary order.

Republicans continue to argue that the articles don't accuse the president of committing any crimes and Democrats haven't proven that be broke the law.

They say the allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice don't meet the constitutional requirement of ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Democrats argue the president doesn't have to commit a crime to abuse his office.

Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, argues that abuse of power wasn't one of the articles of impeachment against Presidents Bill Clinton or Richard Nixon.

""The facts speak for themselves. There was no impeachable offense here and that's why Article 1 of the impeachment ended up falling flat on its face and that it should be stricken,"" Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., referring to his Democratic colleagues, says, ""I hear them, you know, crying these alligator tears, clutching their pearls, over this notion that 'Trump didn't give this aid. We gotta go impeach him for it.' Where was all this concern when Obama was president?""

After several Republican note that no specific crimes such as bribery are alleged in the articles, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, asks rhetorically: ""There are no crimes here? That is the defense my colleagues across the aisle are putting forward?

""How about the highest crime that one who holds public office could commit, a crime against our Constitution. After all, the Constitution is the highest, most supreme law of the land. Every other law, statutory laws included, derive from the Constitution, not the other way around. The president committed the highest crime against the Constitution by abusing his office, cheating in an election, inviting foreign interference for a purely personal gain while jeopardizing our national security and the integrity of our elections,"" Swalwell says.
""Since my colleagues keep bringing up what potential crimes you could charge a president with, let's go through some of them because President Trump's conduct overlaps with criminal acts,""

Republicans criticized the impeachment articles, saying they don't accuse the president of committing any crimes and that Democrats haven't proven that be broke the law. They say the allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice don't meet the constitutional requirement of ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" though Democrats argue the president doesn't have to commit a crime to abuse his office.

Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz, joins Collins' criticism of Nadler for refusing to hold a minority hearing day before the Judiciary Committee holds a vote Thursday evening.

""All we heard from was a bunch of liberal law professors that you called here that have a known record of disliking President Trump,"" she says.
GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio proposes an amendment to strike the first article that states the president abused his power in his actions toward Ukraine and asking for the investigation of his political rivals.

Jordan argued the evidence doesn't show a 'quid pro quo' between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy in the July 25 call, pointing out that both Trump and Zelenskiy have said there was no agreement that military aid to Ukraine would be conditioned on the announcement of an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election.

""This strikes Article 1 because Article 1 ignores the truth. Four facts, five meetings. We've known there have been four facts that have not changed, will not change, will never change and we've known it since September 25th when the call transcript was released,"" Jordan says. ""It shows no quid pro quo. What's interesting is the day the transcript came out, even chairman Nadler said there was no quid pro quo in the transcript,"" Jordan said.

""Article 1 in this resolution ignores the truth, the facts. It ignores what happened and what has been laid out for the American people over the last three weeks. So I hope that this committee will come to its senses, that it will adopt the amendment and strike article 1 from the resolution,"" Jordan says,
Democratic Rep, David Cicilline of Rhode Island responds by saying the evidence is ""overwhelming"" and clear that the quid pro quo happened, reading from previous witness testimony and texts exchanged between American diplomats.
""So, this claim that this is the thinnest of evidence is simply not true. There is overwhelming evidence of the scheme led by the president, led by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to corrupt the American elections to continue to withhold military aid until such time as a public announcement was made that would sphere the president's chief political rival,"" Cicilline says.

Trump held up military aid over concerns about Ukrainian corruption ""laughable."" https://t.co/CCLfKMhFrK pic.twitter.com/huVIV50QEI— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 12, 2019

Giuliani in Ukraine with conservative outlet in effort to discredit impeachment probe,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-impeachment-marches-forward-washington/story?id=67519317,"
As impeachment drama marches forward in Washington, D.C., focusing on a call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani traveled to Kyiv.

The president's personal attorney is meeting with current and former Ukrainian officials who have served as key sources for his questionable theories about Ukrainian corruption and election meddling as part of a documentary series by far-right network One America News Network (OAN) that is intended to discredit the impeachment process.

OAN previously confirmed to ABC News that Giuliani is in Europe conducting interviews as part of their investigative documentary series, which seeks to debunk what it describes as ""the impeachment hoax"" and offer proof of Ukrainian corruption and 2016 election meddling, according to a spokesperson for the network.
Among those with whom Giuliani has met is pro-Russian Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach, a former member of the Party of Regions, the political party of Ukraine's toppled pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. In recent weeks, Derkach has held a series of press conferences pushing unsupported theories attacking ousted U.S. Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch and leveling allegations without proof that Hunter Biden received corrupt payments. At the press conferences, Derkach has presented dubious documents that he has also frequently misrepresented.

Derkach posted photos Thursday with Giuliani in Kyiv, and according to Derkach, the two discussed creating an anti-corruption group in Ukraine's parliament to investigate alleged misuse of American taxpayer money in Ukraine.

""Rudolf Giuliani landed in Kyiv. We straightway met with him about the question of creating an inter-parliamentary group 'Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption,'"" Derkach wrote in a length post on Facebook. ""Unfortunately our country finds itself in the center of scandals relating to international corruption.""
Derkach added that he believed Giuliani's participation in creating the anti-corruption group would be ""very useful for us. In particular, he can help with including in this group international experts, analysts, journalists and all those who are able to realise the tasks of the group and to benefit the strategic relations between Ukraine and the U.S.""

Allegations put forth by Giuliani -- including a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election and accusations of malpractice by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden -- helped formed the contours of an impeachment report issued this week by the House Intelligence Committee.
In addition to his meeting with Derkach, Giuliani met with former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko as part of the project, according to a spokesperson for Lutsenko. Removed from his post as the country's top law enforcement official earlier this year, Lutsenko has been one of Giuliani's key sources of information about Ukraine.

Giuliani's quest to concoct damaging narratives in Ukraine eventually played a major role in triggering the impeachment process, after Trump sought to push Ukraine's leadership into announcing investigations into the conspiracies.

In a previous episode of the OAN series that aired within the last few weeks, Giuliani said Trump had blessed his efforts in Ukraine, even as the White House continues to face scrutiny for holding up military aid to Kyiv in exchange for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's support of politically beneficial investigations, including one targeting a prospective 2020 rival, Joe Biden.

""The president of the United States, I can tell you this, is asking for this,"" Giuliani told OAN.
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C, Democrats are moving swiftly in the impeachment of Trump. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday morning, within hours of news breaking that Giuliani had traveled to Ukraine, that she would ask relevant committee chairmen to begin drafting articles of impeachment.

""The facts are uncontested,"" Pelosi said. ""The president abused his power for his own political benefit.""
Democrats in Congress issued a subpoena to Giuliani for documents and communication records related to his work in Ukraine. Giuliani has thus far refused to cooperate or provide the records. He is also the subject of an investigation in the Southern District of New York for his contacts with two Soviet-born associates with ties to Ukraine, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, sources have told ABC News.

Giuliani's work on matters related to Ukraine and his business dealings with two Soviet-born associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, is the subject of an on going investigation by prosecutors out of the Southern District of New York, sources have previously told ABC News.

As ABC News has previously reported, the House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Parnas. "
"As impeachment rolls on, accountability will likely be with voters: Opinion",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-rolls-accountability-voters-hands-opinion/story?id=67518184,"
As I and millions of Americans have tuned into the impeachment hearings over the last month, and now that we have the first hearing of the House Judiciary Committee behind us, let us ask a fundamental question: has the political dynamic in Washington fundamentally changed regarding how President Trump will be held accountable?

As I wrote just before the first hearings began, I did not expect public opinion to be fundamentally moved by the hearings either for or against impeachment. And lo and behold public opinion has not statistically changed. A plurality remains supportive of impeaching and removing the president, and a sizable segment remains opposed.
Though Democrats have built a rather clear and convincing case for impeachment, Republicans in Washington and GOP voters around the country appear to remain unmoved. It looks like, as I surmised a month ago, the main outcome of the hearings is that Democrats are increasingly solidified in their desire for impeachment, and Republicans are even more solidly opposed. We are in such an era of polarization and tribalism that it is extremely hard to move public opinion even when the facts and the law all seem lined up consistently in one direction.

What is likely to come next?  It appears that the House Judiciary Committee will soon draw up multiple articles of impeachment and pass them out of committee without any Republican support. The articles will then move quickly to the House floor where Democrats also appear to have to the votes to impeach the President and send the matter to the Senate. And because Republicans hold a majority in the Senate (and convicting the president requires two-thirds approval), it seems nearly impossible for that to happen.

If there are enough Republicans who want to hold the president accountable, a compromise may be reached. Instead of impeaching the president, we may see a move towards censure, which signals disapproval but does not involve the process of trying and potentially removing Trump from office. Still, we have no formal indications this is happening.
All of this points to a fundamental political principle in our democracy and its history over more than 200 years: when there is serious political division and leaders need to be held accountable, a legislative action like impeachment is hardly ever the solution to our ills. Many legislative compromises and actions were taken in the run-up to the Civil War and none worked in cooling tempers and unifying the country. Unfortunately it took a bitter fight and a series of elections to resolve the disputes.

My guess is that regardless of the outcome of this impeachment effort, to settle our divisions and the direction of our country, it is going to take the 2020 elections (and then maybe a few more) before we move to a more unified and enlightened place.  It will be up to the voters to finally hold our leaders accountable and not lawmakers. While that may not be satisfying to some, it does seem an integral part of American history.

"Trump says Pompeo, Mulvaney could testify in a Senate impeachment trial",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-pompeo-mulvaney-testify-senate-impeachment-trial/story?id=67463857,"
A day before the next public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into how he and his administration handled military aid to Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he could direct top administration officials to testify in a possible Senate trial.

The White House has blocked administration officials from cooperating with the House impeachment effort. Asked why he has blocked them from appearing as Democrats have repeatedly requested
Trump said he would like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry to testify but once again claimed the House proceedings are ""unfair.""

“It will be fair in the Senate,” the president said during a photo op with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the NATO summit in London., a reference to the fact that Republicans will have greater control of the process in the Senate, where they have a majority.

“I would love to have Mike Pompeo and Mick and I would love to have Rick Perry, and many other people testify. But I don't want them to testify when this is a total fix. You know what a fix is? It's a fix. Just think of it,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing process in the House of Representatives.
While the president is now drawing a distinction that he’d be willing allow these individuals to testify in the Senate, he has previously argued that he is fighting for the presidency in refusing compliance, warning that “future presidents should in no way be compromised.”

Trump said he would not send his own lawyers to participate in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, calling it a ""hoax.""

Trump has previously made comments about allowing high-ranking officials to testify or answer questions but has not taken any steps to make that happen.
Trump also used some of his strongest language yet in attacking the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, calling him ""deranged"" and a ""maniac,"" accusing him of twisting his words when Schiff read an interpretation of the transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy.

The president predicted that the ratings will be bad for Wednesday's first impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.

“Tomorrow, I don't think anybody is going to watch. I won't watch, I'll be doing this, it is much more exciting,” Trump said.

The president said Republicans would want former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to testify.

But when asked by a reporter what he thinks he can learn from Schiff, the president said “I learn nothing from Adam Schiff” and launched into a tirade against the Democrat, who has had a leading role in the impeachment process.

""I learned nothing from Adam Schiff. I think he is a maniac. Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he is a very sick man. And he lies. Adam Schiff made up my conversation with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""And one of the reasons people keep talking about it is that's what they saw.""

The president also claimed, as he has before, that the impeachment battle is helping him politically, saying we are “winning so big” and falsely claiming his poll numbers have never been better."
DOJ watchdog finds Russia probe not improper,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-watchdog-finds-russia-investigation-improper-missteps/story?id=67599147,"
A major Department of Justice inspector general report released Monday has determined the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election was launched with an authorized purpose, despite significant allegations of wrongdoing in how agents handled the counterintelligence probe of President Donald Trump's campaign.

Following the release of the report on Monday, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General William Barr gave conflicting responses to the findings from the report.
""I think it's important that the Inspector General found that in this particular instance the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization,"" Wray told ABC News in an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday.FBI Director Chris Wray: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivations impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, ""or the decision to use certain investigative tools.""@PierreTABC: ""Including FISA?""Wray: ""Including FISA."" https://t.co/FHRCvkSK8q pic.twitter.com/yYPwBydIFy— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 FBI Director Chris Wray: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivations impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, ""or the decision to use certain investigative tools.""@PierreTABC: ""Including FISA?""Wray: ""Including FISA."" https://t.co/FHRCvkSK8q pic.twitter.com/yYPwBydIFy
Inspector General Michael Horowitz's office found the Russia investigation was launched in July 2016 based on suspicions shared with the U.S. about former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, and that it ""was sufficient to predicate the investigation.""

""This information provided the FBI with an articulable factual basis that, if true, reasonably indicated activity constituting either a federal crime or a threat to national security, or both, may have occurred or may be occurring,"" the report said.

You can read the full report here.
Barr, in a statement reacting to the report's release, stated that he believed the evidence compiled by Horowitz showed that the FBI ""launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken.""
""It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory,"" Barr said. ""Nevertheless, the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump's administration.""""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Pres.

Trump says of IG report findings.The report found the Russia investigation was launched with proper cause, despite missteps in how agents handled the probe. https://t.co/rDpNuZpUTv pic.twitter.com/gqKEQwNk9s
Trump called the report's findings ""an embarrassment"" and ""dishonest"" and said it was ""a very sad day.""

""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday afternoon. ""It should never again happen to another president.""
In a follow-up statement, Barr noted that he was ""grateful"" to the foreign government that had initially provided the FBI with the information on Papadopoulos -- while noting, ""what was subsequently done with that information by the FBI presents a separate question.""

U.S. Attorney John H. Durham too responded in a statement that ""we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened."" He added that ""our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department"" and also included ""developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.""

Horowitz also determined that the controversial ""dossier"" authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was not relied upon in opening the investigation.

According to the report, Horowitz found that DOJ had an authorized purpose in investigating whether there was a crime, and noted the ""low threshold"" for opening such an investigation. He also noted that while former FBI lawyer Peter Strzok was involved in the decision to open the investigation, the actual authorization came from his supervisor Bill Priestap, the former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division.
Horowitz said the office ""did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced (Priestap's) decision.""

However, Horowitz in his year-and-a-half long investigation uncovered ""serious performance failures"" on the part of agents involved in the FISA applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, according to the report.BREAKING: FBI Dir. Chris Wray to @PierreTABC: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivation impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, but ""did find a number of instances where employees ... failed to follow our policies."" https://t.co/iYA592qfam pic.twitter.com/qzdtTeN098— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 BREAKING: FBI Dir.

While Horowitz found no evidence of political bias or improper motivation for the FISA applications for Page, he documented what he described as serious errors and omissions that ""made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.""

The IG documented a total of ""seven significant inaccuracies and omissions"" in the initial FISA application for surveillance on Page, and ""10 additional significant errors in the three renewal applications,"" and said none of the issues were brought to the attention of the Office of Intelligence until the final application was filed in June 2017.

According to the report, the FBI failed to reassess the reliability of Steele's reporting while relying heavily on the material for FISA applications despite obtaining information that raised significant questions about it. However, the IG noted that just because the FBI believed Steele had been hired by Democrat-tied firm Fusion GPS to conduct political opposition research did not require the agency ""under either DOJ or FBI policy, to ignore his reporting.""

Horowitz said the errors ""raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command's management and supervision of the FISA process."".@jonkarl on DOJ inspector general report on origins of Russia probe: ""In this report, there's absolutely nothing"" to corroborate Pres. Trump's allegations.

Trump's allegations. ""In fact, it directly contradicts those charges."" https://t.co/3lWdFByhuM pic.twitter.com/oQJtfVsUkw
The inspector general also found that the FBI used a confidential human source to approach a ""high-level"" official on the Trump campaign in September of 2016 who was not the subject of investigation, but the source's interactions with the official gleaned nothing of value.

Horowitz did not back Trump's assertions that the FBI planted agents within his campaign, and found agents ""received the necessary FBI approvals"" and that there's no evidence political bias affected the use of confidential sources against Page -- Papadopoulos and the unidentified Trump campaign official. But he also stated that current policies should be updated to reflect investigations of political campaigns.

""We believe that current Department and FBI policies are not sufficient to ensure appropriate oversight and accountability when such operations potentially implicate sensitive, constitutionally protected activity, and that they should require, at minimum, Department consultation,"" the report says.

Since last year, Republicans have zeroed in on DOJ official Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie Ohr had previously worked for Fusion GPS, as part of their mounting line of attacks against the Russia probe.

However, the IG report concluded that Ohr wasn't required to get ethics department approval for his work regarding the Russia investigation, though it added:  ""given the factual circumstances that existed, and the appearance that they created, Ohr displayed a lapse in judgment by not availing himself"" of the DOJ's ethics consultation process.

Prior to its public release, the report was transmitted to Congress where lawmakers and aides reviewed it with staff from Horowitz's office, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. Horowitz is set to testify on the report's findings on Wednesday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

DOJ watchdog defends Russia investigation report against AG Barr's criticism,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-watchdog-set-testify-report-scrutinized-fbis-russia/story?id=67652921,"
Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Wednesday faced tough questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the Senate Judiciary Committee about his nearly 500-page report examining the origins of the Russia investigation.

In his opening statement, Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in remarks directed at Horowitz, lambasted the FBI's handling of the probe.
""You were able to uncover and discover abuse of power I never believed would actually exist in 2019,"" Graham said. ""How bad is it? It was as if J. Edgar Hoover came back to life. The old FBI that had a chip on its shoulder and wanted to intimidate people and find out what was going on in your life and the law be damned.""

""It was Trump today, it could be you or me tomorrow,"" Graham warned.

""Whether you like Trump, hate Trump, don't care about Trump, you look at this as more than a few irregularities. Because if this becomes a 'few irregularities' in America, then God help us all.""

Horowitz's report, released Monday, determined the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election was launched with an authorized purpose, despite significant allegations of wrongdoing in how agents handled the counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign.
Horowitz also told the committee no confidential human sources were placed inside of the Trump campaign, and that he found no evidence the FBI 'wiretapped' Trump either before or after the 2016 election.

""We did not find any documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to conduct these operations [involving confidential human sources]. Additionally, we found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any CHSs (confidential human sources) within the Trump campaign, recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHSs, or task CHSs to report on the Trump campaign,"" he said.

Asked about Attorney General William Barr's recent statements splitting from Horowitz's finding that the investigation into the Trump campaign had an adequate predicate, Horowitz responded, ""we stand by our findings.""

However, Horowitz acknowledged that the FBI didn't do all it could to ""meet the basic obligation to ensure that the (former Trump campaign adviser) Carter Page FISA applications were 'scrupulously accurate.'""

""We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams, on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations, after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI; even though the information sought through use of FISA authority related so closely to an ongoing presidential campaign; and even though those involved with the investigation knew that their actions were likely to be subjected to close scrutiny,"" he testified.

Horowitz said he was deeply troubled by the altering of a document used in the FISA process, as detailed in the report.

""I have not seen an alteration of an email impacting a court document like this,"" Horowitz told Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. But he wouldn't agree that the report shows a ""grotesque abuse of power,"" as Cruz alleged earlier.

""We did not reach a conclusion like that. So, I wouldn't agree with that at this point. From my standpoint, people can have that viewpoint. But that was not our conclusion,"" he said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the IG report ""conclusively refutes"" claims of political motivation by President Donald Trump and strong suggestions of that from Barr.

""There is no 'Deep State.' Simply put, the FBI investigation was motivated by facts, not bias,"" Feinstein said.

Horowitz also said that he did not find any evidence that the FBI tried to ""overthrow"" the president as he has claimed and did not tap the phones at Trump Tower.
Horowitz also said he was ""surprised"" by a statement from U.S. Attorney John Durham on Monday taking issue with his findings. Durham is conducting a broader investigation into how the Russia investigation began. Horowitz said Durham told him in November that he ""didn't necessarily agree"" that there was justification to open a full counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.

Durham also told him, Horowitz testified, that the information used to support the preliminary investigation opened by the FBI was ""sufficient.""

In a statement released Monday, Durham said he had ""advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened."" But the statement made no mention of his support for the opening of the preliminary investigation, as Horowitz claimed.

A spokesperson for Durham told ABC News he has ""no comment"" on Horowitz's characterization of their November conversation.

Elsewhere in his testimony, Horowitz also revealed his office still had an ongoing investigation into contacts Trump's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had  with the New York FBI field office and whether agents may have improperly leaked information to Giuliani or other journalists about the Clinton email investigation before the 2016 election.

""We are looking at still that question,"" Horowitz said in response to Sen. Dick Durbin D-Ill. ""Our investigation is ongoing.""

Earlier, in an interview with ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday,  Grahamsaid that he ""really believes"" that the FBI wanted to ""bring down the president.""

""It doesn't matter why they did it. I want people to understand that cops can't cheat. Cops can't lie. They have to play by the rules, even if you don't like Trump you should play by the rules because it could be you next time, not Trump,"" Graham continued.
Similar statements, were echoed by Barr on Tuesday, in a stunning interview where he blasted the Russia investigation as a ""travesty"" and that Horowitz's findings left open the possibility for ""bad faith"" on the part of FBI agents involved.
""From a civil liberties standpoint, the greatest danger to our free system is that the incumbent government used the apparatus of the state, principally the law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies, both to spy on political opponents, but also to use them in a way that could affect the outcome of the election,"" Barr said in an interview with NBC News.
FBI Director Christopher Wray, in an exclusive broadcast interview Monday with ABC News, lamented ""actions described in this report that [he] considered unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution.""
But, he said it was ""important that the inspector general found that, in this particular instance, the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization.""

At least one Democrat on the committee blasted Barr's theories.

“This report shows there was a proper predicate for the FBI to investigate Russia’s malign influence on the 2016 election and contacts with the Trump campaign.  That puts to rest President Trump’s accusations of a deep state conspiracy, and no amount of spin from Attorney General Barr, the White House, or congressional Republicans can change that.  Barr’s decision to question the report in the media says a lot about Attorney General Barr,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said in a statement on Monday.

“The Inspector General is an important defender against political influence over law enforcement—a regrettable tendency under Attorney General Barr.  I hope the Inspector General turns his attention to other allegations of politically motivated investigations by this administration.”

Craft, a longtime GOP activist from Kentucky, who along with her husband is a major donor to Trump and other Republicans, was the U.S. ambassador to Canada before being confirmed U.N. ambassador in a 56-34 vote in July, but not before several lawmakers questioned her experience.
On Friday, she outlined the council's schedule for December -- from meetings on Afghanistan, Yemen and South Sudan to inviting members on a first-of-its-kind overnight retreat in Kentucky. But one item she said the U.S. has not yet decided on is whether to hold a council meeting on Dec. 10 to specifically address human rights abuses in North Korea.

""I care about human rights around the world,"" Craft said, fielding several questions on North Korea. ""I can promise you that the council is very unified in the fact that we are all very concerned. It doesn't matter whether it's Christmas or it's tomorrow or it's February.""

Craft's remarks come ahead of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un's end-of-the-year deadline to President Donald Trump to show more flexibility in nuclear talks -- or else it will end all diplomacy -- and on the heels of several warnings by North Korean officials directed at the U.S. this week.

On Wednesday, North Korea’s U.N. ambassador Kim Song warned the council in a letter that a discussion of the country’s human rights situation would be a ""serious provocation"" and Pyongyang would ""respond strongly.""

""I have read the letter. We care about human rights,"" Craft responded,  ""None of us can stand by and allow human rights to be abused.""

At least eight members of the 15-member council support a meeting on North Korea -- but Craft emphasized that the council does stand united in its concern over the country's ballistic missile program.
Craft also stressed U.S. support for the council's mission to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria as opposed to a military one. The council has scheduled meetings on Dec. 19 and 20, the final day of the U.S. presidency, devoted to Syria.

""Over the next 12 months, the council's best efforts should be directed toward keeping the entry points through which the humanitarian agencies is delivered. This is essential to creating peace for the people in Syria,"" said Craft, referring to a U.N.-mandated cross-border aid delivery scheme operating from Turkey which is set to expire in January. ""There is no Plan B, so this has to happen. There is no alternative.""
When asked about reports of Turkey engaging in ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in Syria, Craft avoided criticizing the Turkish intervention. Instead, she thanked Turkey for opening a new fifth crossing to deliver humanitarian aid to the Syrian people and repeated that her primary concern is with people of Syria.

""We support Turkey adding the fifth border,"" she said. ""That is very important in order to access the growing number of humanitarian needs.""

Regarding Iran, Craft said that the country's problems of instability are due to the actions of oppressive leadership and blamed the government for supplying weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen. 
Subsequently, she said the U.S. will continue its maximum pressure campaign on Iran and hold a session on Dec. 19 related to its non-proliferation and the implementation of Resolution 2231.

""Iran has not changed its behavior, as it is interfering in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. What concerns me is the well-being of the Iranian people and the rejection of the Iranian state’s actions to offend its people and the peoples of the region,"" she said. ""I confirm that we have many means and we will use these means with Iran.""
And in a first for the council, Craft confirmed she will host members in her home state of Kentucky next weekend. Activities on their agenda include dining at the governor’s mansion, attending a University of Kentucky basketball game and bottling bourbon.

Craft echoed the sentiments of her boss when asked about the potential for the U.S. to help cover outstanding debts of other nations.

""Whether it be NATO paying their two percent or whether it be the U.N. burden sharing, we are the number one donor, the number one contributor both to the NATO and the U.N., she said. ""We expect countries to pay their fair share.""

She also said Israel has ""no better friend that Kelly Craft"" and vowed to continue the efforts of Trump's first ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, by fighting against anti-Israel resolutions.

""I'm not going to accept the status quo where Israel is the subject or relentless and one-sided criticism,"" she added on Friday. ""That is not okay with me.""

One of the first events under Craft's Security Council presidency was a group visit to the White House and working lunch with Trump on Thursday.

Craft said she promised their work would conclude by Dec. 20, so they can all can return home for the holidays.

House Judiciary debates articles: Live updates,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-judiciary-debates-wording-trump-impeachment-charges/story?id=67683400,"
After a late night of primetime speechmaking, members of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday are debating the specific language of the impeachment articles targeting President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

This is the second day of what's called a ""markup"" -- where members can propose changes to the wording of the articles -- but few if any amendments are likely to be approved by the Democratic majority on the committee.

In the first stage of the markup Wednesday night, Democrats continued to defend their handling and the pace of the impeachment proceedings while Republicans attacked them for pushing to remove Trump for what they said were political reasons.
Here is how the hearing is unfolding. Please refresh for updates.

Democrats have voted down the third Republican amendment.

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Penn., has introduced another amendment, the fourth of the day.

It would strike ""all of Article II.""

""The facts simply do not align,"" he said, in explaining the proposal to strike the obstruction charge, as some people in the hearing room groaned at the prospect of continued debate.

At points, debate has slowed down, with some members losing steam. But others are still in rare form: Just over an hour ago, Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, likened Republicans on the committee to Judas, and accused them of betraying their oaths of office as Judas betrayed Jesus Christ.

""Today, I'm reminded of Judas, because Judas for 30 pieces of silver betrayed Jesus. For 30 positive tweets, for easy re-election, the other side is willing to betray the American people their precious right to vote and the future of our great country,"" he said.Dem. Rep.

Rep. Cedric Richmond: ""Judas, for 30 pieces of silver, betrayed Jesus. For 30 positive tweets...the other side is willing to betray the American people, their precious right to vote and the future of our great country."" https://t.co/CCLfKM043a pic.twitter.com/8ObKEIw45y
Once again raising his voice at Democrats, Ranking Member Doug Collins makes the argument that Republicans have made central to their case today.

""My question is, where's your crimes?"" he asks. ""You talk about them, you want people to think they're there. You want people to come out and say, well, there's bribery, extortion, high-minded words. And you do it over and over and over again. The problem is, if you had it, you would have put articles on it. You don't have it so you didn't put articles on it. That's the stain on your articles. That's the stain on this committee.
""This committee couldn't make their case, so they came up with abuse of power. So they could put anything in it, and today we've heard that over and over and over again. Why? Because at the end of the day, the aid was delivered. Nothing was held,"" he says.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders in the hearing room reports: Republicans offer a third amendment -- this one from Rep. Andy Biggs --  is about the military aid to Ukraine eventually being released. (That happened after Trump and the White House learned of the whistleblower complaint about the July 25 call.)

Biggs wants to add the following language: ""The aid was released within days of Ukrainian President Zelenskiy signing two major anti-corruption measures into law, convincing President Trump that the new Ukrainian administration was serious about reform measures, and consistent with Administration policy to ensure foreign aid is not used for corrupt purposes.""
A second GOP amendment that would have removed a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden and inserted language about the Ukrainian Energy company Burisma and Hunter Biden fails on a party-line vote.

Nadler responds strongly to Republicans arguing against the obstruction of justice article, saying ""there are two basic protections we have for our democracy"" -- the first being ""free and fair elections.""

""And the president in Article 1 is charged with trying to subvert the free and fair elections by extorting a foreign power into interfering in that election, to give him help in his campaign. We cannot tolerate a president subverting the fairness and integrity of our elections. The second major safeguard of our liberties designed by the framers of the Constitution, is the separation of powers.

""The second article of impeachment charges that the president sought and seeks to destroy the power of Congress,"" Nadler continues.

""Congress may be unpopular and maybe we should be re-elected or maybe we shouldn't be re-elected, that's a question for the voters. But the institutional power of Congress to safeguard our liberties by providing a check and a balance on the executive is crucial to the constitutional scheme to protect our liberties. Second to that is the ability to investigate the actions of the executive branch, to see what's going on, and to hold the executive, the president, or people working for him, accountable. The second article of impeachment says that the president sought to destroy that by categorically with holding all information from an impeachment inquiry. That is different from contesting some subpoenas on the basis of privilege, some may be contestable, some may not be."" he says.

""Whether you think Congress is behaving well or badly, if you want a dictator, then you subvert the ability of Congress to hold the executive in check. What is central here is do we want a dictator, no matter how popular he may be, no matter how good or bad the results of his policies may be, no president is supposed to be a dictator in the United States. When I hear colleagues of mine arguing that Congress is unpopular and therefore obstruction of Congress is a good thing, this shows terrible ignorance or lack of care for our institutions, for our democracy, for our form of government, for our liberties. I, for one, will protect our liberties, will do everything I can to protect our liberties, our democracy, our free and fair elections, and the separation of powers that says Congress and the president and the judiciary check each other and nobody can be a dictator. I yield back,"" he says.
Chairman Nadler gavels the hearing back into session.

Nadler calls a recess so members can go vote.

It's expected that will take about an hour.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz proposes an amendment that would remove a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic rival of the president in the 2020 election, and replace it with a reference to his son Hunter Biden and his work on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The language of the amendment describes both the company and its decision to hire Hunter Biden as ""corrupt.""
The first article of impeachment accuses Trump of abuse of power for requests the Ukrainian government investigate Joe Biden and a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election despite unanimous findings from the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election. It does not specifically mention Hunter Biden or Burisma.

Democrats have said allegations of wrongdoing against the Bidens are not credible and officials have said they found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, despite a possible appearance of a conflict of interest.
GOP Rep. Jim Jordan's amendment to strike the abuse of power charge against Trump is defeated 23-17.

Before calling a vote on Jordan's proposed amendment, Chairman Jerry Nadler says: ""The United States is a powerful nation on which his nation is dependent. He has a gun to his head. The gun is the fact that the president of the United States, upon whom he depends for military aid, for help in many different ways, has shown himself willing to withhold that aid and to do other things based on what he says, based on what he says, based on whether he's willing to play along with the president for his personal, political goals, so of course he denies he was pressured.

""If he didn't deny that, there might be heavy consequences to pay, and you cannot credit that denial without any aspersions on his character, but simply on the fact that the president of the United States holds a gun to his head,"" Nadler says.
Ranking member Doug Collins argues Democrats keep saying Trump asked Ukraine's president to do ""me a favor.""

""Quit saying, 'I want you to do me a favor.' It's not in the transcript. It must be hard to read. I guess ""me"" and ""us"" gets confused when you're trying to make up facts. That's what's happening here.""

""The moment I saw that they decided to use abuse of power, what they did is they gave their whole conference (all House Democrats) carte blanche to make up anything they want and call it abuse of power because they don't have anything else to give.""

After Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Veronica Escobar, both of Texas, each forget the word ""us"" when reading the transcript of the president's call, Trump responds with a tweet, repeating his claim that by ""us"" he meant the United States, not himself.

""Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.""Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2019

   Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.
Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., responds to the GOP defense that Trump never used the word ""demand"" in his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine, providing her own hypothetical for why, she says, that defense fails.

""When a robber points a gun at you to take your money, they usually don't walk up and say I'm robbing you right now,"" she says. ""We can talk about alternative facts all day long but the facts are really pretty clear -- that the president abused his power, the precious power of his office to coerce a country that was dependent on us. A country who's fighting Russian aggression because when Ukraine fights Russian aggression, they're helping us fight Russian aggression. And he did it for personal gain. He should be held accountable,"" she argues.
To be recognized by the chair, each member moves to ""strike the last word"" of the pending amendment, language used to help keep proper parliamentary order.

Republicans continue to argue that the articles don't accuse the president of committing any crimes and Democrats haven't proven that be broke the law.

They say the allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice don't meet the constitutional requirement of ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Democrats argue the president doesn't have to commit a crime to abuse his office.

Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, argues that abuse of power wasn't one of the articles of impeachment against Presidents Bill Clinton or Richard Nixon.

""The facts speak for themselves. There was no impeachable offense here and that's why Article 1 of the impeachment ended up falling flat on its face and that it should be stricken,"" Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., referring to his Democratic colleagues, says, ""I hear them, you know, crying these alligator tears, clutching their pearls, over this notion that 'Trump didn't give this aid. We gotta go impeach him for it.' Where was all this concern when Obama was president?""

After several Republican note that no specific crimes such as bribery are alleged in the articles, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, asks rhetorically: ""There are no crimes here? That is the defense my colleagues across the aisle are putting forward?

""How about the highest crime that one who holds public office could commit, a crime against our Constitution. After all, the Constitution is the highest, most supreme law of the land. Every other law, statutory laws included, derive from the Constitution, not the other way around. The president committed the highest crime against the Constitution by abusing his office, cheating in an election, inviting foreign interference for a purely personal gain while jeopardizing our national security and the integrity of our elections,"" Swalwell says.
""Since my colleagues keep bringing up what potential crimes you could charge a president with, let's go through some of them because President Trump's conduct overlaps with criminal acts,""

Republicans criticized the impeachment articles, saying they don't accuse the president of committing any crimes and that Democrats haven't proven that be broke the law. They say the allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice don't meet the constitutional requirement of ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" though Democrats argue the president doesn't have to commit a crime to abuse his office.

Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz, joins Collins' criticism of Nadler for refusing to hold a minority hearing day before the Judiciary Committee holds a vote Thursday evening.

""All we heard from was a bunch of liberal law professors that you called here that have a known record of disliking President Trump,"" she says.
GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio proposes an amendment to strike the first article that states the president abused his power in his actions toward Ukraine and asking for the investigation of his political rivals.

Jordan argued the evidence doesn't show a 'quid pro quo' between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy in the July 25 call, pointing out that both Trump and Zelenskiy have said there was no agreement that military aid to Ukraine would be conditioned on the announcement of an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election.

""This strikes Article 1 because Article 1 ignores the truth. Four facts, five meetings. We've known there have been four facts that have not changed, will not change, will never change and we've known it since September 25th when the call transcript was released,"" Jordan says. ""It shows no quid pro quo. What's interesting is the day the transcript came out, even chairman Nadler said there was no quid pro quo in the transcript,"" Jordan said.

""Article 1 in this resolution ignores the truth, the facts. It ignores what happened and what has been laid out for the American people over the last three weeks. So I hope that this committee will come to its senses, that it will adopt the amendment and strike article 1 from the resolution,"" Jordan says,
Democratic Rep, David Cicilline of Rhode Island responds by saying the evidence is ""overwhelming"" and clear that the quid pro quo happened, reading from previous witness testimony and texts exchanged between American diplomats.
""So, this claim that this is the thinnest of evidence is simply not true. There is overwhelming evidence of the scheme led by the president, led by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to corrupt the American elections to continue to withhold military aid until such time as a public announcement was made that would sphere the president's chief political rival,"" Cicilline says. ""The president had two phone calls with Pres. Zelenskiy. He never once even uttered the word 'corruption.'""Dem. Rep. David Cicilline calls claim that Pres. Trump held up military aid over concerns about Ukrainian corruption ""laughable."" https://t.co/CCLfKMhFrK pic.twitter.com/huVIV50QEI— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 12, 2019

Within seconds of Chairman Jerry Nadler gaveling the hearing in, Ranking Member Doug Collins again calls for a ""minority hearing"" at which Republicans could present their own witnesses before the articles are debated.
ABC News' Katherine Faulders reports from the hearing room: Nadler ruled against Collins and after Collins appealed the ruling and after a vote, his motion was tabled -- or set aside.

Nadler offered the first amendment on the resolution to change the president's name in Article 1 from Donald J Trump to Donald John Trump.

Collins called the change irrelevant and absurd and continued to attack Democrats for moving too quickly and ""rubber stamping"" impeachment without listening to Republicans.

Courts block Trump administration plan to use military funds for border wall,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-plan-military-funds-border/story?id=67653805,"
Two federal courts in two days have issued nationwide orders blocking the Trump administration's use of $3.6 billion in military construction funds to build a wall along the border of the United States and Mexico, declaring that repurposing those funds would be ""unlawful.""

In one case, brought on by the American Civil Liberties Union, U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam ruled against the administration and indicated that the executive branch attempting to build the wall without Congressional approval was a notable factor in his decision.

""[The] border barrier projects [the Trump administration] now assert are 'necessary to support the use of the armed forces' are the very same projects [the administration] sought -- and failed -- to build under [Homeland Security's] civilian authority, because Congress would not appropriate the requested funds,"" Gilliam wrote in his ruling released Wednesday.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the administration would appeal the ruling, which she was said would unfairly block ""multiple projects that are hundreds of miles away and have nothing to do with these plaintiffs.""

""The Supreme Court,"" she added in a statement, ""has already stayed one erroneous injunction blocking the use of a different statutory authority to build the border wall and the Administration plans to immediately appeal this incorrect decision, too.""

Another decision came earlier this week after the government of El Paso County in Texas filed a lawsuit to stop the wall, arguing that the construction caused irreparable damage to their community. The ruling said the plaintiffs had indeed demonstrated ""irreparable harm"" and that the ""balance of the equities and public interest weigh in their favor.""
""It's a great victory for Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and a reminder that presidents are NOT kings,"" Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California said in a response on Twitter.BREAKING: A judge has blocked President Trump's attempt to spend crucial military construction funds on his ineffective border wall. It's a great victory for Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and a reminder that presidents are NOT kings. https://t.co/0O7lUs7W8P— Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (@RepRoybalAllard) December 11, 2019 BREAKING: A judge has blocked President Trump's attempt to spend crucial military construction funds on his ineffective border wall. It's a great victory for Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and a reminder that presidents are NOT kings. https://t.co/0O7lUs7W8P
The court orders block funding planned for as much as 175 miles for an ""emergency border wall system"" in Texas, Arizona and California -- disrupting the administration's plans to complete 450 miles of new barriers by the end of 2020.

Since President Donald Trump took office, the administration has built just over 86 miles of new barriers. Most of that work has been renovating and replacing outdated designs, according to Customs and Border Protection.
Federal authorities have not completed any new barriers along empty stretches of border, but CBP officials said construction is underway in the Rio Grande Valley.

Last July, the Supreme Court handed Trump a big win on the issue by greenlighting $2.5 billion to be used for military counter-drug funding for the border wall temporarily -- a signal that it would ultimately side with the administration on the issue of shifting money around for what Trump says is a ""national emergency.""
The judge in the latest ruling -- District Court Judge David Briones with the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas -- insists that his decision doesn't conflict with the Supreme Court decision, because his case focused on military construction funds, not counterdrug money.
""The president's emergency proclamation was a blatant attempt to grab power from Congress,"" said Kristy Parker, a lawyer for Protect Democracy, an advocacy group that provided legal representation in the case. ""This is a huge win for democracy and the rule of law,"" Parker added.

With an appeal from government lawyers, the case likely goes to the Supreme Court -- a path where it could linger while lawmakers head into a new fight over government funding in the coming weeks.

"DOJ watchdog finds Russia investigation not improper, despite missteps",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-watchdog-finds-russia-investigation-improper-missteps/story?id=67599147,"
A major Department of Justice inspector general report released Monday has determined the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election was launched with an authorized purpose, despite significant allegations of wrongdoing in how agents handled the counterintelligence probe of President Donald Trump's campaign.

Following the release of the report on Monday, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General William Barr gave conflicting responses to the findings from the report.
""I think it's important that the Inspector General found that in this particular instance the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization,"" Wray told ABC News in an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday.FBI Director Chris Wray: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivations impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, ""or the decision to use certain investigative tools.""@PierreTABC: ""Including FISA?""Wray: ""Including FISA."" https://t.co/FHRCvkSK8q pic.twitter.com/yYPwBydIFy— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 FBI Director Chris Wray: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivations impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, ""or the decision to use certain investigative tools.""@PierreTABC: ""Including FISA?""Wray: ""Including FISA."" https://t.co/FHRCvkSK8q pic.twitter.com/yYPwBydIFy
Inspector General Michael Horowitz's office found the Russia investigation was launched in July 2016 based on suspicions shared with the U.S. about former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, and that it ""was sufficient to predicate the investigation.""

""This information provided the FBI with an articulable factual basis that, if true, reasonably indicated activity constituting either a federal crime or a threat to national security, or both, may have occurred or may be occurring,"" the report said.

You can read the full report here.
Barr, in a statement reacting to the report's release, stated that he believed the evidence compiled by Horowitz showed that the FBI ""launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken.""
""It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory,"" Barr said. ""Nevertheless, the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump's administration.""""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Pres.

Trump called the report's findings ""an embarrassment"" and ""dishonest"" and said it was ""a very sad day.""

""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday afternoon. ""It should never again happen to another president.""
In a follow-up statement, Barr noted that he was ""grateful"" to the foreign government that had initially provided the FBI with the information on Papadopoulos -- while noting, ""what was subsequently done with that information by the FBI presents a separate question.""

U.S. Attorney John H. Durham too responded in a statement that ""we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened."" He added that ""our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department"" and also included ""developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.""

Horowitz also determined that the controversial ""dossier"" authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was not relied upon in opening the investigation.

According to the report, Horowitz found that DOJ had an authorized purpose in investigating whether there was a crime, and noted the ""low threshold"" for opening such an investigation. He also noted that while former FBI lawyer Peter Strzok was involved in the decision to open the investigation, the actual authorization came from his supervisor Bill Priestap, the former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division.
Horowitz said the office ""did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced (Priestap's) decision.""

However, Horowitz in his year-and-a-half long investigation uncovered ""serious performance failures"" on the part of agents involved in the FISA applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, according to the report.BREAKING: FBI Dir. Chris Wray to @PierreTABC: ""The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivation impacting the opening"" of Russia probe, but ""did find a number of instances where employees ... failed to follow our policies."" https://t.co/iYA592qfam pic.twitter.com/qzdtTeN098— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 BREAKING: FBI Dir.

While Horowitz found no evidence of political bias or improper motivation for the FISA applications for Page, he documented what he described as serious errors and omissions that ""made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.""

The IG documented a total of ""seven significant inaccuracies and omissions"" in the initial FISA application for surveillance on Page, and ""10 additional significant errors in the three renewal applications,"" and said none of the issues were brought to the attention of the Office of Intelligence until the final application was filed in June 2017.

According to the report, the FBI failed to reassess the reliability of Steele's reporting while relying heavily on the material for FISA applications despite obtaining information that raised significant questions about it. However, the IG noted that just because the FBI believed Steele had been hired by Democrat-tied firm Fusion GPS to conduct political opposition research did not require the agency ""under either DOJ or FBI policy, to ignore his reporting.""

Horowitz said the errors ""raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command's management and supervision of the FISA process."".@jonkarl on DOJ inspector general report on origins of Russia probe: ""In this report, there's absolutely nothing"" to corroborate Pres.

Trump's allegations. ""In fact, it directly contradicts those charges."" https://t.co/3lWdFByhuM pic.twitter.com/oQJtfVsUkw
The inspector general also found that the FBI used a confidential human source to approach a ""high-level"" official on the Trump campaign in September of 2016 who was not the subject of investigation, but the source's interactions with the official gleaned nothing of value.

Horowitz did not back Trump's assertions that the FBI planted agents within his campaign, and found agents ""received the necessary FBI approvals"" and that there's no evidence political bias affected the use of confidential sources against Page -- Papadopoulos and the unidentified Trump campaign official. But he also stated that current policies should be updated to reflect investigations of political campaigns.

""We believe that current Department and FBI policies are not sufficient to ensure appropriate oversight and accountability when such operations potentially implicate sensitive, constitutionally protected activity, and that they should require, at minimum, Department consultation,"" the report says.

Since last year, Republicans have zeroed in on DOJ official Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie Ohr had previously worked for Fusion GPS, as part of their mounting line of attacks against the Russia probe.

However, the IG report concluded that Ohr wasn't required to get ethics department approval for his work regarding the Russia investigation, though it added:  ""given the factual circumstances that existed, and the appearance that they created, Ohr displayed a lapse in judgment by not availing himself"" of the DOJ's ethics consultation process.

Prior to its public release, the report was transmitted to Congress where lawmakers and aides reviewed it with staff from Horowitz's office, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. Horowitz is set to testify on the report's findings on Wednesday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

"Trump pardons do 'serious disservice' to military members, senator claims",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trumps-pardons-disservice-military-members-sen-jack/story?id=67475925,"
A key Democratic senator said Tuesday that President Donald Trump did a ""serious disservice"" to military members by  pardoning several servicemen accused, or convicted, of war crimes last month.

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., took the opportunity during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing focused on privatized military housing Tuesday to express his ""deep concern about the president’s recent interference in war crimes cases.""
""The president has the power to pardon, but he has the responsibility to use that power wisely, not recklessly,"" said Reed.

""Some have claimed that these cases were a distraction and that the president’s intervention have somehow improved morale of the military,"" he added. ""On the contrary, President Trump's disregard for our military justice system risked undermining the confidence of our service members and the rule of law and their chain of command, especially those who are courageous enough to bring allegations of war crimes to light, and testify against their teammates.""
Last month, Trump pardoned Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was serving a 19-year sentence for ordering his men to fire on three Afghans, and Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who had been awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to murdering an Afghan man.

A broader controversy followed when Trump restored the rank of Navy Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, who had been convicted in the military justice system of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter but acquitted of murder.

Trump later ordered the Navy to allow Gallagher to keep his status as a SEAL after news broke the Navy was reviewing whether he should keep the Trident pin that identified him as such.

Gallagher’s case led to the firing of former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, whom Defense Secretary Mark Esper had accused of going behind his back to broker a deal with Trump on Gallagher’s SEAL status.
Col. Dave Lapan and Dr. Kyleanne Hunter, both retired Marines, and retired Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, were critical of Trump’s decision to pardon the service members on Sunday’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos.""

""When the military becomes politicized, nothing good can come of it for long-term health of the military,"" said Hunter, who served as a Cobra pilot in multiple deployments.

""This president has often talked about how much he admires the military, how much he has done for the military; it's all about the strength of the military"" said Lapan. ""And I’d ask what these pardons have done to further that goal, rather than making the military stronger, I think he's weakened the military in these days.""

Lapan, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti, disagreed with Trump’s characterization in a tweet in October that said, ""We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill.""
The case of Major Mathew Golsteyn is now under review at the White House. Mathew is a highly decorated Green Beret who is being tried for killing a Taliban bombmaker. We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill! @PeteHegseth
""It was an inappropriate statement,"" said Lapan. ""I think when you say something like that, the president is not fully grasping that they are professionals, that they do have a set of standards and rules that they need to follow.""

At Tuesday’s hearing, Reed invoked a statement by the late Sen. John McCain.
""This is a moral debate. It is about who we are. I don't mourn the loss of any terrorist’s life,"" Reed said, quoting a McCain column from 2011 following the death of Osama bin Laden. ""What I do mourn is what we lose when by official policy or official neglect we confuse or encourage those who fight this war for us to forget that best sense of ourselves.

""Through the violence, chaos and heartache of war, through deprivation and cruelty and loss, we are always Americans, and different, stronger and better than those who would destroy us,"" he continued, before switching back to his own thoughts. ""That is the standard we should demand from our military men and women, and I believe the president’s interference in these cases has done them a serious disservice.""

Elizabeth Warren's health records show she's in 'excellent health',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warrens-health-records-show-shes-excellent-health/story?id=67553874,"
According to medical records released by her campaign on Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a ""very healthy 70-year-old woman.""

""Senator Warren is in excellent health and has been throughout the 20 years I have served as her physician,"" Dr. Beverly Woo, a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, wrote in the medical report. Warren has ""no medical conditions or health problems that would keep her from fulfilling the duties of the President of the United States.""
Woo also disclosed Warren's ""only"" condition is hypothyroidism, a common auto-immune condition most often in women.

""She currently takes levothyroxine 0.88 mg per day, which restores her thyroid hormone level to normal,"" wrote Woo, who has been Warren's doctor since 1999.
Warren's Thyroid Stimulating Hormone level, released as part of her medical records, suggests her hypothyroidism is well controlled. Results of her blood test and vital signs were within normal limits.
According to Warren's medical records, she got a flu shot in October and last got a physical in January. It was ""normal."" She is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs 129 pounds.

The release of Warren's medical records come the day after her opponent former Vice President Joe Biden was told by a voter that he is too old to get his vote. Biden is 77.

Biden has yet to release his medical records. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 78, also hasn't released his records. Health concerns, particularly those related to older candidates in the field, peaked when Sanders had a heart attack earlier this year that took him off the trail for several days.

Both Biden and Sanders have pledged to release their medical records ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
President Donald Trump, 73, recently began portions of his annual physical at Walter Reed Medical Center.

In February 2019, Dr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, released a memo saying the president was in ""in very good health overall"" and should remain so ""for the remainder of his presidency and beyond.""

10 former NFL players charged by DOJ in alleged health care fraud scheme,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-charges-10-nfl-players-alleged-health-care/story?id=67683627,"
The Department of Justice announced charges Thursday against 10 former NFL players over an alleged scheme to defraud millions of dollars from the league's health care benefits program.

Prosecutors allege that the players submitted false and fraudulent claims for high-cost medical equipment to the league's Gene Upshaw Health Reimbursement Account Plan for retired players between June of 2017 and December of 2018.

In a press release, the Justice Department said the charges range from health care fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy -- involving over $3.9 million in false health care claims.
Among those charged include former Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis, 38, former San Francisco 49ers cornerback Carlos Rogers, 38, and former Houston Texans safety Ceandris Brown, 36. The government has also filed a notice that it intends to charge former New Orleans Saints wide receiver Joe Horn, 47, with conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

An attorney for Portis, Mark Dycio, told ABC News Thursday the charges came as a ""shock"" to his client and that Portis maintains his innocence.

""Mr. Portis had no knowledge that his participation in what he believed to be an NFL sanctioned medical reimbursement program was illegal,"" Dycio said.
According to the Justice Department, the former players allegedly offered to submit claims for medical equipment including hyperbaric oxygen chambers, cryotherapy machines and ultrasound machines in exchange for ""kickbacks and bribes that range from a few thousand dollars to $10,000 or more per claim submitted."" The players are alleged to have fabricated documents like prescriptions and invoices in order to secure payouts for their claims.

""The defendants are alleged to have developed and executed a fraudulent scheme to undermine a health care benefit plan established by the NFL -- one established to help their former teammates and colleagues pay for legitimate medical expenses,"" said U.S. Attorney Robert M. Duncan, Jr., for the Eastern District of Kentucky. ""The defendants allegedly submitted false claims to the plan and obtained money for expensive medical equipment that was never purchased or received, depriving that plan of valuable resources to help others meet their medical needs.""

He added, ""We have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud in our office, and we appreciate the partnership we share with the Criminal Division and the FBI in pursuing these important matters.""
In a briefing with reporters, Justice Department officials said they were alerted to the scheme by the health care company Cigna after it detected anomalies in the types of claims being filed by the players. They noted the investigation remains ongoing, leaving open the possibility others may be charged.

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said there's currently no evidence of doctors being aware of or participating in the players' alleged fraud.

Robert McCune, 36, John Eubanks, 36, Rogers and Brown were all arrested, according to a department official, while six others named in the indictments surrendered voluntarily.

The maximum sentence for the charges range from 10 to 20 years, and DOJ noted that all are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

ABC News was not immediately able to reach attorneys for all of the players named in the indictments.

Warren campaign holding star-studded fundraiser despite ripping wealthy donors,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-campaign-hold-star-studded-fundraiser-los/story?id=67532116,"
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is set to host her first campaign fundraiser in the Los Angeles area Saturday. And while Warren won't be there -- she'll be stumping in New Hampshire -- the event is shaping up to have as many stars as a Hollywood movie premiere.

The gathering promises to be replete with celebrity faces -- and a life-size cardboard cutout of Warren.

The fundraiser invite obtained by ABC News boasts ""lots of co-hosts from the entertainment community, a life-size cutout of Elizabeth, pastrami and burritos and -- debuting at this event -- a video station where you can opt to tell the campaign why you love Elizabeth and what issues attracted you to the campaign."" The letter is signed by Warren's finance co-chair, Shanti Fry.
""There is no minimum donation required to attend this event. Some attendees have contributed as little as $3,"" according to the campaign.

It's not uncommon for campaigns to host fundraising events in the candidate's absence, but what distinguishes this event is the star-studded guest list. Among those expected to be in attendance are actor-comedians Jon and Ike Barinholtz, TV writer-producer Marti Noxon, writer and Crooked Media cohost Kara Brown, actress Elizabeth Banks, actor Ben Feldman, comedian Travon Free, author Jenny Han, director Alexandra Kondracke, film producer Franklin Leonard, playwright Janine Nabers, writer Christopher Noxon, actress Busy Philipps, actress Angela Robinson and actor-comedian Adam Scott.
Warren is not the first candidate to employ star power in her bid for the White House. Other Oval Office hopefuls this cycle -- and cycles before --  have been fêted and vetted by Hollywood elites whose financial support and red carpet clout offer the kind of boost a competitive candidate might welcome.

During his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, President Barack Obama netted high-profile support from a number of celebrities, like Jay-Z and his megastar wife, Beyoncé. Both were vocal Obama supporters and held a series of celebrity-hosted fundraisers for the president's reelection campaign.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has played off celebrity endorsements more than anyone so far, including shout outs from Cardi B, Ariana Grande and Mark Ruffalo.
Warren has sworn off big-dollar fundraisers in both the primary and the general election, emphasizing no special access for wealthy donors -- and she leans heavily on a grassroots rallying cry. She's hold Saturday's event in absentia, leaving her plausible deniability for any pay-for-play face time with donors.

The event comes with the L.A. scene a little less split now that California Sen. Kamala Harris has exited the 2020  race. Before Harris' departure, Banks, who recently wrote, directed and starred in a new ""Charlie's Angels"" remake, donated the maximum amount to her campaign at least twice.
But many big Hollywood donors have not yet settled on a candidate.

Several entertainment executives have told ABC News they are keeping their options open because few want to be on the outs with the eventual nominee's inner circle."
'Dark money' ties raise questions for GOP Senator,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/dark-money-ties-raise-questions-gop-sen-ernst-67539327,"
An outside group founded by top political aides to Sen. Joni Ernst has worked closely with the Iowa Republican to raise money and boost her reelection prospects, a degree of overlap that potentially violates the law, documents obtained by The Associated Press show. 
Iowa Values, a political nonprofit that is supposed to be run independently, was co-founded in 2017 by Ernst's longtime consultant, Jon Kohan. It shares a fundraiser, Claire Holloway Avella, with the Ernst campaign. And a condo owned by a former aide — who was recently hired to lead the group — was used as Iowa Values' address at a time when he worked for her. 
Political nonprofits are often referred to as “dark money” groups because they can raise unlimited sums and are not required to reveal their donors. But they must take steps to keep their activities separate from the candidates they support. Additionally, while such tax-exempt groups can do political work, they can’t make it their primary purpose. 
The documents reviewed by the AP, including emails and         a strategy memo, not only make clear that the group’s aim is securing an Ernst win in 2020, but they also show Ernst and her campaign worked in close concert with Iowa Values. 
Ernst is hardly the first politician to push campaign finance law boundaries. But the revelation could complicate her efforts to fend off a Democratic challenger in a closely watched race next year. 
“The truth is, our campaign is completely separate and independent from any outside organization,"" Ernst senior adviser Brook Ramlet said in a statement. “Our campaign always has and always will act in full compliance with and in the spirit of the law. For the AP to suggest otherwise, is the definition of fake news.”
Campaign finance law states that candidates and their “agents” can't solicit, direct or spend contributions that exceed federal limits, even if the donations are made to an outside group. Those limits currently prevent donors from giving more than $2,800 to a candidate and $5,000 to a political action committee per election. 
In July, Holloway Avella requested “an investment of $50,000” from a donor after Ernst made an introduction. She made clear in an email, which was obtained by the AP, how much a contribution of that size could help. 
“As a follow up to our introduction by Senator Ernst, I am reaching out to you on behalf of Iowa Values,” she wrote.
“As you may have seen, an outside group on the left ... recently launched a six-figure ad buy in media markets across the state attacking Senator Ernst on her vote to repeal Obamacare,” she continued. “The purpose of our group, Iowa Values, is to push back against these type of negative attacks.” 
Separately, a strategy memo states the group will use door-knocking, as well as TV, radio and digital advertising, to build a “firewall” that could be the difference “between winning and losing in 2020 for Senator Ernst.” The group is targeting about 120,000 Iowans who “lean Republican on the issues” but abandon the party at times over “the tone of the GOP.”
Taken together, some legal experts say the documents offer proof that the effort violates the spirit of campaign finance and tax law, if not the letter of it. 
“It seems like pretty strong evidence” that the $50,000 request was for an “illegal donation” while it's “clear that the goal of Iowa Values is to reelect Joni Ernst, which may violate its tax-exempt status,” said Brendan Fischer, an attorney with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington.
He also said the documents pulled back the curtain on how dark money works. 
“This is a striking example of how secret campaign money operates,” Fischer said. “The big donors that bankroll a dark money group like Iowa Values remain hidden from the public, but the politician that benefits knows where the money is coming from.” 
Still, it’s far from certain that the Federal Election Commission, or the IRS, will find that they broke the law. 
The FEC often gridlocks along partisan lines. And after a recent resignation, the panel doesn’t have enough members to legally meet for conducting business. Similarly, the IRS has shown little appetite for cracking down on dark money groups that push the limits. 
“There’s a real disconnect between the principles behind the law and how they are enforced,” said Larry Noble, a former general counsel to the FEC who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Noble said he would need more details before assessing whether Ernst’s campaign broke the law. But, he added: “The bottom line is that this is really questionable.” 
Dan Petalas,  a former acting general counsel at the FEC, said that the “law is undecided” but that his personal view is the fundraising was permissible because Holloway Avella said she was requesting the $50,000 on behalf of Iowa Values, not the campaign.
In a statement, Iowa Values executive director Derek Flowers said the organization has “systems and controls in place to make certain that it complies with all laws” and is “careful to follow all requirements that limit how much of its activities can be focused on supporting candidates.”
What’s undeniable is the close connection between Ernst and the group. 
Kohan, a former Ernst deputy chief of staff who is now a general consultant to her campaign, was paid $120,000 to serve as executive director of Iowa Values for two years, according to the group's tax filings. He left the group earlier this year. Jamestown Associates, where he is a named partner, also collected an additional $101,000 from Ernst’s campaign in the years he served as executive director. 
Holloway Avella raised about $520,000 for Iowa Values in         2017 and         2018, tax records show. The group lists her Arlington, Virginia, office as one of its business addresses and paid her about $60,000. Ernst paid her an additional $363,000 those years, record show. 
The group listed a Waukee, Iowa, condo owned by Flowers as another business address in 2017, records show. Flowers was campaign manager during Ernst’s 2014 Senate primary. A company called Midland Strategies, which has been paid $145,000 by Ernst since 2013, also listed Flowers’ condo as a business address. Flowers succeeded Kohan as the group's executive director this year.
After Ernst launched her reelection campaign, Holloway Avella was deeply involved with both operations. 
Holloway Avella's website lets prospective donors request to host a fundraiser for the senator. And invitations for several recent Ernst events list her as an organizer, including two held in September at Bistro Bis, a French eatery a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. 
Around the same time, Holloway Avella was seeking donations for Iowa Values from prominent Ernst supporters, like dieting entrepreneur Jenny Craig and San Francisco philanthropist Diane “Dede” Wilsey. Craig previously gave $30,000 to Ernst; Wilsey donated $46,000. 
A         legal compliance letter Holloway Avella sent to donors underscored the delicate terrain. 
Iowa Values’ mission “is to educate the public about common-sense solutions to various public policy issues of national importance,” it stated. “It was not formed by any federal candidates or agents of candidates or at the direction or request of any candidates or an agent of a candidate.”"

5 takeaways from Hillary Clinton’s interview with Howard Stern,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/takeaways-hillary-clintons-interview-howard-stern/story?id=67504589,"
Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton sat down for a wide-ranging interview with radio host Howard Stern that touched on everything from impeachment to her relationship with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Here are five takeaways from the 2 1/2 hour discussion.

1. Clinton believes there was a quid pro quo from President Donald Trump.

Clinton said she believes that Trump was trying to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in their July phone call.

“Let’s not mince words -- Trump was trying to bribe the president of Ukraine to take action by announcing the beginning of an investigation on an unfounded theory against his domestic political opponent for his personal and political gain,” Clinton said. “You can’t make it up. Who would ever think anybody would do that?”
2. Clinton said attending Trump’s inauguration was one of the hardest days of her life.

“I went to the inauguration of Donald Trump, which was one of the hardest days of my life, to be honest,” she said. She remarked on how she was seated next to former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, during Trump’s speech.

“Then he started on that speech, which was so bizarre, and that’s when I got really worried,” she said. “And George W. Bush says to me, 'Well that was some weird s---.'”

3. Clinton warned of the dangers of interference in the 2020 election, and said that she has told Democratic candidates to be wary of what could happen. 

“I think that, you know, look, the Russians and WikiLeaks really did a job on me, both in terms of the way they weaponized information and then the way that they -- they’re doing it again, they’re doing it to whoever else is going to be up there,” she said.
4. Clinton stopped short of saying who she supports in the race so far, telling Stern she will support whoever the nominee is.

“It’s up to the voters to decide,” she said. But Clinton did say she thinks that, based on polling, the nominee will be former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think it’s too soon to tell because nobody has voted or caucused, so right now, according to the polls, Biden is going to get the nomination. But that’s, you know, a long way off,” she said.

She also said that in the indictments of Russian troll groups from the 2016 elections, “they’re basically like, ‘Hey let’s do everything we can to elect Donald Trump,’ ... I mean it also said Bernie Sanders, but that’s for another day.”

5. Clinton said Sen. Bernie Sanders ""hurt"" her in the general election, but, after being prompted by Stern, said that she does not hate him.

“No, I don’t hate anybody,” she said, though she did argue that Sanders could have endorsed her quicker after he left the race.
“He could have. He hurt me, there’s no doubt about it,” she said. “And I hope he doesn’t do it again to whoever gets the nomination. Once is enough.”

Sanders endorsed Clinton in early July of 2016, about a month after it became known that Clinton had the delegates nationwide to obtain the nomination, and a week before the Democratic National Convention.

Clinton has largely ruled out a run in 2020, but has remained in the public eye as she promotes her new book, ""The Book of Gutsy Women,"" which she co-authored with her daughter. She did say, though, that she plans to work to help elect a Democrat in 2020.

Thousands more US troops could be headed to Middle East,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thousands-us-troops-headed-middle-east/story?id=67504430,"
The White House is weighing the possibility of sending thousands more U.S. troops to the Middle East to deter continued Iranian provocations, according to officials familiar with the planning. A U.S. official said sending more troops is pegged to possibly maintaining an enduring U.S. troop presence in the Middle East given the continued level of Iranian threats.

The White House has not yet made a decision on the possibility of sending more troops to the region, according to a U.S. official and a source familiar with the planning.

The idea of sending more American troops to the Middle East has been in the works for months but it is more likely given the threat from Iran right now, said the source familiar with the planning.
Since the missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September, that the U.S. blames on Iran, the U.S. has continued to see provocations from Iran.
On Wednesday, it was disclosed that last week a U.S. Navy destroyer seized an Iranian dhow with missile parts headed to Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The New York Times also reported on Wednesday that in another provocative move Iran has been using Iranian-backed militias to secretly flow an arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq.

""People are not paying enough attention to the fact that ballistic missiles in the last year have been placed in Iraq by Iran with the ability to project violence on the region,"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., told the New York Times in an interview.

During a recent visit to Baghdad, the former Defense Department official cautioned Iraqi officials that if Iran launched a missile from inside Iraq it could risk continued U.S. training and support to Iraq.

Tensions with Iran have remained high since May when the U.S. perceived an imminent Iranian threat to U.S. forces and interests.

Since then an additional 14,000 U.S. troops have been sent to the region to deter Iran including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, air defense forces and aircraft.

But those are temporary deployments and though some of the forces are being replaced by follow-on units, military planners have to plan for the possibility of a longer-lasting ""enduring"" presence.

That would mean establishing a regular rotation of forces to maintain current U.S. troop levels. It could also mean possibly sending additional capabilities that would entail sending more forces.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. was weighing sending 14,000 additional troops, including dozens of ships and new capabilities to the region. That report drew a sharp denial from Alyssa Farah, the Pentagon press secretary, who tweeted, ""The U.S. is not sending 14,000 troops to the Middle east to confront Iran.""

Trump on DOJ IG report: 'Attempted overthrow' despite finding his claims unfounded,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-watchdog-finding-origins-fbis-russia-investigation-proper/story?id=67605235,"
Even though a major Department of Justice inspector general report released Monday determined the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election was launched with an authorized purpose, President Donald Trump claimed that the report ""was far worse than I ever thought possible.""

""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday afternoon. ""It should never again happen to another president.""

He called the report's findings ""an embarrassment"" and ""dishonest"" and said it was ""a very sad day.""""It's a disgrace what's happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,"" Pres.

Trump says of IG report findings.The report found the Russia investigation was launched with proper cause, despite missteps in how agents handled the probe. https://t.co/rDpNuZpUTv pic.twitter.com/gqKEQwNk9s
The Justice Department's internal watchdog found the Russia investigation was not improper, despite significant allegations of wrongdoing in how agents handled the counterintelligence probe of Trump's presidential campaign.

But despite Trump's claims, the report did not vindicate months of allegations Trump and his allies made about the origins of the FBI's investigation. Rather, the department's inspector general exonerated FBI leadership of the president's accusations they were engaged in a conspiracy to sabotage his campaign.
Despite the findings, Trump labeled the investigation an ""attempted overthrow"" of the government.

""It was concocted, and you say what you want, that was probably something that's never happened in the history of our country,"" Trump said.
In an exclusive broadcast interview with ABC Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas, FBI Director Chris Wray said he did not think the agency had treated the Trump campaign unfairly. .@PierreTABC to @GStephanopoulos on his interview with Chris Wray: ""I asked the FBI director point blank if he thought that the FBI had treated the Trump campaign unfairly.

Even as the president sought to characterize Monday’s findings as a bombshell, he also teased a separate, forthcoming report from a U.S. attorney appointed by Attorney General William Barr to look at the conduct of intelligence agency officials who initiated the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.

The attorney, John Durham, said in a statement Monday that even though his investigation was ongoing, based on the evidence his team had collected so far, ""last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.""

Trump said Monday that he believed Durham's report would prove more significant.

""I look forward to the Durham report, which is this information plus plus plus,"" he said. ""I’m going to put this down as one of our great achievements."""
Joe Biden denies he is mulling a one-term pledge if elected president,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-denies-mulling-term-pledge-elected-president/story?id=67662497,"
Former Vice President Joe Biden denied discussing with his campaign advisers whether he would only seek one term in office if elected president-- claims that were first published by  POLITICO Wednesday.

The report cited anonymous advisers to Biden who said there have been internal conversations about recent signals from the 77-year-old former vice president would only seek one term if elected in 2020.

“No, I never have,” Biden said when asked by a reporter on Wednesday if those discussions were taking place.  “I don’t have any plans on one term.”

A senior adviser for Biden's campaign has also pushed back on the report, calling it “just not true.”
“Maybe there's an alternative Biden campaign where these things are being discussed,” the adviser told ABC News.

“You’ve heard him say how presumptuous it is to speculate about a VP. How much more presumptuous is it to say you’re only going to serve one term?” they added.

Biden’s campaign and deputy campaign manager also took to Twitter to categorically denying that any have taken place.

“Lots of chatter out there on this so just want to be crystal clear: this is not a conversation our campaign is having and not something VP Biden is thinking about,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager tweeted.

“Not sure what orbit of advisers reporters talk to,  but count me with @KBeds, this is not a conversation we are having among people who actually are running the campaign.  Also - hope everyone is seeing all the endorsements coming out for @JoeBiden,” Biden’s Campaign Manager, Greg Shultz tweeted.

Biden, who would be 78 on inauguration day and the oldest president ever elected, often faces questions about his age on the trail and throughout his run for president has pushed back on committing one way or another on running for a second term.

During his first interview after announcing his presidential run on ABC’s The View, Biden said he wouldn’t commit to only one term and that making a determination on that was not necessarily his choice.

“I may end up, if I get elected, only having one term, but the idea of committing not to do one term. Look, I, here’s the deal: I think it’s important for people, it’s a legitimate question to ask about my age, and the dame question was asked of me at age 29, whether I was old enough to serve. It’s a question of whether or not, hopefully, I can demonstrate, not only with age comes wisdom, and experience that can make things a lot better. And look, that’s for you all to decide,” Biden said on the topic.

In an October interview, Biden again would not commit on running for a second term if he were to be elected.

“I feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you’ll see,” Biden said in an interview with the Associated Press. “It doesn’t mean I would run a second term. I’m not going to make that judgment at this moment.”"
Warren's records show she's in 'excellent health',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warrens-health-records-show-shes-excellent-health/story?id=67553874,"
According to medical records released by her campaign on Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a ""very healthy 70-year-old woman.""

""Senator Warren is in excellent health and has been throughout the 20 years I have served as her physician,"" Dr. Beverly Woo, a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, wrote in the medical report. Warren has ""no medical conditions or health problems that would keep her from fulfilling the duties of the President of the United States.""
Woo also disclosed Warren's ""only"" condition is hypothyroidism, a common auto-immune condition most often in women.

""She currently takes levothyroxine 0.88 mg per day, which restores her thyroid hormone level to normal,"" wrote Woo, who has been Warren's doctor since 1999.
Warren's Thyroid Stimulating Hormone level, released as part of her medical records, suggests her hypothyroidism is well controlled. Results of her blood test and vital signs were within normal limits.
According to Warren's medical records, she got a flu shot in October and last got a physical in January. It was ""normal."" She is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs 129 pounds.

The release of Warren's medical records come the day after her opponent former Vice President Joe Biden was told by a voter that he is too old to get his vote. Biden is 77.

Biden has yet to release his medical records. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 78, also hasn't released his records. Health concerns, particularly those related to older candidates in the field, peaked when Sanders had a heart attack earlier this year that took him off the trail for several days.

Both Biden and Sanders have pledged to release their medical records ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
President Donald Trump, 73, recently began portions of his annual physical at Walter Reed Medical Center.

In February 2019, Dr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, released a memo saying the president was in ""in very good health overall"" and should remain so ""for the remainder of his presidency and beyond.""

"Giuliani to send Ukraine report to Congress, Barr",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Politics/rudy-giuliani-hoping-submit-ukraine-report-congress-ag/story?id=67609387,"
Rudy Giuliani said he will transmit a ""report"" based on his recent visit to Ukraine to Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in Congress by the end of this week.

""I should probably have it ready on Wednesday or Thursday,"" Giuliani said Monday morning while appearing on ""War Room: Impeachment,"" a radio show hosted by Steve Bannon and Jason Miller. ""I don't exactly know when it'll be made public, but it should be ready by then. I worked on it all weekend.""

Giuliani's report is likely to outline his alleged findings from his trip last week to Kyiv and Budapest, where President Donald Trump's personal attorney, spent several days interviewing current and former Ukrainian officials in an attempt to gather evidence that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. Giuliani, who traveled to Europe as part of a documentary series produced by far-right news network One America News Network (OAN), said his findings will undermine Democrats' impeachment probe back in Washington.
As such, Giuliani said he hoped to present his evidence to congressional Republicans before the House Judiciary Committee votes on articles of impeachment, which could happen before Congress breaks for the holiday.

""It would really bear on fact that the president was not only justified in making this call, the president was required to make this call,"" Giuliani said.
In an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday with ABC News, FBI Director Christopher Wray  undercut the theory that the government of Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,"" said Wray, the most senior, currently serving, government official to undercut the claim.
When asked about the claim, Wray urged Americans to be cautious about their sources of information.

""Well, look, there's all kinds of people saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information, to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear,"" he told ABC News. ""And I think part of us being well protected against malign foreign influence is to build together an American public that's resilient, that has appropriate media literacy and that takes its information with a grain of salt.""

Trump first hinted at the possibility of Giuliani's Ukraine report being sent to Congress on Saturday while speaking to reporters at the White House.

""He's going to make a report, I think to the attorney general and to Congress,"" Trump said. ""He says he has a lot of good information. I have not spoken to him about that information.""
During his radio interview on Monday, Giuliani highlighted a document he obtained alleging misconduct by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

""I know the president is gonna probably get really hot about this,"" Giuliani said, hinting that he may have described to the president some of this information over the phone.
""I haven't been able to describe it to him in person, but it makes everything he did absolutely justified,"" he added, referring to Trump's dismissal Yovanovitch in May.

Giuliani and his associates engaged in an elaborate scheme to undermine Yovanovitch, according to a number of witnesses who testified as part of the impeachment probe in the House. Trump has echoed Giuliani's criticism of the veteran diplomat, telling ""Fox & Friends"" last month, she ""was not an angel, this woman.""
""They're doing it in order to stop me from commenting, stop me from defending him, uh, after all I am his lawyer"" Giuliani stated. ""Horrific, actually.""

Giuliani reiterated he is conducting this work on behalf of his client and not to influence the 2020 election.
""I could care less at this point about the 2020 election,"" Giuliani said. ""My job is to defend my client and that's why I was there now.""

Giuliani's work on matters related to Ukraine and his business dealing with two Soviet-born associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, is the subject of an ongoing investigation by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, sources have previously told ABC News."
US seizes Iranian weapons headed to Yemen,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-seizes-iranian-missile-parts-headed-yemen/story?id=67500074,"
The U.S. military seized a ""cache of weapons and advanced missile components"" believed to be of Iranian origin in the northern Arabian Sea, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.

The small vessel carrying the weapons, referred to as a dhow, was believed to be headed to Yemen, a U.S. official told ABC News, where the missile parts would likely support Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The dhow carried dissembled part for anti-ship cruise missiles, land attack cruise missiles, air defense missiles and anti-tank missiles, the official said.
""On November 25th, a U.S. warship conducted a flag verification boarding in the Arabian sea in accordance with international law of what was subsequently determined to be a stateless vessel, and discovered a cache of weapons and advanced missile components,"" said Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson in a statement. ""An initial investigation indicates that these advanced missile components are of Iranian origin. A more thorough investigation is underway.""

The USS Forrest Sherman, a Navy destroyer, interdicted the dhow early last week in the northern Arabian Sea, and a U.S. Coast Guard boarding party seized the guided-missile parts, a second U.S. official said.
The dhow's crew was held aboard the U.S. destroyer while the missile components were transferred aboard the ship, that official said. The crew has already been released and given to Yemeni authorities, the first official said, but it's unclear where the dhow and crew were transferred.

The Associated Press, which was first to report the seizure, said it was the first time that such sophisticated components have been taken en route to the war in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning, a top Pentagon official said that the U.S. continues to see ""indications"" that Iranian aggression could occur. That warning came one day after CNN reported that ""fresh intelligence"" showed there is a ""potential Iranian threat against U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East,"" as evidenced by the movement of Iranian forces and weapons in the region.

""We also continue to see indications, and for obvious reasons I won't go into the details, that potential Iranian aggression could occur,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood told a small group of reporters.
Rood said that in the aftermath of Iranian attacks over the summer -- attacks which targeted commercial ships, a Saudi oil facility and a U.S. drone -- the U.S. moved about 14,000 additional U.S. troops into the Middle East and ""stepped up messaging"" to Iran in order to discourage further attacks.

""Watch this space,"" he said. ""I think we're going to be dynamic in our deployments, in our response and how we message. In private, you should know we've sent very clear and blunt signals to the Iranian government about the potential consequences of aggression.""

The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group was one of the U.S. assets rushed to the Middle East in May to deter what at the time appeared to be imminent threats to U.S. interests and forces in the region from Iran.

The carrier transited the Strait of Hormuz out of the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, after spending almost two weeks there. While in the Persian Gulf, the Lincoln made a port call in Bahrain, the first port visit during its Middle East deployment that is expected to come to an end soon with the expected arrival of the USS Harry S. Truman."
'Very nasty': Trump blasts Macron at NATO summit,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-blasts-macron-nasty-nato-comments-ahead-london/story?id=67458948,"
After hurling some harsh words at French President Emanuel Macron earlier Tuesday, President Donald Trump struck a decidedly softer tone while seated beside his French counterpart at an afternoon photo op ahead of the NATO summit in London.

Trump downplayed the bubbling trade dispute between the two countries as “minor” and predicted things will “rosy” again soon.

“We do a lot of trade with France and we have a minor dispute,” President Trump said. “I think we’ll probably be able to work it out. But we have a big trade relationship, and I’m sure that within a short period of time, things will be looking very rosy, we hope, that’s usually the case with the two of us, we work it out.”

The president’s diplomatic tone on the issue comes after the U.S. Monday night threatened $2.4 billion in tariffs on French goods in retaliation of France’s taxes that hit U.S. tech companies.

Trump did not repeat his previous comment calling Macron’s critique of NATO “very,very nasty” and an ""insulting statement"" but President Macron, for his part, said he stands by his critique of NATO as experiencing “brain death.”
Trump earlier repeated his complaints that some NATO nations weren't paying their ""fair share.""

“My statement created some reactions,” Macron said. “I do stand by … When you look at what NATO is and should be, first of all, this is a burden-share, and President Trump just reminded you of some figures, that the U.S. over invested decade after decade, it was number one by far.”

The president then thanked Macron for his comments in recognition of U.S. payments.

“I appreciate you saying the United States for decades had been paying way, way disproportionately too much for NATO and you have other countries paying far too little that are directly benefited by it,” Trump said.

In an exchange that showed there was perhaps more tension under the surface regarding the fight against ISIS, Trump offered to send some of the “tremendous amount of captured fighters” to France, claiming “they're mostly from Europe.”

“Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you,” Trump said.

But the French President wasn’t having it.

“Let’s be serious,” Macron replied, going on to offer a response in which he talked about the need to finish the fight against ISIS.

“And that’s why he’s a great politician, that was one of the best non-answers I’ve ever heard,” Trump then replied.

Earlier, Trump was tougher on Macron when he spoke to reporters during an appearance with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the U.S. ambassador's residence in London, ahead of a summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic alliance.

“You can’t just go around making statements like that about NATO, it’s very disrespectful,” Trump said, despite his having once called NATO “obsolete.”

“Nobody needs [NATO] more than France,” Trump said, “if you just look back over the last long period of time,” in an apparent reference to World War I and World War II.
“I’m not in love with those companies,” he said. “If anybody is going to take advantage of our companies it’s going to be us,” he said.

France has threatened a forceful response if the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to hit the country's cheese, Champagne, handbags and other products with tariffs of up to 100%.

Last month, in an interview with The Economist magazine, Macron had urged NATO to “wake up,” warning that member states were failing to cooperate on key issues and calling into question the future of the alliance.
President Trump has repeatedly chastised NATO allies for not contributing enough financially to the alliance.

All 29 NATO member states have committed to increase their defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2024, but NATO data estimates that only seven members -- including the U.S. -- are estimated to meet the spending target this year.

During the freewheeling appearance with Stoltentberg, Trump also touched on a number of other topics, including the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.

Responding to the suggestion that the probe may overshadow his visit, he said: “Does it cast a cloud? If it does, then the Democrats have done a great disservice to the country.”
The president took a diplomatic approach when questioned about the general election in the summit’s host country, Britain, due to take place Dec. 12. “I stay out of it,” he said, adding that he could “work with anybody,” who came to power after the vote.

Trump has in the past been a vocal support of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, once dubbing him “Britain's Trump,” and has criticized opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would be “so bad” for the country.

Deutsche Bank must turn over Trump's records,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-appeals-court-orders-deutsche-bank-turn-records/story?id=67463368,"
A New York federal appeals court ruled Tuesday morning that Deutsche Bank must turn over copies of President Donald Trump's financial records subpoenaed by the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees, marking the latest blow to the president's effort to keep his financial records private.

The appellate judges in the ruling wrote that a lower court must determine how to disclose the information without revealing personal information.

Two of the appellate judges signed onto the opinion, while one other judge concurred in part and dissented in part.

The opinion does not mention the ongoing impeachment inquiry proceedings explicitly, but notes that they had been considered in a separate ongoing lawsuit involving Trump's financial records.
Circuit Court Judge Jon Newman in the opinion stated that, ""the interests of Congress in pursuing the investigations for which the challenged subpoenas were issued substantially 'overbalance' the privacy interests invaded by disclosure of financial documents,"" describing the public need for the congressional investigation as ""of the highest order.""

""The legislative purposes of the investigations concern national security and the integrity of elections,"" Newman wrote, while he also noting that the privacy interests concerning disclosure of Trump's private financial documents might ""distract"" the president's performance of his official duties.

The opinion also notes that Trump was subpoenaed for documents related to his personal dealings, and not his business in an official capacity.

""The Second Circuit decision is another in a long line of decisions strongly affirming 'a broad power of Congress and its committees to obtain information in aid of its legislative authority under Article I of the Constitution,"" Chairman Adam Schiff and Chairwoman Maxine Waters said in a statement. ""The decision today also affirmed that the subpoenas issued by the House Financial Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have a valid legislative purpose.""
""We believe the subpoena is invalid as issued,"" Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys, told ABC News in a statement. ""In light of the Second Circuit decision, we are evaluating our next options including seeking review at the Supreme Court of the United States.""

Brianne Gorod, chief counsel for the Washington-based nonprofit Constitutional Accountability Center and an expert in the constitution law, told ABC News that the ruling is a ""resounding victory"" not only for House Democrats but also for the rule of law.

""Congressional oversight has deep roots in our nation's legal and political tradition, and the House subpoenas at issue in this case fall well within Congress's broad oversight authority,"" Corod said in a statement. ""Moreover, the public interest strongly supports allowing Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House's subpoenas because, as Judge Newman rightly recognized, ""(t)he public interest in vindicating the Committees' constitutional authority is clear and substantial.""
Tuesday's decision follows a series of other court rulings that have taken the side against the president in his fight to shield his tax returns.

Earlier this year, both the district court and appeals court in Washington sided with House Democrats in the president's lawsuit against the House Oversight Committee's subpoena for financial records from the Trump Organization's accounting firm Mazars. Similarly, a New York district court and the appeals court both sided with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office seeking the president's tax returns.
Both the House Democrats' case and the Manhattan DA's case have been brought up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and both of the lower courts' orders have been temporarily halted while the highest court of the country reviews the cases.

In another lawsuit involving Trump's New York state tax returns, a federal judge in D.C. ruled that Congress must notify the president before it requests his state tax returns under a new state law that allows disclosure of the president's state tax returns, and that the request will trigger a 14-day review period by the court before the Congress obtains the records."
Minority presidential candidates concerned about waning diversity in field,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/candidates-color-raise-concern-depleting-diversity-democratic-presidential/story?id=67495855,"
Shortly after California Sen. Kamala Harris announced she was ending her presidential bid, the question of depleting diversity in the Democratic field became a rallying point for several of the remaining minority candidates in their own campaigns.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker in an impassioned speech on Thursday blasted the influence of money in politics as one of the reasons she dropped out.

“When an immensely qualified, widely supported truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa. What message is that sending?” Booker said. “I'm just gonna say it plain it is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people.”

The criticism is especially salient given that the current Democratic field is the most diverse in history.

However, several minority presidential candidates have complained that the structure of the Democratic National Committee's polling and fundraising rules to qualify for debates unduly makes it difficult to get the coveted primetime spots on stage needed to gain the national spotlight.

Further, they argue, billionaire-late comers to the race--all of them white men-- have been able to leverage their money to ensure they have ads in critical early state markets and in the social media spaces necessary to net the small donor donations to qualify for the debates.
It is an issue Harris herself cited in a video to supporters announcing she was leaving the race.

“So here’s the deal guys my campaign for president simply does not have the financial resources to continue,” Harris said. “I’m not a billionaire, I can’t fund my own campaign.”

The DNC has said the process has been balanced and fair and highlighted the current diversity in the field.

""This has been the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires. We are proud of this historic and diverse field with 20 candidates participating in the first two debates and at least 10 candidates in each debate after that. While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,"" said DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa. ""Nobody who has failed to reach 4% at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.""

Harris had qualified for the Democratic presidential debate later this month. With her departure from the race, only six candidates have made the cut to be on the debate stage-- none of them are people of color.

The situation offers an opportunity for self-reflection for the Democratic Party, said a political strategist who wished to remain anonymous.

""I think it's just a moment of reckoning for the party that's like, 'okay, why are we still ending up with an all-white top tier of candidates as the field winnow?' ” he said.

Booker’s presidential campaign said it saw its biggest online fundraising day the day after Harris dropped out, a surge they credit to people’s concerns that the diverse presidential field is narrowing.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, announced his campaign had raised over $360,000 since Harris suspended her candidacy and sounded a similar note of alarm during a call with reporters during said a pre-planned visit to Harris’ home state of California.

“There’s a renewed sense out there that our primaries need better representation. Especially because we’re headed towards the debate, that will have no people of color on the stage,” Castro said.
Asked about the potential of an all-white debate stage in the upcoming Democratic debate, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren also expressed concern.

""I mean, that’s the whole point. We are now looking at potentially a stage of -- there will not be a single person of color on that stage. And as I said, women have been forced out of this race at a time when billionaires can buy their way in. Michael Bloomberg just did a $37 million ad buy in one week in order to make himself a candidate, while he skips the usual parts of democracy like shaking hands with people and hearing directly about their concerns,"" Warren said.

Her departure has also sparked a scramble for Harris’ supporters and staff as Iowans prepare to cast the first ballots on Feb 3.

Castro didn’t answer directly if he was trying to clinch some of Harris’ endorsements, saying, “We're working hard for endorsements from elected officials, community leaders all across the country. Of course, especially in the early states and super Tuesday states.”

Mitch Henry, co-founder and communications director of Iowa’s Asian & Latino Coalition which  endorsed Harris says that Castro’s campaign was the first of at least three other campaigns who reached out within hours of her announcement. He estimates that Castro’s campaign reached out about five minutes after Harris dropped out.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaigns also reached out within four hours of Harris dropping out, Henry said.

Henry has since endorsed Sanders’ campaign, although the coalition hasn’t decided who to back as a group yet.

“Where she stood on many issues is, you know, where Bernie stands. I mean, yes there's a difference in the Medicare for All, they both stood for Medicare for All, like Sen. Warren too but they had different proposals of how to get there,” Henry said.

Vanessa Phelan, chairwoman of the Northwest Des Moines Democrats, an endorser of Harris, said she started getting contacted by surrogates of other campaigns less than 24 hours after the senator ended her campaign.

“Yeah, I think I got the first text that evening,” Phelan said.

“Staffers, I know you are doing your jobs and you are lovely people and I like you bunches but please do not try to organize me today. TOO SOON,” she tweeted a day after Harris dropped out.
But she also considers the some of the renewed interest into Harris’ campaign and the people who support her disingenuous.

“People were happy to peddle misinformation, while she was in the race. Now that she's dropped out, people have nothing but respect for her. So it's, it's upsetting to me to see the attention that she is getting now. I think now people are starting to pick up on the fact that how inspirational she is to children. In particular, girls,” Phelan said.

Harris' campaign woes also stemmed from her own missteps, political experts said.

She was often criticized for not picking out a lane for herself in the Democratic field and either identifying herself as a moderate or more left-leaning candidate. Harris’ supporters backed her for a variety of reasons, making it harder to know who her supporters may endorse next in her absence.

""Part of the problem in terms of trying to figure out where Kamala Harris' supporters go, is that I think she had such a fragmented message that there wasn't a cohesive base behind her,” said, Jessica Levinson, political commentator and professor of law at Loyola Law School. “And so my guess is that they just kind of fan out.  That there are some people who want a woman, there are some people who want a candidate of color, there's some people who want a moderate, there are some people who want a younger take of it.”

Glynda Carr. president and ceo of Higher Heights for America PAC, which seeks to help elect black women in elections across the country, a group which endorsed Harris in November,  said that although they aren’t planning on endorsing another candidate and none have reached out since Harris’ suspended her bid, they’ll continue to help candidates engage with black female voters, a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party.

“Having a cycle starting with one of the most diverse stages, we've ever seen in the Democratic primary has pushed the envelope, not as far as we would like in some of our partnering organizations, but centering conversation of voters that look more like the electorate,” Carr said.

"House GOP lays out defense of Trump on Ukraine, says he wasn't looking at 2020",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-lays-defense-trump-ukraine-focused-2020/story?id=67447159,"
A new report by House Republicans reviewed by ABC News on Monday argues that President Donald Trump shouldn’t be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to “benefit in the 2020 election.”

The 123-page report is the official GOP response after several weeks of closed-door and public testimony that detailed Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to announce an investigation that included Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Several witnesses testified that the White House dangled a presidential summit in exchange for the probe, and that Trump froze nearly $400 million in much-needed security assistance just days before calling Zelenskiy and asking for a “favor,” including an investigation into the Bidens.
Republicans countered the testimony and text exchanges obtained by Democrats as “hearsay, presumption and emotion.” They also argued that Democrats are pursuing impeachment as a “tool for settling political scores and re-litigating election results with which they disagreed.” And they say the witnesses never produced clear evidence that Trump was doing it to sway 2020 election, rather than addressing “genuine concerns” about corruption in Ukraine.
“The evidence presented in this report does not support a finding that President Trump pressured President Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival for the President’s benefit in the 2020 election,” the Republican report states.
“The Democrats’ impeachment narrative ignores the President’s state of mind,” the assessment later adds.

Democrats will no doubt take issue with the findings. Whereas Republicans argue in the new report that the transcript of Trump’s call doesn’t show “conditionality, pressure or coercion,” witnesses testified that such pressure was implied because Ukraine was a vulnerable democracy still fighting Russia at its border and desperate for U.S. support.

Witnesses also called into question the president’s insistence that he was genuinely focused on corruption and not domestic politics. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a Trump megadonor, testified that the White House only wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation that included Hunter Biden’s involvement in the Ukraine gas company, Burima, and that he didn’t think it was necessary for Ukraine to conduct the probe.
Former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill called this push a “domestic political errand.” And she directly disputed Trump’s theory that Ukraine – not Russia – meddled in the 2016 election, calling it a “fictional narrative” pushed by Russian security services.
In the Republican report, they insist there is “compelling and indisputable evidence that Ukrainian officials” sought to influence the election in favor of Democrat Hilary Clinton. While some Ukrainian politicians did support Hillary Clinton over Trump, U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate inquiry found the primary culprit behind election interference was Russia, which engaged in a widespread, invasive and secretive campaign to sway voters in support of Trump.

Republicans also argued there was no evidence of ""bribery"" or ""extortion.""

“The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats’ witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor,"" the report states.

The Republicans add that Trump is accountable to voters and that Americans will decide whether he acted in their best interests come 2020.

""The accountability to the American people comes at the ballot box, not in House Democrats’ star chamber,"" they stated.

Top officials could testify in Senate trial: Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-pompeo-mulvaney-testify-senate-impeachment-trial/story?id=67463857,"
A day before the next public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into how he and his administration handled military aid to Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he could direct top administration officials to testify in a possible Senate trial.

The White House has blocked administration officials from cooperating with the House impeachment effort. Asked why he has blocked them from appearing as Democrats have repeatedly requested
Trump said he would like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry to testify but once again claimed the House proceedings are ""unfair.""

“It will be fair in the Senate,” the president said during a photo op with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the NATO summit in London., a reference to the fact that Republicans will have greater control of the process in the Senate, where they have a majority.

“I would love to have Mike Pompeo and Mick and I would love to have Rick Perry, and many other people testify. But I don't want them to testify when this is a total fix. You know what a fix is? It's a fix. Just think of it,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing process in the House of Representatives.
While the president is now drawing a distinction that he’d be willing allow these individuals to testify in the Senate, he has previously argued that he is fighting for the presidency in refusing compliance, warning that “future presidents should in no way be compromised.”

Trump said he would not send his own lawyers to participate in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, calling it a ""hoax.""

Trump has previously made comments about allowing high-ranking officials to testify or answer questions but has not taken any steps to make that happen.
Trump also used some of his strongest language yet in attacking the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, calling him ""deranged"" and a ""maniac,"" accusing him of twisting his words when Schiff read an interpretation of the transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy.

The president predicted that the ratings will be bad for Wednesday's first impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.

“Tomorrow, I don't think anybody is going to watch. I won't watch, I'll be doing this, it is much more exciting,” Trump said.

The president said Republicans would want former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to testify.

But when asked by a reporter what he thinks he can learn from Schiff, the president said “I learn nothing from Adam Schiff” and launched into a tirade against the Democrat, who has had a leading role in the impeachment process.

""I learned nothing from Adam Schiff. I think he is a maniac. Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he is a very sick man. And he lies. Adam Schiff made up my conversation with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""And one of the reasons people keep talking about it is that's what they saw.""

The president also claimed, as he has before, that the impeachment battle is helping him politically, saying we are “winning so big” and falsely claiming his poll numbers have never been better."
3 key takeaways on final House impeachment hearing,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-final-house-impeachment-hearing/story?id=67605378,"
Congressional lawyers made their case to lawmakers Monday on the impeachment of President Donald Trump, presenting the final testimony in a weeks-long effort that has divided the nation.

The next step will be consideration of articles of impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee as early as Wednesday.
Here’s what to know:

The hearing provided little new insight into Trump’s actions in Ukraine and plodded along at times. But it enabled both sides to present their findings to the American public through a political lens one final time before lawmakers vote on articles of impeachment.
Democratic counsel Dan Goldman said Trump was engaged in a “persistent and continuing effort” to coerce a foreign government to “help him cheat to win an election,” making him a “clear and present danger” to U.S. elections and national security.
Republican counsel Stephen Castor said nothing the president has done rises to the level of impeachment and accused Democrats of “searching for a set of facts” they could use to discredit the president since he was elected.
The hearing grew testy as opposing legal counsel were allowed to question one another, and Republicans repeatedly interjected with procedural objections.

In one particularly heated exchange, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, demanded details from Democratic counsel Goldman about the Democrats’ subpoena of phone records.

“Who ordered it? Was it you?” said Collins, questioning whether the records were added to the final impeachment report for “smear purposes.”
Goldman replied that his question would be better directed as Trump allies involved in the “scheme” to pressure Ukraine.

“I am going to go on record and tell you I'm not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,” he said.

Goldman did acknowledge though that the committee issued “at least four” subpoenas to Verizon and AT&T, but said none of them specifically targeted members of Congress.

Republican counsel Castor testified that he was aware of six subpoenas issued by the Democrats that targeted Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani; an associate of Giuliani’s, Igor Fruman, who faces campaign finance charges; and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

Included in the phone log is a call between Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and Lev Parnas, who also faces federal charges on campaign violations. Nunes told Fox News earlier this month that he’s never met Parnas and couldn’t recall talking with him on the phone.
For President Richard Nixon and Watergate, the million dollar question was “What did the president know and when did he know it?” And President Bill Clinton’s impeachment is mostly remembered for Clinton’s famous denial of an extra-marital affair with a White House intern: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”

Collins tried to make the point that there was so little evidence of Trump’s wrongdoing that Americans wouldn’t able to come away with a single, memorable line for Trump’s impeachment inquiry. He said perhaps the only big takeaway line is “where is the impeachable offense?”

Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon later told reporters she thought Americans would remember Trump’s words to Ukraine’s president in his July 25 phone call: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Trump used the phrase in response to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanking Trump for U.S. military support and asking about “next steps.”

“I don’t think there’s any question,” Scanlon said of Americans remembering the line, which was repeatedly referenced by Democrats throughout the hearing.

The White House decided against cooperating with the inquiry, repeatedly calling it a sham and refusing to provide documents or testimony.

Late Friday afternoon, White House counsel Pat Cipollone signaled that Trump wouldn’t be sending legal representation on Monday, quoting Trump on the effort: “If you’re going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.”

But the refusal to cooperate also limited the GOP ability to directly tackle the Democratic argument that Trump was engaged in historic stonewalling of Congress and should face impeachment articles on obstruction.
President Donald Trump tweeted and retweeted repeatedly, touting the economy, calling the inquiry a “Witch Hunt!” and urging his supporters to “Read the Transcripts!”
Trump later told reporters that he did watch some of the hearing.

""Very little. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to our country. It's a hoax, and it should never, ever be allowed to happen again,"" he said.

Analyzing the legal experts' arguments for and against impeaching Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analyzing-legal-experts-arguments-impeachment/story?id=67488991,"
Four legal scholars - Professors Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law and Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School -- each made passionate arguments before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday about whether President Donald Trump's conduct meets the Constitution's standard for impeachment: ""Treason, Bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

ABC News Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer, along with ABC News contributors Katie Shaw and Dan Abrams, analyzed those arguments on both sides of the impeachment inquiry.
In her analysis, Shaw said that the witnesses spent the morning describing ""the framers' worst nightmare.""

For example, Karlan testified ""the very idea that a president might seek the aid of a foreign government in his re-election campaign would have horrified [the Founders], but based on the evidentiary record, that is what President Trump has done.""

""When they drafted these impeachment clauses in the Constitution, they were worried about foreign interference, corruption and self dealing, trying to entrench yourself in power, maybe interference in an election. They say, it's very rare you have all those things collide in a single sequence of events the way you have here,"" she said.
Of the experts going beyond an academic discussion to flatly state whether the Trump should -- or should not be -- impeached, she said: ""They went further than I expected, both in the written statements and their testimonies, in suggesting something like a duty to move forward, not just the constitutional standards having been satisfied.""

On that point, when Democratic Counsel Norm Eisen asked the witnesses from the outset: “Did President Trump commit impeachable high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power based on that evidence and those findings?” Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt all said yes.
“On the basis of the testimony and evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency,” Feldman said, specifically citing Trump's request for Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy to pursue investigations into the Bidens and purported Ukraine interference in the 2016 election.

""The record compiled this far shows that the president has committed several impeachable offenses,' Gerhardt agreed, ""including bribery, abuse of power in soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit himself personally, obstructing justice and obstructing Congress.""
Turley, the sole witness called by Republicans, said no, saying that Democrats have not established evidence of a crime. Turley said that while Trump's actions may have been inappropriate, they are not impeachable. A bribery charge would especially be a stretch, he said.

""This isn't improvisational jazz. Close enough is not good enough. If you're going to accuse a president of bribery, you need to make it stick because you're trying to remove a duly elected president,"" Turley said.

But in her analysis, Shaw said that ""it doesn't matter that much exactly what the Supreme Court said about the federal criminal statute because the world bribery was included in the Constitution before there were even any federal laws that targeted bribery, so it means something different,"" a point Karlan made in her testimony, as well.

Turley also raised questions about the timeline and process, arguing that Democrats are rushing to impeach the president without hearing from all witnesses or allowing the courts to adjudicate disputes between Congress and the White House.

""If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you are criticizing the president for doing. We have a third branch that deals with conflicts of the other two branches, and what comes out of there, and what you do with it is the very definition of legitimacy,"" Turley claimed.

Abrams, in his analysis, acknowledged that this may be the Republicans' strongest argument against an obstruction of justice charge -- that Democrats should let the courts weigh in.

""[Turley] concedes you don't need a crime to impeach, but he is saying there's never before been a case where there wasn't a crime included. He in essence if you look at everything he's saying, he's saying the standard needs to be higher for impeachment than Congress is applying here,"" Abrams said. ""I think he was a very persuasive witness based on the facts and law that they have on that side.""

Shaw agreed with her fellow legal contributor.

""[Turley's] not condoning any of the conduct that's alleged here. He says this shakedown, if proven, could well be impeachable. It's just that the facts aren't there yet, so the House should take his time,"" she said.

Abrams continued that, despite Republicans like Rep. Matt Gaetz dismissing the process as a joke as he told ABC News' Dwyer Wednesday morning, Turley does not take the process lightly.

""The bottom line is that while Turley does not think there's enough here to convict the president and to, you know, successfully impeach -- that doesn't mean that he thinks that this is ridiculous that this whole process is moving forward -- because he doesn't,"" Abrams said. ""He even said the call wasn't perfect, you know, he said that straight-out. But that's a separate question from, is it enough to get impeachment and conviction.""
Karlan argued that it doesn't matter whether Trump's act succeeded and Gerhardt pointed out how every president who has been impeached failed to achieve their goals.

“President Nixon was subject to articles of impeachment preferred by this committee for attempting to cover up the Watergate break-in. The fact that the president was not ultimately successful in covering up the break-in was not grounds for not impeaching him,"" Gerhardt said. ""The attempt itself is the impeachable act.""

Shaw said Gerhardt, in particular, put Democrats' closer to obstruction charges.
""Both Nadler in his opening and the witness testimony, in particular the Gerhardt testimony, makes clear that other presidents have resisted these requests, other presidents may have engaged in obstruction of Congress, but this president's level of obstruction is totally unprecedented,"" Shaw said. ""To the extent that they seem to be interested in building a strong article around obstruction of Congress, you saw the seeds of that today.""

""I think that there are a lot of questions about the substantive misconduct, and I think there will be certainly be at least one article around abuse of power, potentially bribery, but obstruction of Congress,"" Shaw continued. ""Gerhardt says the obstruction here was worse even than Nixon, and there was an article approved alleging obstruction against Nixon.""
Dwyer noted the view that judging the president might be better left to voters in the 2020 election -- and Feldman responding that the historical origins of impeachment were rooted in a fear a president might ""corrupt the electoral process and ensure his re-election.""

Dwyer said that while Republicans and Turley argued in favor of slowing down the impeachment process, Democrats and their witnesses argued the integrity of U.S. elections are at stake in the meantime.

He noted Karlan's testimony on that point. ""She argued, time and again, that the election just one year from now is at risk of foreign interference. The president, she mentioned in her testimony, did it in 2016. Remember when he called out Russia, 'if you're listening get involved here.' Of course, the Russians were involved at the time. She alleged that he did it again with Ukraine, in this case, and she said the only way to stop that and reprimand him is impeachment,"" Dwyer said/

""Countless Americans have fought and died to protect our right to vote,"" Karlan said. ""But the framers of our Constitution realized that elections alone could not guarantee that the U.S. would remain a republic. One of the key reasons for including an impeachment power was the risk that unscrupulous officials might try to rig the election process.""
Nadler addressed the notion pushed by Republicans in his opening statement: ""We are all aware that the next election is looming, but we cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis. The integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake,"" Nadler said. ""The president has shown us his pattern of conduct. If we do not act to hold him in check now, President Trump will almost certainly try again to solicit interference in the election for his personal political gain.""
Shaw drew on the witness testimonies in her analysis to illustrate that the framers allowed for impeachment as opposed to the view currently prevalent in public opinion that judgment on the president might be better left to voters.

""Feldman says [the framers] thought about just letting elections address presidential misconduct but decided that certain kinds of misconduct couldn't just be left to the political process. They needed something more serious to address them, and that's especially the case, as Karlan emphasized, when the misconduct that's alleged is tied to an election,"" Shaw said. ""If manipulating the election is the charge, you can't just let the election run it's course.""

Pensacola shooting suspect: Why was he there?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pensacola-naval-base-shooting-suspect-identified-member-saudi/story?id=67555812,"
Friday's shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, in which four people, including the shooter, died, marks the second time this week gun violence erupted at a U.S. military installation.

But while Wednesday's shooting in Hawaii was related to a domestic issue, the attack on Friday became international incident after it was reported the suspect was a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force.

Mohammed Alshamrani, according to authorities, was one of about 200 foreign nationals receiving training on the naval air base as part of a program in which U.S. allies send members of their armed forces there to study aviation.

Alshamrani's training on the base, which included English language and basic aviation courses, started in August 2017 and was scheduled to finish by August 2020, according to the Department of Defense.

His participation in the program is part of a military practice that goes back decades, NAS Pensacola base commander Capt. Timothy Kinsella said during a press conference in the aftermath of the shooting

""The cross-training with allies is something that we have done for a long time,"" he said. ""In World War II, we had Royal Air Force folks training here.""
Saudi Arabia, according to the Pentagon, is one such ally, and has supplied 852 of the more than 5,000 foreign military students spread throughout the U.S.

Germany, Singapore, Italy, Denmark and Norway have also sent students to Naval Air Station Pensacola, also known as the ""Cradle of Naval Aviation.""

NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. The facility includes the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Marine Aviation Training Support Group 21 and 23, the Blue Angels and the headquarters for Naval Education Training Command.

According to Kinsella, only authorized security forces are allowed to carry weapons on the base. It's still unclear how Alshamrani was able to bring a handgun into the classroom and begin shooting.

And while Alshamrani's motive remains unclear, law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News authorities are focusing on two possibilities: that he was acting for ideological reasons, or that some kind of hostilities developed over the course of his training.
Shortly after the shooting, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saudi Arabia was ""going to owe a debt here,"" and numerous Saudi officials condemned the attack in statements.

""Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime. The Kingdom expresses its deepest condolences to the families of victims, and to the American people. We salute the bravery of those who neutralized the threat and saved lives,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan tweeted.Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime.

The Kingdom expresses its deepest condolences to the families of victims, and to the American people. We salute the bravery of those who neutralized the threat and saved lives.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters on Friday that the vetting process for foreign military nationals in the U.S., including screenings by the Department of Defense and U.S. embassy personnel, will be reviewed.

""I want to make sure we're doing our due diligence,"" Esper said, ""to understand what are our procedures.""

Trump considering adding controversial attorney to impeachment legal team: Sources,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-adding-controversial-lawyer-alan-dershowitz-impeachment/story?id=67674015,"
Gearing up for an impeachment trial in the Senate, President Donald Trump and his top advisers are considering expanding his legal team and bringing on controversial attorney and professor Alan Dershowitz, multiple sources told ABC News.

Dershowitz attended an event Wednesday at the White House and was asked to speak briefly by the president ahead of signing an executive order on anti-Semitism.
""I have advocated that there needs to be one other attorney that's added to the mix for the president, and that is Alan Dershowitz,"" Congressman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a Trump confidant, told the House Freedom Caucus podcast on Wednesday. ""I think he'd be great to come in, get Alan Dershowitz in to be part of that defense team.""

Dershowitz, who was often called upon by the White House and the president's attorneys to appear on television during the Mueller investigation, has been in the headlines due to his ties to now-deceased accused child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Dershowitz was a member of a star legal team that represented Epstein during his multiple investigations beginning in the mid 2000s.
Virginia Roberts Giuffre has alleged in courts documents that she was lent out to Dershowitz for sex by Epstein. Dershowitz has vehemently denied those accusations.

As the White House sets its sights on an impeachment trial, questions have mounted about who would lead the president's defense.
One of the president's personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, is a focus of the impeachment probe and work he did as it relates to Ukraine. Separately, Giuliani's relationship with two Ukraine-born men -- Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted this fall by federal prosecutors -- is the subject of a criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York, according to sources familiar with the matter.
In an op-ed published earlier this week, Dershowitz wrote that the two articles of impeachment proposed by the House Judiciary committee failed to meet the standard in his opinion. ""Both are so vague and open ended that they could be applied in partisan fashion by a majority of the House against almost any president from the opposing party.""

Dershowitz, a longtime professor at Harvard University, most notably won the appeal of Claus von Bülow's 1982 conviction for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny. He was also part of the legal ""Dream Team"" for O.J. Simpson's murder trial.

Trump impeachment case moves to House Judiciary,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-case-enters-historic-phase-house-judiciary/story?id=67471278,"
The investigation into President Donald Trump enters a historic next phase on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the constitutional grounds for drafting articles of impeachment.
The process of drawing up any articles, now becoming increasingly likely, could begin shortly after members question legal and constitutional experts about what the Constitution requires.

Three witnesses have been called by Democrats: Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, and Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law.

Testifying for Republicans will be Jonathan Turley of The George Washington University Law School.
The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.
Expected to be highly contentious, the hearing comes a day after the House Intelligence Committee, led by Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, published its report on its investigation into alleged misconduct by the president in regard to Ukraine.

Much of the focus now will be on the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, and whether he can control Republican objections and maintain the momentum of the Democrats' impeachment drive -- an effort that Trump on Tuesday once again called a ""hoax.""

Trump has turned down an invitation from Nadler that he and his lawyers participate.

ABC News and ABC News Live will provide complete live coverage of Wednesday's hearing.

"President Jimmy Carter back in hospital, looks forward to 'returning home soon'",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-jimmy-carter-returns-hospital-forward-returning-home/story?id=67448771,"
Former President Jimmy Carter is back in the hospital, one of many recent stays for the 95-year-old Democrat.

Carter is in the hospital with a urinary tract infection, according to The Carter Center.

""Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga., this past weekend for treatment for a urinary tract infection,"" The Carter Center said in a statement. ""He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon. We will issue a statement when he is released for further rest and recovery at home.""
He is the oldest ex-president in U.S. history.

The Maranatha Baptist Church, in Plains, Georgia, said earlier Monday afternoon that Carter would be not be teaching for the rest of the month. The church released the statement before learning of Carter's return to the hospital. The Sunday school teachings -- a tradition of Carter's for many years -- were canceled after he underwent brain surgery in late November.

""Our other miracle is President Carter,"" the Maranatha Baptist Church said in a statement. ""Although he has been released from the hospital from his surgery, we want to make sure he takes the full surgery recovery time before teaching again. For this reason, his Sunday School lessons on December 8 and December 22, 2019 will be cancelled. His niece, Kim Fuller will deliver inspiring messages throughout the month of December.""
Carter was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta the day before Thanksgiving after spending two weeks in the medical facility following brain surgery as a result of a subdural hematoma. He suffered the injury in a fall, one of many he's suffered in recent months.
""The Carters are grateful for all the prayers, cards, and notes they have received and hope everyone will join them in enjoying a special Thanksgiving,"" a statement from the Carter Center read after his release last week.

Carter sustained a 'minor pelvic fracture' in October after falling and required 14 stitches above his brow after another fall in early October.

In his first of three falls this year, the former president underwent hip surgery in May after falling before a turkey hunting excursion.

Carter served as governor of Georgia for one term before running for president in 1976. He defeated Republican Gerald Ford in a competitive race in the general election, but served just one term before being defeated by eventual two-term President Ronald Reagan in 1980.

GOP House members consider other options in wake of NC redistricting,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/redistricting-leads-north-carolina-gop-house-members-options/story?id=67554035,"
Several North Carolina Republicans in Congress are facing potential uphill battles to serve their current districts  during the 2020 elections after a state court determined that old congressional maps were the result of partisan gerrymandering.

Such moves could further complicate broader Republican efforts to recapture the House amid a slate of GOP retirements. Republicans currently hold seats in 10 of the state’s 13 congressional districts. Under the new maps, it is expected that Democrats will pick up two seats, making the divide 8 to 5.

Races in North Carolina are on track to become some of the most expensive in the country in 2020. NextGen America, a group funded by Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, announced in November plans to spend $4.5 million on voter engagement efforts in the state to elect Democrats in the Senate and other statewide offices.

According to ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG, the Senate race has seen nearly $13 million in TV ad buys with just under a year until the election.

The focus on North Carolina draws sharp into relief the changes taking place at the ground level in House districts.

Rep. George Holding found the state’s 2nd Congressional District altered into a likely Democratic stronghold and announced Friday that he will not seek reelection as a result.

""The newly redrawn Congressional Districts were part of the reason I have decided not to seek reelection,"" Holding said in a statement. ""But, in addition, this is also a good time for me to step back and reflect on all that I have learned.""

Holding isn't necessarily alone in considering his options. Holding and Rep. Mark Walker, of the state's 6th Congressional District, currently represent what will be Democratic districts.
Last week, Holding told reporters that he would choose not to run in a primary against another colleague to represent North Carolina in the House.
In the old may, the 2nd Congressional District included areas of Wake County where the population is predominantly white and also some neighboring Republican-leaning areas said J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor at Crystal Ball.

""But now, the new 2nd District, it's entirely Wake County, so it has more of the bluer parts of the Raleigh area,"" Coleman said.

Sabato’s Crystal Ball now rates the district as ""Safe Democratic.""

Democratic lawyer Deborah Ross has already announced she will run for the seat. Ross ran a close race against Sen. Richard Burr for Senate in 2016, with endorsements from a number of prominent Democratic organizations including EMILY’s List and the North Carolina AFL-CIO,. She ultimately lost.

In June, before any changes to the congressional maps had been made, Walker issued a statement saying he would not primary against incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis saying the support of ""conservatives across North Carolina encouraging me to run for the Senate has been deeply humbling,"" he said. ""I am confident that my continued service in the House will best help our efforts to reclaim the majority from Nancy Pelosi and advance our shared conservative goals.""
However, months later, after the congressman's district was redrawn to include more Democratic-leaning enclaves such as larger, more liberal, nearby cities, like Winston-Salem, Walker expressed interest in a potential primary against Tillis or running for a congressional seat in 2022, according to a spokesperson for Walker.  Crystal Ball rates Walker’s redrawn current seat as ""Safe Democratic.""

Political experts believe that North Carolina will gain a fourteenth House seat after the 2020 Census takes place.

""North Carolina definitely is going to gain a seat in the Census. I would be surprised if it isn’t another Democratic-leaning seat,"" Coleman said. ""As you get more districts, it’s harder to gerrymander them, you have less room for creativity, basically.""
Diane Parnell, the Rockingham County GOP chairwoman told reporters recently that she would like to see Walker run for Senate.

""He’s doing this not for himself, he’s doing this for us,"" she told WXII, a local news station.

Walker doesn’t have long to decide: The state’s filing deadline is Dec. 20

5 takeaways from Hillary Clinton’s Stern interview,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/takeaways-hillary-clintons-interview-howard-stern/story?id=67504589,"
Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton sat down for a wide-ranging interview with radio host Howard Stern that touched on everything from impeachment to her relationship with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Here are five takeaways from the 2 1/2 hour discussion.

1. Clinton believes there was a quid pro quo from President Donald Trump.

Clinton said she believes that Trump was trying to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in their July phone call.

“Let’s not mince words -- Trump was trying to bribe the president of Ukraine to take action by announcing the beginning of an investigation on an unfounded theory against his domestic political opponent for his personal and political gain,” Clinton said. “You can’t make it up. Who would ever think anybody would do that?”
2. Clinton said attending Trump’s inauguration was one of the hardest days of her life.

“I went to the inauguration of Donald Trump, which was one of the hardest days of my life, to be honest,” she said. She remarked on how she was seated next to former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, during Trump’s speech.

“Then he started on that speech, which was so bizarre, and that’s when I got really worried,” she said. “And George W. Bush says to me, 'Well that was some weird s---.'”

3. Clinton warned of the dangers of interference in the 2020 election, and said that she has told Democratic candidates to be wary of what could happen. 

“I think that, you know, look, the Russians and WikiLeaks really did a job on me, both in terms of the way they weaponized information and then the way that they -- they’re doing it again, they’re doing it to whoever else is going to be up there,” she said.
4. Clinton stopped short of saying who she supports in the race so far, telling Stern she will support whoever the nominee is.

“It’s up to the voters to decide,” she said. But Clinton did say she thinks that, based on polling, the nominee will be former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think it’s too soon to tell because nobody has voted or caucused, so right now, according to the polls, Biden is going to get the nomination. But that’s, you know, a long way off,” she said.

She also said that in the indictments of Russian troll groups from the 2016 elections, “they’re basically like, ‘Hey let’s do everything we can to elect Donald Trump,’ ... I mean it also said Bernie Sanders, but that’s for another day.”

5. Clinton said Sen. Bernie Sanders ""hurt"" her in the general election, but, after being prompted by Stern, said that she does not hate him.

“No, I don’t hate anybody,” she said, though she did argue that Sanders could have endorsed her quicker after he left the race.
“He could have. He hurt me, there’s no doubt about it,” she said. “And I hope he doesn’t do it again to whoever gets the nomination. Once is enough.”

Sanders endorsed Clinton in early July of 2016, about a month after it became known that Clinton had the delegates nationwide to obtain the nomination, and a week before the Democratic National Convention.

Clinton has largely ruled out a run in 2020, but has remained in the public eye as she promotes her new book, ""The Book of Gutsy Women,"" which she co-authored with her daughter. She did say, though, that she plans to work to help elect a Democrat in 2020.

Trump looking to reconsider toilet rule,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-reconsider-requirement-low-flow-toilets-67554491,"
When it comes to toilets, President Donald Trump just wants to let it flow.
Trump said Friday that his administration is looking into relaxing water-saving regulations for toilets, sinks and showers, saying consumers end up using even more water by flushing multiple times and trying to get clean with low water streams.
“People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once. They end up using more water,'' Trump said while talking with business owners about what he said are ‘’common sense'' steps to end overregulation. ""The EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion.''
Use of low-flush toilets started in the 1990s after President George H.W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act. The 1992 law said new toilets could use no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush. The law went into effect in 1994 for residential buildings and 1997 for commercial structures. 
Trump said he's also looking at possibly relaxing regulations for sinks and showers. 
“You go into a new building, a new house or a new home and they have standards and you don't get water,'' he said. ""You can't wash your hands practically there's so little water that comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you so much longer to wash your hands and you end up using the same amount of water.''
Trump said relaxing water-conservation standards might not be practical in some arid regions of the nation, but in many states, there is plenty of water. ‘’It comes down. It's called rain,'' he said. "
5 key takeaways from House report on Trump impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-house-report-trump-impeachment/story?id=67474868,"
In a historic move, House Democrats have released a 300-page sweeping report outlining their case for President Donald Trump's impeachment. The evidence presented in the report will be used by the House Judiciary Committee to draft those specific articles of impeachment.
Here are the top takeaways from the report:

Democrats say Trump placed his personal interests above the nation

Citing weeks of closed-door and public testimony by several top administration aides, Democrats allege that Trump abused his power as a sitting president by soliciting a foreign government to benefit his reelection. They say he did this by holding up plans for a presidential summit and nearly $400 million in security assistance until Ukraine would announce an investigation that included Trump's 2020 political rival, Joe Biden.

""In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security,"" the Democrats wrote.

Republicans have argued in their own report, released on Monday, that Democrats have ignored Trump's ""state of mind,"" noting that he had a ""reasonable skepticism"" of Ukraine because of its history of corruption. They say there's no specific evidence that the president had the 2020 election in mind when he pressed Ukraine to launch an investigation into Biden's actions as vice president and his son, Hunter.
Democrats note in their report that according to several witnesses, Trump's actions on Ukraine were at odds with official U.S. foreign policy, which called for supporting the new government in Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression.
Democrats lay out the case for obstruction, witness intimidation

The Democratic report also accuses Trump of trying to block their inquiry, potentially laying out the case for an impeachment article on obstruction.

With Trump insisting the inquiry is a ""hoax,"" the White House had ordered witnesses to ignore congressional requests for documents and testimony.

Several aides from the White House, Pentagon and State Department agreed to testify anyway under subpoena. But those closest to the president, who could speak to the president's ""state of mind,"" have refused to cooperate, including Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Democrats note that no other president has gone to such lengths to thwart a congressional inquiry.
""Even President Richard Nixon -- who obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidence -- accepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committee,"" the report states.
The report also calls out Trump for taking to Twitter to criticize witnesses who were testifying.

""The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of Americans -- including witnesses' families, friends, and coworkers,"" Democrats stated, adding that it's a federal crime to intimidate a witness appearing before Congress.

'Bribery' and 'extortion' aren't mentioned, yet

The report, drafted by the House Intelligence Committee, doesn't use the terms ""bribery"" or ""extortion"" specifically, despite top Democrats having accused Trump of exactly that. But Democrats have suggested that the final decision on whether bribery should be included as an article of impeachment is up to the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested in an NPR interview on Tuesday that it should be.

""I don't think there's any question that the uncontested facts show this president solicited a bribe,"" Schiff said.
There are phone records.

While much of the report recaps previous testimony, Democrats released call logs they obtained of Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani, who was in frequent contact with the White House, including the budget office.
It's unclear exactly what Giuliani discussed with his White House contacts, but the logs show Giuliani was in frequent contact with the White House, including a 13-minute phone call with the Office of Management and Budget. That Aug. 8 call came as Giuliani also was working with diplomats Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland to press Ukraine into launching the investigations Trump wanted.

Democrats point blame at Pence, cabinet secretaries

Democrats in the report also accuse Trump's inner circle of collaborating with him on the pressure campaign, including naming Pence, Pompeo, Perry and Mulvaney as ""knowledgeable of or active participants"" to ""extract from a foreign nation the political benefits sought by the President.""

Pence and Perry's offices have denied putting any political pressure on Ukraine, while Mulvaney has referred to witness testimony about his role as ""speculation."" Pompeo has not directly addressed allegations of his involvement, saying only that he was ""proud of what we've accomplished"" on Ukraine. All four have declined to cooperate with the congressional inquiry.
Democrats though point specifically in the report to Mulvaney's press conference in which he acknowledged that politics influences foreign policy and told reporters to ""get over it.""

Schiff told reporters that no one should ""get used to this.""

""We are signaling to any future president that can engage in whatever corruption, malfeasance or negligence and they are beyond accountability,"" he said.

US considers sending more troops to the Middle East: top Pentagon official,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thousands-us-troops-headed-middle-east/story?id=67504430,"
A top Pentagon official confirmed on Thursday that the U.S. is considering sending additional American troops to the Middle East due to concerns about the threat stream emanating from Iran.

""The [defense] secretary, if he chooses to, can make a decision to deploy additional forces,"" John Rood, under secretary of defense for policy, said during a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""It is possible that we would need to address our force posture,"" he later told senators, adding that it ""could be a prudent step"" to do so.

A U.S. official familiar with the planning told ABC News on Wednesday that the White House was weighing the possibility of sending thousands more American forces to the Middle East to deter continued Iranian provocations. But, the source said the White House has not yet made a decision.
The idea of sending more American troops to the Middle East has been in the works for months but it is more likely given the threat from Iran right now, the source said.

Since the missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September, that the U.S. blames on Iran, the U.S. has continued to see provocations from Iran.

On Wednesday, it was disclosed that last week a U.S. Navy destroyer seized an Iranian dhow with missile parts headed to Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The New York Times also reported on Wednesday that in another provocative move Iran has been using Iranian-backed militias to secretly flow an arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq.

""People are not paying enough attention to the fact that ballistic missiles in the last year have been placed in Iraq by Iran with the ability to project violence on the region,"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., told the New York Times in an interview.

During a recent visit to Baghdad, the former Defense Department official cautioned Iraqi officials that if Iran launched a missile from inside Iraq it could risk continued U.S. training and support to Iraq.
Tensions with Iran have remained high since May when the U.S. perceived an imminent Iranian threat to U.S. forces and interests.

Since then an additional 14,000 U.S. troops have been sent to the region to deter Iran including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, air defense forces and aircraft.

But those are temporary deployments and though some of the forces are being replaced by follow-on units, military planners have to plan for the possibility of a longer-lasting ""enduring"" presence.

That would mean establishing a regular rotation of forces to maintain current U.S. troop levels. It could also mean possibly sending additional capabilities that would entail sending more forces.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the U.S. was weighing sending 14,000 additional troops, including dozens of ships and new capabilities to the region. That report drew a sharp denial from Alyssa Farah, the Pentagon press secretary, who tweeted, ""To be clear, the reporting is wrong. The U.S. is not considering sending 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.""

A statement from Farah on Thursday doubled down on that denial of the 14,000 figure but did not elaborate what other options are under consideration.

""As discussed in the hearing today, we are constantly evaluating the threat situation around the world and considering our options,"" she said. ""We adjust our force posture and troop levels based on adversary action and the dynamic security situation.""

She added, ""Secretary Esper spoke to Chairman [James] Inhofe this morning and reaffirmed that we are not considering sending 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East at this time."""
Former NFL players charged with health care fraud,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-charges-10-nfl-players-alleged-health-care/story?id=67683627,"
The Department of Justice announced charges Thursday against 10 former NFL players over an alleged scheme to defraud millions of dollars from the league's health care benefits program.

Prosecutors allege that the players submitted false and fraudulent claims for high-cost medical equipment to the league's Gene Upshaw Health Reimbursement Account Plan for retired players between June of 2017 and December of 2018.

In a press release, the Justice Department said the charges range from health care fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy -- involving over $3.9 million in false health care claims.
Among those charged include former Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis, 38, former San Francisco 49ers cornerback Carlos Rogers, 38, and former Houston Texans safety Ceandris Brown, 36. The government has also filed a notice that it intends to charge former New Orleans Saints wide receiver Joe Horn, 47, with conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

An attorney for Portis, Mark Dycio, told ABC News Thursday the charges came as a ""shock"" to his client and that Portis maintains his innocence.

""Mr. Portis had no knowledge that his participation in what he believed to be an NFL sanctioned medical reimbursement program was illegal,"" Dycio said.
According to the Justice Department, the former players allegedly offered to submit claims for medical equipment including hyperbaric oxygen chambers, cryotherapy machines and ultrasound machines in exchange for ""kickbacks and bribes that range from a few thousand dollars to $10,000 or more per claim submitted."" The players are alleged to have fabricated documents like prescriptions and invoices in order to secure payouts for their claims.

""The defendants are alleged to have developed and executed a fraudulent scheme to undermine a health care benefit plan established by the NFL -- one established to help their former teammates and colleagues pay for legitimate medical expenses,"" said U.S. Attorney Robert M. Duncan, Jr., for the Eastern District of Kentucky. ""The defendants allegedly submitted false claims to the plan and obtained money for expensive medical equipment that was never purchased or received, depriving that plan of valuable resources to help others meet their medical needs.""

He added, ""We have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud in our office, and we appreciate the partnership we share with the Criminal Division and the FBI in pursuing these important matters.""
In a briefing with reporters, Justice Department officials said they were alerted to the scheme by the health care company Cigna after it detected anomalies in the types of claims being filed by the players. They noted the investigation remains ongoing, leaving open the possibility others may be charged.

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said there's currently no evidence of doctors being aware of or participating in the players' alleged fraud.

Robert McCune, 36, John Eubanks, 36, Rogers and Brown were all arrested, according to a department official, while six others named in the indictments surrendered voluntarily.

The maximum sentence for the charges range from 10 to 20 years, and DOJ noted that all are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

ABC News was not immediately able to reach attorneys for all of the players named in the indictments.

Senate recognizes Armenian genocide despite Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-recognizes-armenian-genocide-trump-white-house-opposition/story?id=67692138,"
In a historic vote, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution to recognize as genocide the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman-era Turkey a century ago, overcoming weeks of active opposition from President Donald Trump's White House as it convinced three Republican senators to block earlier votes.

The vote is sure to further roil U.S.-Turkish relations and upset the country's strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who, despite a warm relationship with Trump, has overseen a fraying between the two NATO allies.

This is the first time this kind of resolution passed the Senate -- unanimously, no less -- and weeks after a similar measure passed the House, 405 to 11. Lawmakers have said they're increasingly upset with the Turkish government for its offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces that fought with the U.S. against ISIS and its purchase of a Russian missile defense system that violates U.S. law and undermines the NATO alliance's security.
The resolution, for which the Armenian government and diaspora have long asked, officially recognizes the mass violence against and forced displacement of Armenian Christians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. As many as 1.5 million Armenians died. The modern-day Turkish government vehemently rejects the label of ""genocide,"" admitting atrocities took place, but saying there was no systematic campaign to exterminate Armenians.
After the House passed its resolution, Turkey's foreign ministry called it a ""grave mistake"" that ""will negatively affect the image of the U.S. before the public opinion of Turkey as it also brings the dignity of the U.S. House of Representatives into disrepute.""
The Trump administration had been urging individual Republican senators to block the resolution for weeks, even as Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reintroduced the legislation. The White House has said the timing of the resolution is inappropriate, just weeks after Erdoğan visited Washington, as he and Trump try to patch things up.

On three occasions, the administration was successful. Sen. Lindsey Graham blocked a vote on the day of Erdoğan's visit, Sen. David Purdue blocked one a week later and Sen. Kevin Cramer blocked one just last week -- even though he was a co-sponsor of a similar resolution in 2017.
Trump has praised Erdoğan and pushed for closer ties with Turkey, but lawmakers of both parties have sought to penalize its government for behavior they've said damages U.S. interests. At the top of that list is Turkey's offensive against the majority-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces that served as de facto U.S. ground forces against ISIS. That operation included potential war crimes by Turkish-backed opposition groups, according to the U.S. Defense Secretary and special envoy for Syria.

Critics, including prominent Republican senators, blasted Trump as giving a green light to Erdoğan for the assault, and after the U.S. and Turkey reached an agreement to halt it, Trump embraced the Turkish leader at the White House and removed any sanctions on senior Turkish officials.
The administration has also so far refused to sanction Turkey for its purchase of the Russian S400 missile defense system despite a 2017 law Trump signed requiring sanctions for any significant Russian defense purchases.

That softer approach to Ankara has fueled a stronger stance in Congress, including renewed support for the Armenian genocide declaration.

It's also gotten a boost from celebrity backers who are Armenian American.
Kim Kardashian West urged her followers to call their senators and ask them to vote yes on the resolution hours before the vote Thursday, writing in an Instagram post: ""Denial is the final stage of genocide.""

Some moderate Dems still undecided on impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/moderate-democrats-undecided-impeachment-explain/story?id=67695821,"
With a House floor vote on impeachment rapidly approaching, many moderate House Democrats said on Thursday they're still reviewing the charges drawn up against President Donald Trump, and will use the weekend to decide how to cast the most consequential vote they've taken in Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling the vote a deeply personal decision for members, said Democrats have no plans to whip members to vote for the articles.

They can only afford to lose 16-17 of the 233 Democrats to be able to pass the charges and formally impeach Trump.
Despite Republicans repeatedly warning Democrats in Trump districts they risk getting beaten in 2020, Democratic aides and leaders say privately they aren't worried about the vote, and expect just a handful of defections.

Still, some Democrats aren't showing their cards.

""I have made my way almost through the entire thing. I will read the rebuttal piece from the minority side. I've gone back and forth and looked at the House rules, I'm looking at the Nixon documents, the Clinton documents just to do what I was trained to do and make an objective decision based on what I think is right,"" Rep. Elisa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA officer and Pentagon official, told ABC News Live Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer.

Rep. Max Rose, a New York Democrat and Army veteran who represents deep-red Staten Island and slices of Brooklyn in Congress, said the vote will come down to ""showing integrity, trying to abide by and uphold my oath to the Constitution.""

""I'm not operating on anyone's timeline but my own,"" he told Dwyer when asked about making up his mind.
Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a U.S. Navy veteran who co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed with a group of House Democratic freshmen with national security experience in September that helped push the caucus towards impeachment over the Ukraine scandal, said she plans to vote for both articles.

""I've always said it was not a political decision it was about what was wrong and what was right,"" Luria, whose Virginia Beach district was carried by Trump in 2016, told reporters.

""If I don't get reelected in 2020 because of it I'll know that I did the right thing and was on the right side of history, and I'll be able to look at myself in the mirror.""
ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce caught up with New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottenheimer.

""Can you explain your current thinking? Why undecided right now?"" she asked.

""Because I made a commitment to my district from the moment that this began that I’m going to focus on all the facts,"" he said. ""I’m gonna read everything, watch all the testimony and the hearings, read the transcripts, consult with scholars, and then of course talk to my constituents, and then make an ultimate decision. But until the final articles are released and they make a…and the committee makes a recommendation, I think it is premature to make a decision. And that’s what I committed to my district that I would do – to read everything, to look at all the evidence, make an evidence-based and evidence-driven decision, and that’s what I plan to do.""
""What have you been hearing from your constituents?"" Bruce asked.

""Frankly, we hear both sides -- those who are for, those who are against this. But I’ve heard from all my constituents, I’ve heard from most of my constituents the same thing – please follow the facts. Make sure you put the Constitution first, don’t let politics play into this. Do what’s best for the country. That I’ve consistently heard. And to make sure that I don’t make a … don’t pre-judge. I think I’ve heard that all along. Don’t pre-judge. And frankly I’ve heard that from Democrats and Republicans – please make a decision based on … a fact-driven decision,"" Gottenheimer said.

Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York, who represents a Trump district, still hasn't made a decision.

""Right now I want to make sure the evidence fits these articles,"" he said.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, one of two Democrats to vote against the resolution launching the impeachment inquiry, said he and Rep. Colin Peterson of Minnesota still plan to oppose both impeachment articles, but only thinks a few Democrats will join them.

""I think it's been pretty static,"" he said. ""I wouldn't expect a huge number ... to vote no.""

Van Drew he's hearing from constituents on both sides of impeachment. The breakdown of calls to his office is about 50/50 on the issue, he said.

""Whatever you do, you are going to aggravate people,"" he said, adding that he had seen ""no"" new evidence or testimony that could persuade him to vote for impeachment.

Who's running for president in 2020?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/potential-2020-candidates-stand-midterms/story?id=59316177,"
Following Democrats' sweeping victories in the House of Representatives during the 2018 midterm elections, many in the party were eagerly anticipating the 2020 presidential election and the opportunity to unseat President Donald Trump.

The field of candidates remains large, even with candidates dropping out. In November, for example, two people who had earlier ruled out 2020 runs launched presidential campaigns.

Three Republican challengers also declared their intention to run, even as some state party officials were canceling their nominating contests. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford suspended his challenge to Trump in the Republican primary two months after announcing.

Here's a list of all the candidates in the race (in alphabetical order):

The senior senator from Colorado announced his presidential bid during a May 2 appearance on CBS This Morning, just weeks after a successful prostate cancer operation.

Bennet said his ability to win over Republican constituents and colleagues, and his ""broad"" experience in the public and private sectors, distinguish him in a crowded Democratic field.

""I think this country faces two enormous challenges, among others,"" he said in the CBS interview. ""One is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans, and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.""
Bennet caught people's attention with a viral speech on the Senate floor during the government shutdown in January. He tore into Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for the role he said he played during another government shutdown in 2013.

The former vice president and senator from Delaware announced his bid April 25 in an online video.

In the video, he denounced the white supremacists who marched on Charlottesville in 2017 and Trump's response, calling it a ""defining moment for this nation in the last few years.""

""We are in a battle for the soul of this nation,"" Biden said in the video.
Biden entered the race with the kind of name recognition that made him a de facto front-runner. But he's also faced questions about accusations from women about unwanted touching, money, messaging, age, identity and ideology in a political environment vastly different from the one he began his career in decades ago.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially entered the Democratic primary in November, launching an unconventional pursuit of the party’s presidential nomination after years of flirting with a bid for the nation's highest office.

""I offer myself as a doer and a problem solver -- not a talker. And as someone who is ready to take on the tough fights – and win,"" Bloomberg said in a statement on his website. ""Defeating Trump -- and rebuilding America -- is the most urgent and important fight of our lives. And I’m going all in.""

He made a pricey entrance into the race with an eight-figure television ad campaign and advertisements promoting his bio and taking direct aim at President Donald Trump.

His campaign launch, less than three months before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses, added more uncertainty into an already unsettled primary season.
The New Jersey senator and former mayor of Newark declared his candidacy on Feb. 1 after spending time last year campaigning for Democrats in Iowa, Nevada, South Carolina and Mississippi.

Booker has campaigned on a message of unity and collective action, promising to bring Democrats and Republicans together like he has on issues such as criminal justice reform during his time in the Senate.

""I think a lot of folks are beginning to feel that the forces that are tearing us apart in this country are stronger than the forces that tie us together. I don't believe that,"" Booker said on ABC's ""The View"" the day he announced his campaign. ""So, I'm running to restore our sense of common purpose, to focus on the common pain that we have all over this country.""
Buttigieg first made a national name for himself with a bid for Democratic National Committee chair in 2017. At 37 years old, he was the youngest candidate in the 2020 race, and could also become the first gay man to be elected president.

While he trailed many of his opponents in name recognition early on, Buttigieg argued that he could represent a generational shift in government, and speaks frequently of issues that will affect younger Americans, such as tax reform, gun control and climate change.
""I get the audacity of somebody like me talking about running for this office, but frankly it's a leap for anybody,"" Buttigieg said on ABC's ""This Week"" in February. ""And yet all of the people who had that job have been mortals who just bring their experience to the table. My experience is that of guiding a city through transformation, and I think a mayor at any level has the kind of executive frontline government experience and, by the way, problem-solving experience that we need more in Washington right now.""

Buttigieg officially entered the race on April 14 at a rally in his hometown of South Bend.

Castro, who served as mayor of San Antonio, Texas, before spending over two years in President Barack Obama's cabinet, announced his campaign in his hometown in January.

""I'm running for president because it's time for new leadership, because it's time for new energy, and it's time for a new commitment to make sure that the opportunities I've had are available for every American,"" he said.

In 2016, Castro was vetted by Hillary Clinton to be her running mate, but the spot ultimately went to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., This year, he said he is eager to restore the style of leadership the nation had under Obama.
The Maryland congressman was only seven months into his third term when he announced his candidacy in July 2017, becoming the first member of Congress to launch a bid in the 2020 cycle.

While Delaney, a millionaire entrepreneur and businessman before arriving in Congress, does not have the name recognition of the other likely candidates, he has already traveled to all of Iowa's 99 counties -- a right of passage for many caucus hopefuls -- and frequently discusses his pragmatic approach and desire to bridge political gaps.

""What the American people are really looking for is a leader to try to bring us together, not actually talk like half the country's entirely wrong about everything they believe,"" Delaney said on ABC's ""This Week"" in January, adding, ""One of the things I've pledged is in my first hundred days, only to do bipartisan proposals. Wouldn't it be amazing if a president looked at the American people at the inauguration and said, ‘I represent every one of you, whether you voted for me or not and this is how I'm going to prove it.'""
Democrat and Iraq War veteran Gabbard announced her presidential bid in January in an appearance on CNN.

""When we stand together, united by our love for each other and for our country, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. Will you join me?"" Gabbard tweeted.

Early on in her campaign, the first American Samoan and the first Hindu member of Congress faced questions over her work in the early 2000's for an anti-gay organization run by her father and her defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with whom she controversially met in 2017.
Klobuchar launched her campaign on a snowy February day in Minneapolis, laying out a platform that included a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizen's United Supreme Court decision, signing back on to the Paris climate agreement and advocating for criminal justice reform and universal health care.

""I'm running for every parent who wants a better world for their kids,"" Klobuchar said at her opening rally. ""I'm running for every student who wants a good education. For every senior who wants affordable prescription drugs. For every worker, farmer, dreamer, builder. For every American. I'm running for you.""

The Minnesota senator is viewed favorably by some in Democratic circles for her ability to perform strongly in her home state -- part of a Midwestern region that helped President Trump to victory in 2016.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick
Patrick, the former two-term governor of Massachusetts and the state's first black chief executive, formally announced a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in a sharp reversal from his 2018 decision to not pursue a run -- injecting more uncertainty into an unsettled primary less than three months before the first votes.

""I've had the chance to live my American dream,"" he said in a November announcement video. ""But over the years, I've seen the path to that dream closing off bit by bit. The anxiety and even anger that I saw in my neighbors on the South Side, the sense that the government and the economy were letting us down, were no longer about us, is what folks feel all over America today in all kinds of communities.""
Following his announcement, he traveled to New Hampshire and filed paperwork to appear on the primary ballot. It was a day before the deadline to file.

While in Manchester, New Hampshire, he told ABC News' Whit Johnson, ""I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think I could win it.""

After a 2016 campaign that saw him amass millions of supporters even as he finished second to Clinton, Sanders entered the 2020 race in February, predicting victory and pointing to the progressive ideas he had championed as an outsider during the last cycle, like ""Medicare for All"" and free college tuition, that have since become increasingly mainstream.

In an email to supporters announcing the launch of his campaign, Sanders further took aim at Trump, using some of the starkest language of a Democratic candidate up to that point.

""You know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history,"" he wrote. ""We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction.""
Tom Steyer
Tom Steyer, a billionaire liberal activist from California, in July became the 26th major Democratic figure to enter the 2020 race, reversing course on a statement he made months earlier saying he wouldn't run.

Steyer has poured millions of his own money into electing Democrats throughout the years, and said in January that he would redouble his efforts to impeach the president instead of seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. But in a tweet following his presidential campaign announcement, he conceded that his efforts to ""hold the president accountable"" are ""not enough.""

In his four-minute announcement video, Steyer unveiled a campaign platform that focused on curbing the influence of corporations in politics and combating climate change.

""Really what we're doing is make democracy work by pushing power down to the people,"" he said.
President Donald Trump
On the same day he assumed the office of the presidency in 2017, Trump filed preliminary paperwork with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) to qualify as a presidential candidate for 2020.

Trump's re-election campaign announced in early April that it raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, a total that outpaces all of his Democratic rivals and indicates he will be well-resourced in his bid for a second term in the Oval Office.
""Our prodigious fundraising is further proof of President Trump's clear record of accomplishment on behalf of the American people,"" wrote Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Trump's re-election campaign.

Conservative firebrand former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announced in August on ABC's ""This Week"" that he's launching a long-shot Republican presidential primary challenge against the president.

When ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos pointed out the massive uphill climb Walsh has in front of him in the primary thanks to Trump's overwhelmingly high approval rating within the party, the controversial former congressman argued that conservatives should have an alternative to the president.
""I'm running because he's unfit; somebody needs to step up and there needs to be an alternative. The country is sick of this guy's tantrum -- he's a child,"" said Walsh, who was elected to the House in the 2010 Tea Party wave, but only served one term before becoming a conservative talk radio host.

The former Illinois congressman-turned-radio host was once a fervent Trump supporter but has become a fierce critic of the president. Walsh was the second Republican to jump into the primary to challenge Trump.

After establishing a presidential exploratory committee just before New Year's, Warren officially joined the race in February with an event in Massachusetts.

""This is the fight of our lives,"" the senator said. ""The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.""

A prolific fundraiser whose staffers spent time in a number of early primary states assisting other Democrats, Warren said in September that following the midterms she would ""take a hard look at running for president,"" becoming one of the first major names to take steps towards a run.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced in April that he's officially running for president, becoming the first Republican to mount a primary challenge against the president.

Weld, a current partner at the Mintz Levin law firm and the 2016 vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, said he would have been ""ashamed"" if he passed on running against Trump for the Republican party nomination.
""I'd be ashamed of myself if hadn't raised my hand and said, 'Count me in,'"" he told ABC News shortly after his announcement. ""I think that the president is a very divisive force and that's just not my style, and it's not what Americans deserve.""

Author Marianne Williamson announced the launch of her campaign in Los Angeles in January after making six trips to Iowa and one to New Hampshire over the past year as she explored a bid.

Williamson is best known outside of political circles as the author of several popular self-help books and as a ""spiritual friend and counselor"" to Oprah Winfrey, with multiple appearances on her show and television network.

She also ran to represent California's 33rd congressional district in 2014 as an independent, finishing fourth in the open primary, after endorsements from then-Rep. Keith Ellison, former Govs. Jennifer Granholm and Jesse Ventura, and former Reps. Dennis Kucinich and Alan Grayson.
Yang, an entrepreneur, is running a presidential campaign most commonly noted for its support of universal basic income -- a pledge to provide all Americans 18 and older with $1,000 per month.

Yang speaks frequently about both income inequality and the economic transformation that has enriched certain parts of the country while disproportionately harming regions that have failed to keep pace.
""I was stunned when I saw the disparities between Detroit and San Francisco or Cleveland and Manhattan. You feel like you're traveling across dimensions and decades and not just a couple of time zones,"" Yang told ""Rolling Stone"" in January. ""None of our political leaders are willing to acknowledge the elephant in the room that is tearing our communities apart, in the form of technological change.""

The following candidates have dropped out of the 2020 election:

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is most notably known for winning in 2016 as a Democrat in a state that helped elect Trump.

""As a Democratic governor in a state Trump won by 20 points, I don't have the luxury of only talking to people who agree with me,"" Bullock said in his May announcement video. ""I go all across our state's 147 thousand square miles and look for common ground to get things done.""
He campaigned for 202 days, but failed to gain traction at the national level, did not reach 2% in any of the Democratic National Committee qualifying polls and only made one debate stage. He suspended his campaign on Dec. 2 and said in a statement, ""While there were many obstacles we could not have anticipated when entering this race, it has become clear that in this moment, I won’t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field of candidates.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio
New York City's mayor released a video on Youtube, announcing his campaign launch on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

De Blasio, who is in his second term, joined a crowded field of nearly two dozen Democrats in the race for the White House. The central theme of de Blasio's campaign was ""working people first.""
On Sept. 20, de Blasio announced he was dropping out of the race. The mayor struggled in the polls and did not qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates, hosted by ABC News.

""Getting out there, being able to hear people's concerns, address them with new ideas has been an extraordinary experience,"" he said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""But I have to tell you, at the same time I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election and it's clearly not my time. So I'm gonna end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I'm gonna keep speaking up for working people.""

The New York Democrat formally announced her presidential run on March 17 in a video posted to her verified YouTube account. In January, she had announced that she was forming a presidential exploratory committee during an appearance on CBS' ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""

""I'm going to run for president of the United States because, as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own,"" she said during the interview.

On Aug. 28, Gillibrand announced she was ending her presidential campaign. In a video posted to her Twitter account, Gillibrand thanked her supporters and made a call to action to defeat Trump and secure a Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate.

""We wanted to win this race, but it's important to know when it's not your time, and to know how you can best serve your community and country,"" she said. ""I believe I can best serve by helping to unite us to beat Donald Trump in 2020.""
Mike Gravel's unlikely bid for president was launched by two teenagers who learned about him through a podcast and encouraged the former Alaska senator to run for president in 2020.

Having failed to make the debate stage during the first two Democratic debates, Gravel's team decided to close up shop on their campaign and redirect their efforts towards a think tank. In a video posted to Twitter, he endorsed Sanders for president.

His campaign was being transitioned into a progressive think tank called the Gravel Institute.
Following months of speculation surrounding the junior senator from California, Harris officially announced her 2020 candidacy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in January.

""I love my country. I love my country,"" she said. ""This is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to stand up and fight for the best of who we are.""

If Harris were to win the 2020 presidential election, she would have become the first woman and woman of color to ascend to the nation's highest office. However, she announced the suspension of her presidential bid in December.

""My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,"" she said in an email statement to her supporters. ""I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.""
Hickenlooper joined the field in early March, seeking to parlay his success in growing Colorado's economy while passing environmental regulations and gun control laws into a successful presidential campaign. In a launch video, he spoke further of healing the nation's political divisions.

""One thing I've shown I can do, again and again, is create teams of amazingly talented people and really address these issues that are the critical issues facing this country,"" he said on ""Good Morning America.""

He also announced he was suspending his campaign with a video.

""While this campaign didn't have the outcome we were hoping for, every moment has been worthwhile and I'm thankful to everyone who supported this campaign and our entire team,"" he said in the video posted to Twitter.
Inslee became the first sitting governor to join the presidential field when he kicked off his campaign in early March.

The Washington governor is currently serving his second term in Olympia after more than two decades as a member of Congress, and said that while he is proud of efforts to raise the state's minimum wage and increase access to early childhood education, his presidential bid would prioritize climate change, which he labeled an ""existential threat"" during his launch event.

On Aug. 21, he announced on MSNBC that he was dropping out of the race.

""It's become clear that I'm not going to be carrying the ball, but we're going to make sure somebody is,"" he said in the interview.
Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam
The little-known Florida mayor joined the growing list of 2020 presidential candidates, announcing his candidacy on March 28 despite facing an uphill climb for his bid.

He announced that he was suspending his presidential campaign on Nov. 20 in a tweet.

""I am Suspending My 2020 Presidential Campaign But I’m Not Finished Yet,"" he posted on the morning of the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.

Messam is currently the chief executive of a city of 140,000 residents -- more than the population of the city Buttigieg runs in Indiana. He is known by many Floridians for playing football for Florida State University in the 1990s.
Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.
Rep. Seth Moulton, a 40-year-old Democrat from Massachusetts,  formally announced his presidential bid in April on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

Moulton, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, is known as an outspoken critic of his own party. He was elected to the House in 2013.

During the 2018 midterms, Moulton raised more than $4 million through his Serve America PAC to support Democratic candidates running in battleground states. Before announcing his candidacy, he had already laid groundwork for his 2020 campaign, having visited Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada.
On Aug. 23, Moulton dropped out of the race. He told The New York Times, ""I think it's evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders, and really it's a debate about how far the left wing party should go."" He will seek re-election in the House to represent the 6th district of Massachusetts, according to The Times.

O'Rourke announced an end to his presidential campaign via Twitter on Nov. 1.

""Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,"" he wrote.
He rose national prominence during his unsuccessful run against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and officially announced his presidential campaign in mid-March, calling it ""a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.""

Within days, O'Rourke's campaign announced it raised over $6.1 million in the first 24 hours following his announcement, topping Sen. Bernie Sanders' previous high-water mark of $5.9 million.
Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio
The Ohio Democrat, who announced his candidacy on ABC's ""The View"" on April 4, billed himself as someone who could unify the progressive wings of the Democratic Party with the more middle-of-the-road working-class voters.

Ryan, a more moderate voice in the crowded field of competitors, rose to the national political stage in 2016 when he launched a failed bid to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as House minority leader. He had previously been floated as a potential candidate in the 2014 Ohio gubernatorial election.

On Oct. 24, he posted a video to announce that he was withdrawing from the presidential campaign.

""While it didn’t work out quite the way we planned, this voice will not be stifled,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""I will continue to advocate and fight for the working people of this country -- white, black, brown, men, women.""
Former governor and Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.
Former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford announced on Sept. 8 that he would challenge the president in the 2020 Republican primary.

""We have a storm coming that we are neither talking about nor preparing for given that we, as a country, are more financially vulnerable than we have ever been since our Nation's start and the Civil War. We are on a collision course with financial reality,"" he posted on Twitter, outlining his reasons for running.

Two months later, in November, he suspended his bid, telling reporters, ""Based on the impossibility of trying to raise the issues I’ve been trying to raise which is debt, deficit, government spending in the midst of an impeachment. So call me a casualty of the impeachment process."" He added that he felt it was impossible to get meaningful debate on anything because of partisan fighting over the impeachment inquiry process.

Sanford's tenure as South Carolina governor was rocked by scandal in 2009 after he secretly traveled to Argentina to meet with his lover, Buenos Aires resident Maria Belen Chapur. He confessed to having an extramarital affair in a news conference after his return. He finished his term as governor and was elected to Congress several years later.

Former Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa.
Sestak, a former Pennsylvania congressman and a retired three-star admiral in the U.S. Navy, dropped out of the race on Dec. 1. He entered the field at the onset of the first presidential debates in June, despite never qualifying for one.

""I know there is a tear in that fabric right now; but it can be repaired by someone who can lead, and therefore unite, all Americans,"" Sestak wrote in a Twitter post announcing the end of his candidacy.

Sestak began his career in the Navy in 1974, before becoming the highest-ranking military officer ever elected to Congress in 2007, according to his campaign website. He served in the House until 2011.

In 2016, he competed in the Democratic primary to unseat Sen. Pat Toomey in a tough battleground race but was defeated by Democratic rival Katie McGinty.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
The California congressman and vocal critic of the president, Swalwell officially launched his bid for the Democratic nomination on April 8. Swalwell, who stopped in several early-voting states during the leadup to his announcement, was rooting his campaign's agenda in the issue of gun control. Following his formal announcement, he held a town hall in Sunrise, Florida, with Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and families.
""I'm telling folks, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns, keep your pistols, we just want the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people,"" Swalwell told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" on April 9. ""Most gun owners believe that.""

On July 8, he became the first of the more than 20 Democratic nominees to drop out of the race.

""I ran for President to win and make a difference in our great country,"" Swalwell wrote in a news release. ""I promised my family, constituents, and supporters that I would always be honest about our chances. After the first Democratic presidential debate, our polling and fundraising numbers weren't what we had hoped for, and I no longer see a path forward to the nomination."""
Meghan McCain on Haley's confederate flag remarks,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meghan-mccain-nikki-haleys-opposing-confederate-flag-comments/story?id=67686387,"
Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley sparked controversy this month when she seemingly contradicted her position on the Confederate flag and made comments shining it in a positive light. On ""The View"" Thursday, the co-hosts condemned her position.

Haley, who was also the governor of South Carolina, called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state's capitol building in the wake of the June 17, 2015, massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. On that day, nine people attending a bible study were killed by Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death in 2017, making it the first instance in which the death penalty was given for a federal hate crimes case. The confederate flag was removed from the state capitol on July 10, 2015.
Earlier this month, however, Haley said in an interview with The Blaze's ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" that the Confederate flag was about ""service, and sacrifice and heritage"" until the Charleston Church shooting ""hijacked everything that people thought of"" the flag.

Haley has defended her position on the Confederate flag, and on Wednesday, she wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post asserting that her position on the flag ""has been constant"" and that it is America's culture that has changed.

""The View"" co-hosts Meghan McCain and Sunny Hostin criticized her stance on the Confederate flag.

McCain said that Haley's comments during her interview with The Blaze seemed ""very bizarre"" and her position on the subject was ""strange.""

McCain went on to say that the issue of flying the Confederate flag is a ""very, very deep issue"" for her family because of the backlash her late father Senator John McCain received after he agreed that the flag should be flown above the South Carolina capitol in 1999. She said that his support for that became one of the biggest mistakes of his life and that ""plagued him up until the day he died.""
""He had two big life regrets, this is one of them,"" McCain said of her father. ""It haunted him, this will haunt her. It will, trust me.""

The Arizona senator later renounced his comments on flying the flag.

""I don't understand why we're still debating the Confederate flag,"" McCain added. ""It's a symbol of racism...it's not about what people like me think.""

Hostin chimed in, saying Haley's comments should disqualify her from running for national office.

""She's now tried to diminish the very oppression of my community, of my ancestors, by calling it 'outrage.' Well, I am outraged by that position,"" she said.

""For [Nikki Haley] to somehow say that people think that the Confederate flag is about service, and it's about heritage -- It is about slavery, it is about the oppression of black people"" Hostin continued. ""Nothing more and she knows that. She knows that, and she should never run for national office.""

McCain agreed with Hostin's perspective, saying that Haley ""does know better"" than to make those assertions about the flag. She also said she believes the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is ""clearly"" planning to run for president in 2024.

""It's very evident that she thinks Trump is the wave of the future and in order to do it [she's] going to need his supporters,"" McCain said.

""There's a lot of young conservative women in the country that are not going to get on board with it,"" she continued, ""and defending the Confederate flag is Exhibit A of the best way to get people like me fleeing.""

Hostin doubled down on her stance that Haley shouldn't run for office, saying that Haley also doesn't have the qualities of a leader.

""These are not the actions or the words of a leader,"" Hostin said. ""A leader is someone who stands on morality, stands on conviction, doesn't speak out of both sides of her mouth. She is just, quite simply, not a leader.""

"Cabinet secretary, Medicare chief summoned to White House to resolve feud: Sources",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feuding-cabinet-secretary-medicare-administrator-summoned-white-house/story?id=67667111,"
President Donald Trump’s health secretary and his top Medicare administrator have been summoned to the White House by acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney for a meeting this week after heated tensions between the two high-ranking officials boiled over and a string of embarrassing media leaks, according to several sources familiar with the details.

The apparent feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has become a major distraction for the Trump administration, which has struggled to deliver on its promised overhaul on health care -- and it's raising serious questions about who the president will rely on to carry his message on the topic ahead of the 2020 election.
According to one administration source, there’s no plan yet to reshuffle the decks of leadership at HHS. But the meeting led by Mulvaney is akin to being called into the principal’s office in a bid to resolve their long-running dispute that several people say has grown increasingly ugly.
The administration source said that Azar and Verma have been told previously, in separate settings, to knock it off. The president, the vice president, and the vice president's chief of staff have also all previously relayed the same message, the official said.

Sources familiar with the feud tell ABC News that Azar and Verma have been at odds over the direction of health care policy under Trump, who campaigned on a promise to “repeal and replace” President Barack Obama’s health care law. Now, both are vying for a green light from the White House to move ahead with their ideas and sway national policy.
An HHS spokesperson said in a statement the two are working together and have made progress on key issues like pricing transparency.
“Secretary Azar’s and Administrator Verma’s top priority is to advance the President’s healthcare agenda through lowering drug costs, advancing competition in the marketplace, and ensuring Americans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement released to the press.
Mulvaney's office declined to comment.

Verma -- a former health care consultant from Indiana -- arrived at HHS as CMS chief at the start of the administration with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence.

Azar didn’t take the helm of HHS until after Trump’s first health secretary, Tom Price, resigned. And as a former pharmaceutical executive who worked as a top health official during the George W. Bush administration, Azar is seen by some as more of an outsider than Verma, although he is considered to have a close working relationship with Pence as well.

As Azar and Verma sparred internally on health care, Politico reported that Verma had spent more than $2 million in a one-year public relations contract that was aimed at raising her public profile. An internal watchdog office at HHS has confirmed it’s investigating the contracts upon a request by House Democrats.
This past weekend, Politico reported a lost property claim filed by Verma in August 2018 with HHS after items she was traveling with were stolen from her luggage during a work-related trip. According to documents obtained by Politico under the Freedom of Information Act, the form listed $47,000 in jewelry and other property, including a $5,900 Ivanka Trump-brand pendant. She was reimbursed by the federal agency for $2,852.

A spokesperson for Verma said she first inquired about recovering the loss with her own insurance company but was told to file a claim through her employer because the items were stolen during a work trip. The law allows federal employees to file claims for stolen property while on duty. The spokesman also said the administrator was instructed to include a “full inventory” of all items in her luggage.

“At her own expense the Administrator travels to Washington, DC from Indiana each week to work at CMS, which was why she was traveling with her personal collection of jewelry,” the spokesman said.

The CMS spokesman attributed the leaks to a “smear campaign” against Verma’s work.

“These recent leaks and gossip are part of a targeted campaign to smear the Administrator and undermine the accomplishments of CMS and the Administration,” the spokesman said. “The Administrator’s number one priority is continuing to deliver on the President’s bold healthcare agenda to ensure Americans have access to high quality, affordable health care.”

At least one House Democrat, Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, has called for her resignation in the wake of both her filed claim on the lost jewelry and steering more than $2 million to public relations contracts.

“We have now seen a systemic effort by the administrator to use public funds to elevate her own position,” Kennedy told Politico.

Melania Trump makes annual holiday visit to children's hospital to read to patients,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lady-melania-trump-makes-annual-holiday-visit-childrens/story?id=67547033,"
First lady Melania Trump continued a nearly 70-year-long tradition Friday when she made her annual visit to Children’s National Hospital where she met with patients, their families and nursing staff before reading them a children’s book.

She is the latest in a long line of first ladies to visit the Washington, D.C. hospital, starting with Elizabeth ""Bess"" Truman, the wife of former President Harry Truman, over 60 years ago. Other first ladies who have participated in the tradition are: Jacqueline Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt and more recently, Michelle Obama.

During her visit, Trump stopped in a play room to visit with the young patients and participate in an art project centered on the upcoming Christmas holiday.
She spent extra time crafting with three children in particular: 8-year-old Brooke Hilton, 7-year-old Nathalia Vasseur Hoffman and 8-year-old Dwayne Salmon, to whom she offered words of advice and encouragement.

""Hi sweetheart, how are you feeling?” Trump asked Hilton. She continued to make small talk, asking the children when she walked in if they were ”Feeling strong?”

The first lady then went on to ask if they had written to Santa yet.

“He’s so busy right now,” Trump said of Santa Claus. “You should write him this weekend.”
The children spent time reading quotes to her from Dr. Suess’ ""Oh, the places you’ll go!""

After spending some time making paper snowflakes, the first lady and the children made their way to the main stage to join the crowd and commence the book reading.

This year, Trump read ""Oliver the Ornament Meets Belle,"" the sequel to ""Oliver the Ornament,"" which she read last year.
""Oliver the Ornament"" is a seven-book series that celebrates the tradition and stories of Christmas ornaments. The story focuses on a little ornament who faces challenges, but is able to overcome all odds to save the day.

Joining Trump on stage were none other than Mr. and Mrs. Claus, as well as the book’s author, Todd Zimmerman.

Since launching ""Oliver the Ornament,"" Zimmerman has donated over 3,000 copies of the book to hospitalized children and will be donating a percentage of profits from all books sold to various children’s charities.

Trump also toured the Surgical Care Unit and the Short Stay Unit to visit with patients, their families and the nursing staff.

Democrats call Trump 'clear and present danger' at Judiciary impeachment hearing,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judiciary-committee-trump-impeachment-hearing-live-updates/story?id=67581755,"
The House Judiciary Committee on Monday heard  closing arguments for and against President Donald Trump's impeachment, setting off a busy two weeks on Capitol Hill expected to end with a House floor vote on the charges ahead of Christmas.

As they prepare to release articles of impeachment against Trump as early as this week, Democratic lawmakers called attorneys from the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees to present evidence from the Democrats' Ukraine investigation and to argue   that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically.
Republican lawyers from the same House panels argued against Democrats' impeachment efforts and defended the president's actions toward Ukraine at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

Here is how the hearing unfolded.

Chairman Jerry Nadler adjourns the hearing close to ten hours after it began.

In his closing statement, Nadler says, ""We know that President Trump has put himself before his country.""

Republicans offered ""not one substantive word in the president's defense,"" he continues.

""The fact are clear. The danger to our democracy is clear and our duty is clear,"" he says.

""President Trump violated his oath to the American people and placed his own private interests ahead of our national security, and constitutes a threat to our election and government.

""Such conduct is impeachable,"" he says as he closes. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler adjourns hearing close to 10 hours after it began:  ""We know that Pres. Trump has put himself before his country,"" Nadler said in his closing statement https://t.co/37xFo8BakV pic.twitter.com/xzPymS1PYZ— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

Ranking Member Doug Collins, in his closing statement, says, ""At the end of the day, the case isn't made.""

""This is the first impeachment that is partisan on facts that are not agreed to,"" he says, referring to as an ""impeachment scam"" one last time.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and strong ally of the president, said Democrats were pursuing impeachment and ignoring the needs of the American people.

""The last public opinion poll showed Congress had an approval rating at about nine percent. By contrast Muammar Gaddafi had an approval rating at 13 percent, and his own people dragged him into the streets and killed him,"" Gaetz said, of the Libyan dictator.
""This impeachment process demonstrates the worst in us and it is depriving us the opportunity to raise our gaze and meet the needs of the American people,"" he said.

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., followed Gaetz's remarks by defending the impeachment efforts and House Democrats' legislative record this year.

""We were also elected to hold this president accountable,"" he said. ""That’s what we’re engaged in today.""

In his line of questioning, Ranking Member Rep. Doug Collins repeatedly asked Goldman, the Democrats' investigator, to explain why Democrats sought phone records between members of Congress and journalists as part of the investigation.

The report released by the House Intelligence Committee showed multiple calls between the top Republican on that committee Rep. Devin Nunes and Rudy Giuliani.
Goldman declined to give details on how Democrats conducted the investigation.

""I am going to go on record and tell you I'm not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,"" Goldman said.

Collins implied Goldman doesn't want to answer because it would incriminate himself or Schiff and that Schiff should have been the one to testify.

""You're here without a pin because your chairman will not testify. That says all we need to hear. He doesn't stand behind his report so he sends you,"" Collins said, referencing the pins worn by members of Congress.

Collins also referenced a part of Goldman's testimony earlier in the day when he referenced Sondland's donation to the president's inauguration, which Sondland testified was to help secure a ticket to the event. Collins noted that Goldman has donated money to Democrats.

When Goldman asked Collins what he was implying about his personal role, Rep. Matt Gaetz interjected to say ""the point is, we want Mr. Schiff in that chair, not you.""

Goldman asked to be given time to respond but Nadler did not interject and Collins handed over questioning to Republican Counsel Ashley Hurt Callen.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders and Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room note more fireworks during the first round of questioning.

Democratic Counsel Barry Berke has been aggressively questioning Republican Counsel Steve Castor and this time the interruption came from GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner.

Berke was questioning Castor about Jennifer Williams, the aide to Vice President Mike Pence, calling President Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's President Zelensky ""unusual.""

He accused Castor and Republicans of inaccurately representing Williams’ description of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call, as part of a larger batch of questions casting aspersions on the GOP report.

“Do you have an explanation, sir, where you said Ms. Williams said that the call was unusual when, in fact, she said it was unusual and inappropriate and of a political nature?” Berke asked.

“We described what Ms. Williams said,” Castor replied.

“No you didn’t,” Berke shot back.

After a number of contentious exchanges with Castor, Berke has periodically returned to Goldman to underscore his points.

“Is it important to be fair to the American people to accurately report what they said?” Berke asked him before questioning Castor about Williams.

“Of course,” he replied.

Nadler then shot back and said that sharp cross examination of a witness is not badgering.""The lawyer is badgering the witness,"" Rep. Sensenbrenner objects during one of multiple GOP interruptions of impeachment hearing. ""We have to have some decorum in here.""""Sharp cross-examination of a witness is not badgering the witness,"" Nadler says. https://t.co/nPeZz2wMi8 pic.twitter.com/uCPeXJ3dOj— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019

""We have to have some decorum in here.""""Sharp cross-examination of a witness is not badgering the witness,"" Nadler says. https://t.co/nPeZz2wMi8 pic.twitter.com/uCPeXJ3dOj
In another testy back-and-forth, Castor suggested Trump wasn't asking for a Biden investigation.

""Was the president requesting an investigation into Joe Biden?"" Berke asked.

""I don't think the president was asking for an investigation into Joe Biden. It was just a comment,"" Castor said dismissively.

Then, questioning Goldman, Berke pointed out that Trump was prepared to discuss corruption on the call via White House talking points, but did not mention it once.

""Did he mention looking into anything other than the two investigations that were politically helpful to him, the 2016 election investigation and the investigation of his political rival, former vice President Joe Biden?"" Berke asked.

""No, he did not,"" Goldman said.

Castor also argues that Democrats don't have a case for obstruction of justice charges against the president because the administration has released transcripts of the July 25 call and the earlier call between Trump and Zelenskiy and allowed U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland to testify.

Even so, the White House has refused to cooperate with the inquiry in other ways by declining to provide documents and blocking other administration officials from testifying.
""The report presents a story as if the evidence is clear when, in reality, it's anything but,"" Castor says as he wraps up his statement.

After Castor's presentation, the committee has started the extended round of questions. Nadler and Collins, along with their counsels, will have up to 45 minutes each to question the witnesses.

Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, tried to object to the fact that Berke, who presented on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, is now seated at Nadler's side for this round pf questioning.

""I know that you don’t get to be a witness and judge in the same case,"" Gohmert, a former judge who has accused Democrats of orchestrating a ""coup,"" shouted at Nadler.

""That's not a point of order,"" Nadler replied.

As the hearing resumes, Steve Castor is now making his second opening statement in his role representing Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.

He's summarizing the report they produced that found no evidence the president committed an impeachable offense.

""The inquiry has returned no direct evidence that President Trump withheld a meeting or security assistance in order to pressure President Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Biden. 
Witnesses who testified in the inquiry have denied having awareness of criminal activity or even an impeachable offense,"" Castor says.
The committee is in a short recess.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders tweets out a letter from Chairman Nadler to Ranking Member Collins saying there is no need for the GOP's requested witnesses since President Trump isn’t requesting any. Nadler also says there is no need for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to appear.

Even after Nadler has denied Republican requests to hold a hearing with their own witnesses, including, they're not letting go of that talking point.

During the break a new sign appeared on the Republican side of the dais with Schiff's face on a milk carton. It reads ""Missing"" and says ""if found contact Jerry Nadler."" according to Faulders and ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room.And....a new sign. pic.twitter.com/fBazuUdPsh— Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) December 9, 2019

   And....a new sign. pic.twitter.com/fBazuUdPsh
The committee is now hearing summations of the evidence from both sides, starting with the Director of Investigations for the House Intelligence Committee, Daniel Goldman.

He'll be followed by the Republican presentation.
""We are here today because Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, abused the power of his office—the American presidency—for his personal political benefit."" Goldman says.

""President Trump directed a months-long scheme to solicit foreign help in his 2020 reelection campaign, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political interference in our domestic affairs,"" he begins.

Republican Counsel Steve Castor presents the counterargument to Berke's conclusions, saying he would provide context to support that the evidence does not support Democrats' allegations.

""Overall, at best, the impeachment inquiry record is riddled with hearsay, presumptions, and speculation. There are conflicting and ambiguous facts throughout the record—facts that could be interpreted in different ways,"" Castor says in his opening statement.
""The record in the Democrats impeachment inquiry does not show that President Trump abused the power of his office or obstructed Congress. To impeach a president who 63 million people voted for -- over eight lines in a call transcript -- is baloney,"" he says.

He argues that Democrats' haven't proven Trump acted with malicious intent in his dealings with Ukraine and cited comments from President Zelenskiy that he did not feel pressured on the July 25 call.Minority counsel Steve Castor: ""The purpose of this hearing, as we understand it, is to discuss whether President Donald J.

Castor also cites testimony from legal experts last week, specifically from George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, who raised concerns Democrats are pushing for impeachment too quickly to fully build a case and pursue more information.

""The artificial and arbitrary political deadline by which Democrats are determined to finish impeachment by Christmas leads to a rushed process. And missed opportunities to obtain relevant information,"" Castor said.
Barry Berke, the majority counsel for the Judiciary Committee, argues the evidence collected in the impeachment inquiry so far shows President Trump's behavior fits the description of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and constitutes an impeachable offense.
Berke specifically says the president abused his power, betrayed the national interest, and took actions that would compromise American elections.

""The scheme by President Trump so brazen, so clear, supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted, contemporaneous records, that it's hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses. This is a big deal. President Trump did what a president of our nation is not allowed to do,"" he says.

ABC News' Katherine Faulders in the hearing room reports: The overwhelming theme from Democratic Counsel Berke was this: President Trump thought he got away with the Ukraine scheme. He used his powers to interfere with the investigation, but then he got caught. And his abuse of power is an impeachable offense.

Berke played multiple clips of the president, including one where Trump said: ""Then I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president,"" referring to the Constitution.

Berke said that the president's ""excuse"" is that the military aid to Ukraine was ultimately released but Berke argue the aid was released only ""after President Trump got caught doing the scheme.""

""He put his political re-election interests over the nation's national security and the integrity of its election. He did it intentionally. He did it corruptly. He abused his powers in ways that the founders feared most. No person in this country has the ability to prevent investigations and neither does the president,"" Berke says.

Ranking Member Rep. Doug Collins continues to attack Democrats' for pursuing a predetermined outcome in the impeachment inquiry, saying they have already decided to vote to impeach President Trump.

""For anyone to think that this was not a baked deal is not being honest with themselves,"" he says in his opening statement.

Collins also criticizes Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, saying he should have to testify directly on the motivations and process behind his committee's report instead of sending staff.

Collins said he's seriously concerned about the political motivations behind the impeachment proceedings and repeated criticism from President Trump that Schiff dramatized a reading of the transcript of the July 25 call at the heart of the inquiry.

""I love this institution, but in the last three days -- over the last three or four days I have seen stuff that just bother me to no end and should bother everyone,"" Collins said, citing Speak Nancy Pelosi's direction to draft impeachment articles after last week's hearing.

""At the end of the day, all this is about is about a clock and a calendar. Because they can't get over the fact Donald Trump is president of the United States and they don't have a candidate that they think can beat him. It's all political. And as we have talked about before, this is a show,"" he adds.Rep.

As he gets back to his opening statement, Nadler cites testimony from constitutional experts from last week's hearing, setting up the Democrats' argument that President Trump's behavior exactly fulfills the type of abuse of power the framers had in mind when the laid out the process for impeachment.

""As we heard in our last hearing, the framers of the Constitution were careful students of history and clear in their vision for the new nation. They knew that threats to democracy can take many forms, that we must protect against them,"" Nadler says.

""The debates around the framing make clear that the most serious such offenses include abuse of power, betrayal of the nation through foreign entanglements and corruption of public office,"" he continues.

""Any one of these violations of the public trust would compel the members of this committee to take action. When combined, in a single course of action, they state the strongest possible case for impeachment and removal from office,"" he says.

The New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, gavels the hearing into session at 9:08 a.m.

Republicans raise an objection within seconds of Nadler beginning his opening statement, setting the stage for more objections to come.

A protester starts shouting from the back of the room, interrupting Nadler: ""Jerry Nadler, you're the one committing treason"" and ""We voted for Donald Trump."" Capitol Police quickly remove him.

The hearing is set to begin at 9 a.m. but relatively few committee members are in the room.

Republicans have set up a large sign with the words ""Where's Adam?"" in white letters against a black background, signaling their displeasure that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will not be testifying as they wanted. They have repeatedly accused him of lying about whether he knew and coordinated with the intelligence community whistleblower who triggered the impeachment probe.

ABC's Mary Bruce reports this might the last chance Democrats have to persuade the American public on such a nationally-televised scale before a vote on articles of impeachment.

ABC's Benjamin Siegel and Allison Pecorin report a Democratic official told reporters over the weekend that Democrats intend to use this hearing to make their ""theory of the case"" against President Donald Trump and his abuse of power.

Democrats, according to the official, plan to argue today that Trump's use of his office for personal political gain ahead of the election represents the ""framers' nightmare,"" by acting in a way that ""betrays our national security and corrupts our elections using a foreign power.""

They will argue that Trump's actions were part of a ""repeated pattern,"" and that the Ukraine episode is important because it represents a ""future pattern,"" highlighting the urgency of moving quickly to impeach the president ahead of the 2020 election.

As members start to take their seats in the hearing room, ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is facing a difficult challenge making the final call on how broad articles of impeachment will be.

She says Pelosi has to be especially mindful of the views of Democrats in swing districts.

GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, tells ABC News' Tom Llamas that there is no evidence of any impeachable conduct, that Democrats can't point to any ""crimes committed.""

""This whole thing has been a farce,"" she says.

Democratic members and aides spent the weekend in Washington preparing for the upcoming hearings. Judiciary Committee Democratic staff also released a report highlighting the historical and legal arguments behind their impeachment efforts against Trump.
On Saturday, they huddled with Harvard Law School professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, who's been advising the caucus throughout the impeachment process. They also prepared for the upcoming hearing in the stately Longworth Office Building hearing room, which has hosted weeks of public impeachment proceedings.

Working with committee and leadership staff behind closed doors, they prepared their questions for Monday's hearing, with former Hill staffers playing the roles of committee Republicans, according to sources familiar with the preparations.

They also discussed the potential charges against Trump, which they're expected to introduce and approve in the Judiciary Committee later this week.
""We need to make it clear within those articles that there is a pattern of conduct here, that Ukraine was the most egregious example of the president abusing his office while he was president of the United States, shaking down a foreign nation to interfere in our elections,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said Sunday. ""We need to be focused, we need to be clear, we need to present the best possible case if we are moving in this direction.""
In an interview with CNN Sunday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., did not commit to including evidence of obstruction of justice from special counsel Robert Mueller's report in the forthcoming articles.

""We have a very rock-solid case,"" Nadler said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""I think the case we have, if presented to a jury, would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat.""
House Republicans are expected to argue that the Democrats' case falls short, that they lack sufficient firsthand evidence to conclusively charge Trump with abusing his power and undermining U.S. national security in his dealings with Ukraine.

In requests for additional witnesses and information, they have outlined a potential GOP strategy for a Senate impeachment trial that could focus on former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine, as well as the intelligence community whistleblower behind the complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry.

Wednesday's impeachment hearing: What to watch for,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/watch-wednesdays-impeachment-hearing/story?id=67449058,"
Some of President Donald Trump’s fiercest critics and defenders on Capitol Hill return to the spotlight Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds its first hearing in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.
On Wednesday morning, the panel will hear testimony from constitutional scholars just hours after the House Intelligence Committee released its report Tuesday evening into whether Trump improperly ordered military aid to Ukraine withheld to pressure the country to launch investigations against a potential 2020 political rival.

Led by Democrat Jerry Nadler of New York, the committee is also responsible for drafting and approving any articles of impeachment against Trump, which some Democrats have suggested could include charges focused on bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress.
The House Judiciary Committee is much more contentious

Unlike the House Intelligence Committee, a historically buttoned-up panel that has traditionally conducted its oversight of the intelligence community quietly and in a bipartisan fashion, the 41-member Judiciary Committee is one of the oldest and largest in the House, and tends to attract sharp-elbowed lawyers, former prosecutors and passionate advocates because of its sprawling jurisdiction over the justice system, immigration, federal and criminal law.
A mix of party leaders, junior lawmakers, and partisans from both sides of the aisle, the Judiciary Committee also includes some of the most prominent defenders and critics of the president on Capitol Hill.

Members to watch


Trump confidants such as Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led a Republican protest in the closed-door SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and disrupted the Intelligence Committee’s work in October, and Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, who has accused Democrats of waging a “coup” against the president, are both members of the committee, and will take part in questioning of any witnesses moving forward.
For the majority, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a constitutional law professor-turned-Trump critic who has helped craft the party’s messaging on impeachment, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democratic caucus and potential successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are among the Democrats to watch.

The Judiciary Committee also includes veterans of past impeachment efforts, including GOP Reps. Steve Chabot of Ohio and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who were House mangers in the Senate trial in President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who was a committee staffer during Watergate.
Four members of the committee will be familiar faces to viewers of the Intelligence Committee’s hearings: Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Val Demmings of Florida, along with Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas who serve on both panels.

Democrats plan keep the hearing focused on the details of the Ukraine impeachment investigation, and whether they meet the constitutional threshold of bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.
Nadler under pressure to wield a sharp gavel like Schiff and keep Republicans at bay

After Schiff led two weeks of tightly-controlled hearings, many hope Nadler will be able to keep the hearing on track, and prevent the session from resembling the combative hearing with Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, earlier this year, before the Ukraine matter exploded into public view.

Republicans, for their part, have accused Democrats of running an investigation that has denied Trump due process and the ability to question fact witnesses to events at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Using parliamentary inquiries and points of order, they could seek to fluster Democrats and air their concerns about the proceedings.

The White House has rejected Democrats’ offer to participate in Wednesday’s hearing, but has not ruled out taking part in subsequent hearings.
“We're back, by the way, in rerun season here in the Judiciary Committee. We've already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the Mueller report and others,” Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday” this past weekend, referring to the committee’s earlier hearings on the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller.

“This is a complete American waste of time,” Collins said, foreshadowing the kind of attacks he and other republicans can be expected to stage when the hearing gets underway.

Schiff, meanwhile, says his committee will not let up.

“Even while Judiciary does its work, we will continue investigating.” he said on MSNBC Monday night.

He did not tip his hand on the timing of any impeachment vote, but said Democrats believe the matter has some “urgency.”

“This is a threat to the integrity of the upcoming election, and we don’t feel that it should wait.”

He also said he believes the evidence of obstruction of Congress is “overwhelming.”

What are the witnesses expected to say?

The Judiciary Committee will hear from three constitutional experts called by Democrats and one by Republicans.

The GOP’s witness, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, recently wrote in The Hill:

“House Democrats have done a masterful job of holding hearings with testimony from distinguished diplomatic and national security witnesses on the alleged quid pro quo that President Trump sought from Ukraine. The problem is that the record is incomplete and conflicted on critical points. The question is whether Democrats want a real or a recreational impeachment. A real impeachment case can be made, but to make it, they will have to reschedule, reframe, and repeat their House investigation. As compelling and upsetting as much of the testimony has been, the record still lacks direct evidence of a quid pro quo on American military aid to Ukraine,"" Turley wrote.

Testifying for the Democrats, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, recently wrote in The New York Times: “To be sure, Donald Trump had already created a crisis in the presidency by abusing the power of his office to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But that act on its own didn’t count as a constitutional crisis, because the Constitution prescribes an answer to presidential abuse of office: impeachment.

“Now that President Trump has announced — via a letter signed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel — that he will not cooperate in any way with the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives, we no longer have just a crisis of the presidency. We also have a breakdown in the fundamental structure of government under the Constitution. That counts as a constitutional crisis,” Feldman said,

Another Democratic witness, Michael Gerhardt a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, wrote in The Atlantic:

“If you add up the nonsense that the president’s defenders have proliferated and his protestation that the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants, their proposed result is disturbing: an executive who can shut down an impeachment inquiry and protect from disclosure anything done by anyone in the executive branch, and who is immune to criminal investigation and allowed to defy subpoenas.

“This is not the president our Constitution established. He would be a king, in spite of the fact that the Founders’ generation rebelled against one. They set out to create a presidency that was accountable to Congress if the occupant abused power and breached the public’s trust. Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry destroy their vision,” Gerhardt wrote.

The third Democratic witness is Pamela Khan, a professor at Stanford Law School.

Migrant child's death prompts new calls for federal investigation,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/migrant-child-died-border-patrol-custody-vomiting-fever/story?id=67527843,"
House Democrats are demanding an investigation into the death of a migrant teen from the flu while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody after ProPublica released new video Thursday raising questions about the circumstances of the boy’s final moments.

""I was absolutely horrified and sickened by the video,"" Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., told ABC News Live.

""I think it was negligent homicide,"" Bass added.
Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old from Guatemala, was found traveling alone by U.S. Border Patrol agents in May after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas.

A week later, Vasquez came down with a 103-degree fever and tested positive for the flu, according to an autopsy report obtained by ABC News. The report indicates he was prescribed Tamiflu the day before he died.

The video appears to dispute CBP’s account of how the boy was found in his holding cell. CBP reported to the medical examiner that Vasquez was found during a routine welfare check. But the video, obtained from the Weslaco Police Department by ProPublica, shows his cellmate discovering the 16-year-old's body and notifying a nearby official.

""The investigation into the death of Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez is ongoing,"" a CBP spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. ""While we cannot discuss specific information or details of this investigation, we can tell you that the Department of Homeland Security and this agency are looking into all aspects of this case to ensure all procedures were followed.""
In between medical checks Vasquez was seen vomiting while making several trips to the toilet in his cell, according to a review of surveillance video by the medical examiner.

""The inconsistencies between Border Patrol's official account and this video regarding the death of a migrant child is disturbing,"" the House Homeland Security Committee said in a tweet Thursday. ""We need answers from Border Patrol on why their account doesn't match up with this video.""
The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was investigating the case.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement, ""Not only did CBP hold Carlos longer than the legal limit and apparently fail to care for him while he was sick, the agency seems to have been untruthful with Congress and the public about the circumstances around his tragic death. This is inexcusable.""

""The DHS Office of Inspector General should examine all video from Carlos’ time in custody, complete their investigation expeditiously, and release their findings as soon as possible,"" he added.
Vasquez was one of thousands of youths held at Border Patrol stations at the height of the record influx of migrant kids and families crossing the southern border in May. At the time, CBP said the average number of minors held in custody on any given day was around 20,000. In response to the increasing number of unauthorized migrants, CBP ramped up medical personnel staffing and redirected agents from ports of entry to apprehend and process those crossing illegally.

The number of unauthorized crossings has declined since its peak in May, according to CBP data. After more than 11,000 in May, there were just 2,848 unaccompanied minors who crossed the southwest border in October.

""The men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection are saddened by the tragic loss of this young man and our condolences are with his family,"" acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said in May. ""CBP is committed to the health, safety and humane treatment of those in our custody.""

Dem report details 'scheme' by Trump on Ukraine,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-report-details-scheme-trump-pressure-ukraine-benefit/story?id=67467779,"
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Tuesday released a sweeping new report on behalf of Democrats that lays out their case for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, calling it a “wrenching time for the nation” but insisting that nothing less than American democracy is at stake.

At a news conference shortly afterward Schiff said, ""The president ... was willing to sacrifice the national security of the United States ... in order to get what he wanted.""

Asking rhetorically ""What does this means for Americans? Why should they care?"" Schiff said, ""This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security,"" adding, ""Americans should care deeply about whether the president of the United States is betraying their trust in him.""

""We should care about this. We must care about this,"" Schiff said, arguing that if not, Trump would be ""back at it again.""
The report, which can be read here, directly accuses the president of a “scheme” that leveraged his power in office for his own personal and political gain. Democrats allege there is enough evidence from witness testimony and documents to find that Trump conditioned a White House meeting, as well as nearly $400 million in military aid, on Ukraine’s willingness to launch an investigation that included Trump’s 2020 political rival Joe Biden.

The 300-page report also accuses the president of obstructing the impeachment inquiry by telling witnesses to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. Several of those witnesses defied those demands and testified anyway.
“The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation’s upcoming presidential election to his advantage,” Schiff, D-Calif., states in a preface to the report. “In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.”

Schiff said the president and his supporters have attacked “the very idea of fact and truth.”

“America remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world … What we do will determine what they see, and whether America remains a nation committed to the rule of law,” he wrote.

While the report makes no explicit recommendation for possible articles of impeachment, it offers a detailed roadmap that the House Judiciary Committee is expected to use to write them. The report details the president’s actions to leverage Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the help of his close advisers -- specifically naming acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, along with other administration officials.

The report accuses the president of undermining U.S. national security interests and U.S. policy as it relates to Ukraine. It is divided into two sections -- one focused on the substance of the allegations detailing the president’s alleged abuse of power and the second section outlines the obstruction of the impeachment inquiry, focusing on witness intimidation and blocking witness testimony.
The report was released while Trump was attending a NATO summit in London, but the White House was ready with a dismissive response.

""At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump. This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released their own report Monday evening which refutes many of the findings laid out by the Democrats.

That 123-page GOP report argues that Trump should not be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to “benefit in the 2020 election.”
Republicans will have until Thursday to reply to the report voted on Tuesday with their own remarks that will also be passed along to the House Judiciary Committee.
Once the Judiciary Committee has had time to consider the report and conduct their own hearings, the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday, they’ll determine whether or not to propose articles of impeachment.
A joint statement on that point from Schiff and fellow Democrats -- Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney-- read: “It will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offense, whether the President shall be held to account, and whether we as a nation are committed to the rule of law—or, instead, whether a president who uses the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a U.S. election is something that Americans must simply ‘get over.’

“With the release of our report, the American people can review for themselves the evidence detailing President Trump’s betrayal of the public trust.”

A whistleblower report which alleged that Trump had dangled a White House meeting and military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukrainian officials opening an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy launched the House impeachment investigation earlier this year.

It’s been almost nine weeks since members of the House Intelligence Committee began hearing from witnesses as part of the impeachment investigation.
The committee publicly interviewed 12 officials over the two weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving recess. Those hearings followed almost six weeks of closed door depositions with 17 individuals.

During both public and closed door hearings, officials interviewed consistently testified that they believed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy was contingent upon Zelenskiy making an announcement of plans to investigate Biden.

This is a claim that Trump and other White House officials have denied.

Some moderate Democrats are still undecided on impeachment. They explain why.,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/moderate-democrats-undecided-impeachment-explain/story?id=67695821,"
With a House floor vote on impeachment rapidly approaching, many moderate House Democrats said on Thursday they're still reviewing the charges drawn up against President Donald Trump, and will use the weekend to decide how to cast the most consequential vote they've taken in Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling the vote a deeply personal decision for members, said Democrats have no plans to whip members to vote for the articles.

They can only afford to lose 16-17 of the 233 Democrats to be able to pass the charges and formally impeach Trump.
Despite Republicans repeatedly warning Democrats in Trump districts they risk getting beaten in 2020, Democratic aides and leaders say privately they aren't worried about the vote, and expect just a handful of defections.

Still, some Democrats aren't showing their cards.

""I have made my way almost through the entire thing. I will read the rebuttal piece from the minority side. I've gone back and forth and looked at the House rules, I'm looking at the Nixon documents, the Clinton documents just to do what I was trained to do and make an objective decision based on what I think is right,"" Rep. Elisa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA officer and Pentagon official, told ABC News Live Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer.

Rep. Max Rose, a New York Democrat and Army veteran who represents deep-red Staten Island and slices of Brooklyn in Congress, said the vote will come down to ""showing integrity, trying to abide by and uphold my oath to the Constitution.""

""I'm not operating on anyone's timeline but my own,"" he told Dwyer when asked about making up his mind.
Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a U.S. Navy veteran who co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed with a group of House Democratic freshmen with national security experience in September that helped push the caucus towards impeachment over the Ukraine scandal, said she plans to vote for both articles.

""I've always said it was not a political decision it was about what was wrong and what was right,"" Luria, whose Virginia Beach district was carried by Trump in 2016, told reporters.

""If I don't get reelected in 2020 because of it I'll know that I did the right thing and was on the right side of history, and I'll be able to look at myself in the mirror.""
ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce caught up with New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottenheimer.

""Can you explain your current thinking? Why undecided right now?"" she asked.

""Because I made a commitment to my district from the moment that this began that I’m going to focus on all the facts,"" he said. ""I’m gonna read everything, watch all the testimony and the hearings, read the transcripts, consult with scholars, and then of course talk to my constituents, and then make an ultimate decision. But until the final articles are released and they make a…and the committee makes a recommendation, I think it is premature to make a decision. And that’s what I committed to my district that I would do – to read everything, to look at all the evidence, make an evidence-based and evidence-driven decision, and that’s what I plan to do.""
""What have you been hearing from your constituents?"" Bruce asked.

""Frankly, we hear both sides -- those who are for, those who are against this. But I’ve heard from all my constituents, I’ve heard from most of my constituents the same thing – please follow the facts. Make sure you put the Constitution first, don’t let politics play into this. Do what’s best for the country. That I’ve consistently heard. And to make sure that I don’t make a … don’t pre-judge. I think I’ve heard that all along. Don’t pre-judge. And frankly I’ve heard that from Democrats and Republicans – please make a decision based on … a fact-driven decision,"" Gottenheimer said.

Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York, who represents a Trump district, still hasn't made a decision.

""Right now I want to make sure the evidence fits these articles,"" he said.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, one of two Democrats to vote against the resolution launching the impeachment inquiry, said he and Rep. Colin Peterson of Minnesota still plan to oppose both impeachment articles, but only thinks a few Democrats will join them.

""I think it's been pretty static,"" he said. ""I wouldn't expect a huge number ... to vote no.""

Van Drew he's hearing from constituents on both sides of impeachment. The breakdown of calls to his office is about 50/50 on the issue, he said.

""Whatever you do, you are going to aggravate people,"" he said, adding that he had seen ""no"" new evidence or testimony that could persuade him to vote for impeachment.

Sen. Kamala Harris suspends presidential bid,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-kamala-harris-ending-presidential-bid/story?id=66665036,"
Sen. Kamala Harris has suspended her presidential bid, bringing to a close her historic effort to secure the Democratic nomination.

""I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,"" the California lawmaker wrote in a letter to supporters. ""I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do. So, to you my supporters, it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending my campaign today.""

Harris took a hard look at the campaign’s resources over the Thanksgiving holiday and made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with her family and senior aides, a senior Harris aide told ABC News. She will travel to the early states this week to personally and privately thank staff and supporters there for their hard work and dedication to the campaign, the aide added.I’ve got you. As always.❤️ pic.twitter.com/5OJDT3cDfw
Harris' announcement comes after her campaign drastically cut her staff in October, funneling most of her campaign’s resources toward working on a strong victory in Iowa and leaving other early voting states such as New Hampshire and South Carolina with minimal staffing and funding.
“I’m moving to Iowa,” the senator joked at rallies, as she vowed to campaign in the state each week.

Still she plateaued in the polls in the single digits. In a recent ABC News and Washington Post poll, Harris only garnered 2% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents.
Harris entered the race in January speaking before a crowd of 20,000 people, one of the largest in the 2020 cycle. The senator’s presidential hopes were amplified by a sudden boost of support after a breakthrough moment during the first Democratic presidential debate. On the debate stage, Harris, who is black and Indian American, challenged former Vice President Joe Biden on his past stances on busing policies.
""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me,"" Harris said.

On Tuesday, Biden complimented Harris as a competitor.

""She is a first rate intellect, a first rate candidate and a real competitor,"" he told reporters at an event in Iowa. ""I have mixed emotions about it because she is really a solid, solid person and loaded with talent. I’m sure she’s not dropping out on wanting to make the changes she cares about.”

Those changes, Harris underscored on the trail and in her letter to supporters, centered on ""fighting for people whose voices have not been heard or too often ignored.""

On the campaign trail, Harris’ record as district attorney of San Francisco and later attorney general of California, became a frequent area of criticism from her fellow presidential contenders.
As a presidential candidate, Harris' team sought to highlight her efforts as a progressive prosecutor who championed criminal justice reform and held the powerful accountable. In stump speeches across the country, Harris made a pitch to voters about why she was best poised to “prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.”

Harris' popularity rose in part because of her harsh questioning of Trump cabinet nominees such as Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It was those same skills her team tried to highlight as the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump got underway.

President Donald Trump weighed in on Harris' campaign suspension with a short tweeted response: ""Too bad. We will miss you Kamala!""

Earlier in the day, the Trump campaign and some of its staffers mocked Harris on social media over dropping out of the Democratic primary on Tuesday —including congratulating Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a candidate with whom the California senator had differed on the debate stage.

""Somehow we will press on,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News when asked about Harris suspending her campaign.

Harris responded to Trump on Twitter on Tuesday night with a promise: ""Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.""

For her part, Gabbard wished Harris well tweeting ""Sending my best wishes to @KamalaHarris, her family & supporters who have campaigned so hard. While we disagree on some issues, we agree on others & I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people. I look forward to working together on the challenges we face as a nation.""

Others, such as former Democratic presidential nominee and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also lauded Harris for her efforts.

""I’m so thankful for @KamalaHarris’s friendship and candidacy in this race. As a child of immigrants, she’s been a lifelong fighter for opportunity and justice for all Americans, and I’m glad she’ll keep fighting for an America where everyone counts,"" he tweeted.

Former Democratic presidential nominee and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to offer words of encouragement to those who volunteer for candidates who end bids.

""To all the candidates, staff, and volunteers who have worked their hearts out for presidential campaigns that have ended—remember that fighting for what you believe in is always worth it,"" she tweeted.

Minority 2020-ers worry about field's diversity,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/candidates-color-raise-concern-depleting-diversity-democratic-presidential/story?id=67495855,"
Shortly after California Sen. Kamala Harris announced she was ending her presidential bid, the question of depleting diversity in the Democratic field became a rallying point for several of the remaining minority candidates in their own campaigns.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker in an impassioned speech on Thursday blasted the influence of money in politics as one of the reasons she dropped out.

“When an immensely qualified, widely supported truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa. What message is that sending?” Booker said. “I'm just gonna say it plain it is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people.”

The criticism is especially salient given that the current Democratic field is the most diverse in history.

However, several minority presidential candidates have complained that the structure of the Democratic National Committee's polling and fundraising rules to qualify for debates unduly makes it difficult to get the coveted primetime spots on stage needed to gain the national spotlight.

Further, they argue, billionaire-late comers to the race--all of them white men-- have been able to leverage their money to ensure they have ads in critical early state markets and in the social media spaces necessary to net the small donor donations to qualify for the debates.
It is an issue Harris herself cited in a video to supporters announcing she was leaving the race.

“So here’s the deal guys my campaign for president simply does not have the financial resources to continue,” Harris said. “I’m not a billionaire, I can’t fund my own campaign.”

The DNC has said the process has been balanced and fair and highlighted the current diversity in the field.

""This has been the most inclusive debate process with more women and candidates of color participating in more debates than billionaires. We are proud of this historic and diverse field with 20 candidates participating in the first two debates and at least 10 candidates in each debate after that. While we are legally required to have objective criteria for each debate, our qualifying criteria has stayed extremely low throughout this entire process,"" said DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa. ""Nobody who has failed to reach 4% at this point in the race has gone on to be the nominee, and our debate criteria reflects that. In addition, we have made diversity a priority by requiring that every debate have women and people of color as moderators. We’ve never seen a political party take this many steps to be inclusive.""

Harris had qualified for the Democratic presidential debate later this month. With her departure from the race, only six candidates have made the cut to be on the debate stage-- none of them are people of color.

The situation offers an opportunity for self-reflection for the Democratic Party, said a political strategist who wished to remain anonymous.

""I think it's just a moment of reckoning for the party that's like, 'okay, why are we still ending up with an all-white top tier of candidates as the field winnow?' ” he said.

Booker’s presidential campaign said it saw its biggest online fundraising day the day after Harris dropped out, a surge they credit to people’s concerns that the diverse presidential field is narrowing.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, announced his campaign had raised over $360,000 since Harris suspended her candidacy and sounded a similar note of alarm during a call with reporters during said a pre-planned visit to Harris’ home state of California.

“There’s a renewed sense out there that our primaries need better representation. Especially because we’re headed towards the debate, that will have no people of color on the stage,” Castro said.
Asked about the potential of an all-white debate stage in the upcoming Democratic debate, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren also expressed concern.

""I mean, that’s the whole point. We are now looking at potentially a stage of -- there will not be a single person of color on that stage. And as I said, women have been forced out of this race at a time when billionaires can buy their way in. Michael Bloomberg just did a $37 million ad buy in one week in order to make himself a candidate, while he skips the usual parts of democracy like shaking hands with people and hearing directly about their concerns,"" Warren said.

Her departure has also sparked a scramble for Harris’ supporters and staff as Iowans prepare to cast the first ballots on Feb 3.

Castro didn’t answer directly if he was trying to clinch some of Harris’ endorsements, saying, “We're working hard for endorsements from elected officials, community leaders all across the country. Of course, especially in the early states and super Tuesday states.”

Mitch Henry, co-founder and communications director of Iowa’s Asian & Latino Coalition which  endorsed Harris says that Castro’s campaign was the first of at least three other campaigns who reached out within hours of her announcement. He estimates that Castro’s campaign reached out about five minutes after Harris dropped out.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaigns also reached out within four hours of Harris dropping out, Henry said.

Henry has since endorsed Sanders’ campaign, although the coalition hasn’t decided who to back as a group yet.

“Where she stood on many issues is, you know, where Bernie stands. I mean, yes there's a difference in the Medicare for All, they both stood for Medicare for All, like Sen. Warren too but they had different proposals of how to get there,” Henry said.

Vanessa Phelan, chairwoman of the Northwest Des Moines Democrats, an endorser of Harris, said she started getting contacted by surrogates of other campaigns less than 24 hours after the senator ended her campaign.

“Yeah, I think I got the first text that evening,” Phelan said.

“Staffers, I know you are doing your jobs and you are lovely people and I like you bunches but please do not try to organize me today. TOO SOON,” she tweeted a day after Harris dropped out.
But she also considers the some of the renewed interest into Harris’ campaign and the people who support her disingenuous.

“People were happy to peddle misinformation, while she was in the race. Now that she's dropped out, people have nothing but respect for her. So it's, it's upsetting to me to see the attention that she is getting now. I think now people are starting to pick up on the fact that how inspirational she is to children. In particular, girls,” Phelan said.

Harris' campaign woes also stemmed from her own missteps, political experts said.

She was often criticized for not picking out a lane for herself in the Democratic field and either identifying herself as a moderate or more left-leaning candidate. Harris’ supporters backed her for a variety of reasons, making it harder to know who her supporters may endorse next in her absence.

""Part of the problem in terms of trying to figure out where Kamala Harris' supporters go, is that I think she had such a fragmented message that there wasn't a cohesive base behind her,” said, Jessica Levinson, political commentator and professor of law at Loyola Law School. “And so my guess is that they just kind of fan out.  That there are some people who want a woman, there are some people who want a candidate of color, there's some people who want a moderate, there are some people who want a younger take of it.”

Glynda Carr. president and ceo of Higher Heights for America PAC, which seeks to help elect black women in elections across the country, a group which endorsed Harris in November,  said that although they aren’t planning on endorsing another candidate and none have reached out since Harris’ suspended her bid, they’ll continue to help candidates engage with black female voters, a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party.

“Having a cycle starting with one of the most diverse stages, we've ever seen in the Democratic primary has pushed the envelope, not as far as we would like in some of our partnering organizations, but centering conversation of voters that look more like the electorate,” Carr said.

"On flight, Booker talks importance of making December debate: Reporter's Notebook",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/flight-york-booker-talks-importance-making-december-debate/story?id=67448862,"
Aboard what I thought would be a run-of-the-mill flight from Columbia, South Carolina, to New York City's LaGuardia Airport, I heard someone whisper, ""Is that Cory Booker?""

It was.

After storing a briefcase in the overhead bin, the New Jersey senator sat down next to me. I knew he'd come from a campaign event in which he officially filed paperwork to compete in the South Carolina Democratic primary, so I asked him how it went.

He smiled and told me it went well.
During taxi and takeoff, we spoke about a wide range of topics, from the significance of making the December debate stage, his bromance with fellow 2020 contender Andrew Yang and how he decompresses on the campaign trail.

Booker has surpassed the 200,000 donor requirement for the December democratic debate, but is still short in the polls he needs to qualify to take the stage. He told me that missing out on the December debate would be a blow to his campaign because they've seen a fundraising bump after every debate performance, and those funds are critical to keeping his campaign going. He told me he's looking forward to seeing poll results in the next 10 days before the DNC's Dec. 12 deadline.
I asked Booker if he was frustrated by the DNC's debate rules. He told me the rules prevent candidates from spending that money in the field to interact with voters. Instead, he said, candidates are forced to funnel money into digital fundraising appeals. He said the current rules favor wealthy candidates like Tom Steyer who can pump money into ads.

Booker told me that his campaign is working the ground game in early states to collect local endorsements as a means to build momentum.

He's counting on the enthusiasm of his supporters in Iowa. He said that his performance in South Carolina would be dependent on the results of earlier primaries, acknowledging that black voters are pragmatic.
I asked him if his girlfriend, actress Rosario Dawson, would take on a more formal role in his campaign, as she's been spotted by his side on the campaign trail. Booker mentioned that Dawson was a  Sen. Bernie Sanders surrogate in 2016 and he was unsure if she wanted to contribute in that way again.

Booker also shared kind words about his 2020 rival, Yang. He told me the two were friends before the campaign and called him a ""decent"" man and said that his policies come from an ""earnest"" place.

He asked me for Netflix recommendations because during every campaign he's run, he has picked a television show to watch on his downtime. During his Newark mayoral campaign, Booker watched ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""

As our flight took off, Booker, like many other passengers around us, dozed off under an airline-issued blanket. "
Cruz becomes latest senator to promote debunked election meddling narrative,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-floats-debunked-narrative-country-meddled-2016-election/story?id=67603375,"
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas won praise from President Donald Trump on Monday after he became the latest Republican senator to suggest Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, a widely debunked conspiracy theory that the U.S. intelligence community has also notably disputed.

“I do. And I think there's considerable evidence of that,” Cruz said when he was asked on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" Sunday if he believes Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.
“Russia clearly interfered in our election. But here's the game the media is playing. Because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election,” Cruz said.
Cruz pointed to a 2016 op-ed written by a former Ukrainian ambassador blasting President Donald Trump as proof that interference occurred. In the op-ed, the ambassador expressed concern about then-candidate Trump’s comments that he would consider recognizing Putin’s military annexation of Crimea.

His television interview did not go unnoticed by Trump, who thanked Cruz who was sitting nearby during a roundtable discussion on education policy at the White House on Monday.

""By the way you were great on television this weekend. I admired that very .... you did a fantastic job. Everyone's talking about it in a very positive way, too, so, congratulations,"" Trump said to Cruz.
Cruz’s assertions about Ukraine were endorsed last week by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who also insisted “both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.”

Kennedy asserted that news media reports indicated that the former Ukrainian president favored the former secretary of state to win the presidency over then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.

""I think it's been well documented in the Financial Times, in POLITICO, in the Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise,"" Kennedy said last week.

""The fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton,"" the Louisiana Republican added.
Despite Kennedy and Cruz’ claims, there is no evidence that suggests the Ukraine government aided Clinton in 2016.
At the Kremlin's direction, Russian intelligence services waged a pro-Trump disinformation campaign on social media and secretly stole tens of thousands of private emails from the Democratic National Committee, the U.S. intelligence community concluded.

Cruz was asked if he had participated in any intelligence briefings provided to members of Congress on Russia’s efforts to shift blame to Ukraine over election interference.

“I have been in multiple briefings. I have been in multiple briefings, year after year after year, about foreign interference in our election. Russia has tried to interfere in our elections. China's tried to interfere in our elections. North Korea's tried to interfere in our elections. Ukraine has tried to interfere in our elections,” Cruz said. “This is not new. 2016's not the first year they did it. And they're going to keep trying. And so we need to be strong in dealing with it. But the media needs to actually report facts.”

A handful of Republican senators have refuted the unfounded claims in recent days.

""I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from our representatives today from the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests Ukraine interfered in our elections,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week. ""We have ample evidence that Russia interfered in our elections.""

Even the president's top Republican ally in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, said he's seen no evidence suggesting election interference by Ukraine.

""I have no knowledge that the Ukraine did anything to interfere with our elections other than the press reports,"" Graham told reporters, ""and to suggest that we know that, I think, would be a stretch, because I don't think anybody does.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told POLITICO last week that it’s common for countries to prefer one presidential candidate over another.

“I think it’s important to distinguish op-eds… from the systemic effort to undermine our election systems,"" Rubio said. “There’s no way to compare any other efforts to what Russia did in 2016. … There’s nothing that compares not even in the same universe.”

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer weighed in at a Monday news conference.

""The President's defenders have repeated this conspiracy anyway, including shamefully several of my colleagues in the Senate, in an effort to protect the president at all costs, the Grand Old Party in the Senate has become the conspiracy caucus. One conspiracy theory after another, none of them with basis and fact. It's no laughing matter. These conspiracies are not harmless, they are sinister, they are insidious, they damage our democracy,"" Schumer said.

""The fact that Senate Republicans are willing to put wild wind into the sails of these baseless conspiracy theories is beyond alarming, it hurts our country. It hurts our country,"" he said.

Cruz's comments come after several administration officials have warned against Russia’s efforts to pit the blame on Ukraine.

The No. 3 State Department official, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he wasn't aware of Ukraine meddling in 2016.

""Are you aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election?"" the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, asked Hale during a committee hearing last week.

""I am not,"" Hale replied.

The White House's former top Russia expert, Fiona Hill, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last month as part of the House impeachment inquiry, also said the theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is ""a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""

House Democrats line up to serve as Trump impeachment trial managers,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-line-serve-trump-impeachment-trial-managers/story?id=67687135,"
Before they’ve even held an official vote to impeach President Donald Trump, more than a dozen House Democrats are looking ahead to a Senate trial, jockeying for a spot on the high-profile team of lawmakers that will formally present their case.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the final say on who will represent Democrats as impeachment managers, the term used to describe the members who will make the case on the Senate floor. Sources tell ABC News interested candidates have been reaching out to the speaker and encouraged influential surrogates to lobby her on their behalf.

Some have even submitted letters to her office highlighting their credentials, including their relevant legal and professional experience.
Thirteen Republicans were selected to present and argue on behalf of the House during former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998. Democratic aides and lawmakers believe Pelosi is considering a smaller and more diverse group of managers for the upcoming trial.
""It’s important, particularly in this instance where we’re talking about something of consequence to the entire country, everybody in the country, each and every citizen, that they feel that they’re represented in this effort,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told ABC News about the selection process.

Pelosi’s office declined to comment.
While managers have traditionally come from the House Judiciary Committee, members of the House Intelligence Committee -- which led the initial Ukraine investigation that formed the foundation of Democrats’ charges against Trump – could also be considered.

Historically, management teams have included committee chairs and party leaders. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. -- who served as an impeachment manager in the 2010 Senate trial of a federal judge -- are considered top picks for the team, after working closely with Pelosi amid the House's impeachment inquiry proceedings.
They’ve also included lawyers with relevant experience. Schiff is a former federal prosecutor, as is Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., is a former constitutional law professor. Both are seen by colleagues as potential managers.

Pelosi could also tap press-savvy Democrats with experience explaining the case against the president.  Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and David Cicilline, D-R.I., are members of the Judiciary Committee, and attorneys who have worked on party messaging around impeachment as members of Pelosi’s leadership team.

""You do need to tell a story to some degree,"" Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, a former trial lawyer and Clinton impeachment manager, told ABC News.  ""One that is convincing and persuasive.""
To build a geographically diverse team, Pelosi could also elect to pull in Democrats from the South and Midwest, such as Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a former Orlando police chief, or Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., who served as an assistant attorney general in the Illinois attorney general’s office.

The Democrats’ team could also include members from across the political spectrum: Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a member of the Judiciary Committee, is a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, is a leader of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
As speaker, Pelosi has elevated members of the freshman class to leadership positions, and could seek to represent some of the historic 2018 class in the impeachment trial. Many of the freshman Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, including Joe Neguse, D-Colo., and Madeline Dean, D-Penn., have impressed colleagues in the impeachment hearings.
Pelosi could also enlist veteran lawmakers whose experience could serve Democrats well in a Senate trial: Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, is on her third presidential impeachment, after serving as a committee aide during the Watergate scandal against former President Richard Nixon, and on the panel during Clinton’s impeachment.

If Pelosi knows who she’ll select for the job, she’s keeping it tightly held. Democrats and some members of her leadership team are still in the dark.
""When the time is right, you'll know who the people are,"" she told reporters Thursday.

While the House Democratic committee staff and lawyers who helped build the impeachment case are expected to play a major role in preparations for the Senate trial, Pelosi isn't expected to name any staff attorneys -- including Daniel Goldman, the Intelligence Commitee's director of investigations Norm Eisen or Barry Berke, the consulting counsels for the House Judiciary Committee -- to the team as managers.

She could announce the team of managers as early as next week, when the House is expected to take up the impeachment articles on the House floor.

Calif. congressman to resign after the holidays,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-duncan-hunter-resign-shortly-holidays/story?id=67555177,"
Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California will resign shortly after the holidays after pleading guilty earlier this week  to one count of conspiracy in a case surrounding his alleged misuse of $250,000 in campaign donations for personal expenses such as family vacations and oral surgeries.

“Shortly after the Holidays I will resign from Congress,"" he said in an email sent from his congressional office. "" It has been an honor to serve the people of California’s 50th District, and I greatly appreciate the trust they have put in me over these last 11 years.""
He once called the investigation a politically-motivated ""witch hunt.""

On Thursday, the House Ethics Committee sent a letter to Hunter asking him to cease participation in floor votes following his guilty plea, citing a House rule that advises members convicted of crimes for which, ""under federal law, you may receive a sentence of two or more years of imprisonment"" to ""refrain"" from voting.""

The letter cites that though the provision is not mandatory, ""If you violate the clear principles of this provision- that is, by voting in  the House- you risk subjecting yourself to action by this Committee, and by the House, in addition to other disciplinary action that may be initiated in connection with your... conviction,"" the letter reads.

Hunter was the second House Republican to endorse then-candidate Trump during the 2016 election. Trump's first House endorsement came from GOP New York Rep. Chris Collins, who resigned in September before pleading guilty to insider trading related charges.

Together, the two co-chaired Trump's House Leadership Committee in 2016, before Trump won the nomination.

He narrowly won re-election in 2018 after being indicted, along with his wife Margaret, on dozens of charges of improperly using campaign funds.
Hunter also allegedly tapped into some of that money to also finance romantic trysts with multiple congressional aides and lobbyists, according to federal prosecutors in court filings.
Hunter told KUSI in an interview that aired on Monday he decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children. Hunter is due to be sentenced in March. His wife, Margaret, who was also charged in the case and pleaded guilty on a single corruption count, is slated to be sentenced in April.

Hunter's move opens up the possibility of another special election in California, in addition to the one set to take place in the state’s 25th Congressional District, where Democrat Rep. Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid multiple scandals.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on its GOP counterpart to return the $220,000 in contributions Hunter donated to the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Trump impeachment hearings: Here's how the process works,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-process-works/story?id=51202880,"
Impeachment proceedings for Donald Trump are rolling full steam ahead, with Democrats holding public hearings again this week and moving toward drafting articles of impeachment.

While the process has long been discussed for Trump, Democrats’ efforts have gained traction in recent weeks following a whistleblower complaint about a controversial call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was revealed that critics say includes a quid pro quo for political gain.

Since taking control of the House in 2018, Democratic leadership has been wary to broach the subject of impeachment, even after the Mueller report was issued, which did not clear the president of obstruction of justice. But the Ukraine call and its fallout have changed that calculus.

Trump has called the inquiry the continuation of a “witch hunt” that has dogged his presidency and Republicans members of Congress have attacked the process as a sham that disregards the president’s due process rights and impedes his ability to conduct foreign policy.

But what is the impeachment process and what does it mean for Trump and the country?
An impeachment proceeding is the formal process by which a sitting president of the United States may be accused of wrongdoing. It is a political process and not a criminal process.

The articles of impeachment are the list of charges drafted against the president. The vice president and all civil officers of the U.S. can also face impeachment.

The process begins in the House of Representatives, where any member may make a suggestion to launch an impeachment proceeding. It is then up to the speaker of the House, as leader of the majority party, to determine whether or not to proceed with an inquiry into the alleged wrongdoing.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formal opening of an impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, citing what she called Trump’s “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections"" and the full House voted on Oct. 31 to authorize the inquiry. 

In Trump’s case, the House Intelligence Committee was tasked with the investigation and the matter has been turned over to the Judiciary Committee, which could draw up articles of impeachment. But the process is dictated entirely by the ruling party.

A simple majority of the members of the committee would have to vote in favor of approving an article or articles of impeachment in order to proceed to a vote by the full House. The House Judiciary Committee currently consists of 24 Democrats and 17 Republicans; 21 votes in favor would be necessary.

Each article of impeachment that is passed by a simple majority vote in committee would then be voted on by the full House of Representatives. If any of those articles gets a simple majority vote, which is 50% plus one more vote (218), then the president would be impeached.

When it comes to impeachment, the Constitution lists ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,"" as justification for the proceedings, but the vagueness of the third option has caused problems in the past.

""It was a central issue with Andrew Johnson, and there was a question during Clinton's proceedings about whether his lie was a ‘low’ crime or a ‘high’ crime,"" Gerhardt said.
According to Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in constitutional law, ""nobody knows"" what is specifically included or not included in the Constitution’s broad definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

""It’s only happened twice and so the general thought is that it means whatever the House and the Senate think it means,"" Sherry said, and even if the House approves the article or articles of impeachment, the senators can choose to vote against the articles if they feel they are not appropriate.

A president can continue governing even after he or she has been impeached by the House of Representatives. After Clinton was impeached on Dec. 19, 1998,he finished out his second term, which ended in January 2001, during which time he was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. While Clinton continued governing, and the impeachment had no legal or official impact, his legacy is marred by the proceeding.

The Senate is tasked with handling the impeachment trial, which is presided over by the chief justice of the United States. To remove a president from office, two-thirds of the members must vote in favor – at present 67.

If the Senate fails to convict, a president is considered impeached but is not removed, as was the case with both Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. In Johnson’s case, the Senate fell one vote short of removing him from office on all three counts.

While the Senate trial has the power to oust a president from office, and ban him or her from running for future office, it does not have the power to send a president to jail. Disqualification from holding office, a separate process, requires a simple majority vote, according to the Congressional Research Service.

""The worst that can happen is that he is removed from office, that's the sole punishment,"" Sherry said.

That said, a president can face later criminal charges. Sherry points out that in the Constitution ""the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.""

While presidential removal is unprecedented, the vice president would assume office under the 25th Amendment, which was ratified in 1967. Then the new president would nominate a new vice president who would have to be confirmed by a majority of both houses of Congress.

Only Clinton and Johnson have been impeached and no U.S. president has ever been forced out of office.

Johnson faced impeachment in 1868 after clashing with the Republican-led House over the “rights of those who had been freed from slavery,” although firing his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who was backed by the Republicans, led to the impeachment effort. The articles of impeachment centered on the Stanton event, according to the Senate.

Clinton, whose impeachment was connected to the cover-up of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky while in office, was 22 votes away from reaching the necessary number of votes in the Senate.

Richard Nixon faced three articles of impeachment related to the Watergate scandal, in which he allegedly obstructed the investigation and helped cover up the crimes surrounding the break-in.
Nixon faced articles of impeachment, meaning that the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in relation to the Watergate scandal, but didn’t let the process get any further.

But he didn’t let the process get any further, resigning before the House could impeach him.

Pelosi flashes anger when asked if she hates Trump: 'I don't hate anybody',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-flashes-anger-asked-hates-trump-hate/story?id=67519928,"
In a striking moment Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted angrily to a reporter who asked if she hated President Donald Trump, shortly after she announced the House would draw up articles of impeachment against the president.

“I don’t hate anybody,” Pelosi snapped as she pointed and shook a finger at the reporter, James Rosen, a correspondent for Sinclair Broadcast Group who shouted the question as she was leaving her weekly press conference.
Rosen said he was referring to comments from Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and other Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee from Wednesday’s impeachment hearing with constitutional law scholars.
“As a Catholic I resent your using the word hate in the sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president,” she said.A reporter asks Nancy Pelosi if she ""hates the president.""""I don't hate anybody,"" she says in a strong response. ""As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me...Don't mess with me when it comes to words like that."" https://t.co/bsfJRKZ0IN pic.twitter.com/DfSs9d2T33— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 5, 2019

   A reporter asks Nancy Pelosi if she ""hates the president.""""I don't hate anybody,"" she says in a strong response. ""As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me...Don't mess with me when it comes to words like that."" https://t.co/bsfJRKZ0IN pic.twitter.com/DfSs9d2T33
“I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.”
Democrats’ three witnesses in Wednesday’s hearing said Trump abused his office in seeking to pressure Ukraine to launch political investigations. Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University Law School professor and Republicans’ sole witness, argued that Democrats were rushing to impeach Trump prematurely and should continue to investigate and litigate disputes with the executive branch over evidence and testimony in court.

Pelosi said that Trump, in spurning congressional subpoenas and directing current and former aides not to cooperate with House committees, has obstructed their investigations. 
“We’re not going to be accomplices to it,” she said.
The California Democrat, who had previously warned that impeachment could polarize and divide the country, defended the decision Thursday to move forward.

“He’s the one who is dividing the country on this. We’re honoring our oaths of office,” she said.

“I think the president is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence. I think he is cruel when he doesn't deal with helping our dreamers of which we're very proud. I think he is in denial about the climate crisis,” she said.

“However, that is about the election,” she added. “This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president's violation of his oath of office.”

President Trump tweeted about her testy exchange with the reporter.

""Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she “prays for the President.” I don’t believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?"" he said.

On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee will meet to hear evidence presented by The House Intelligence Committee staff that compiled the 300-page Ukraine report. It’s not clear if the White House will participate in the upcoming hearing.

Biden has no plans to appear at Senate trial,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-official-trump-full-senate-trial-live/story?id=67502822,"
Former Vice President Joe Biden is responding unequivocally to a top White House official who said Wednesday that President Donald Trump is demanding a full Senate trial, featuring live witnesses, if and when the House  sends over articles of impeachment: He does not plan to attend voluntarily.

""No, I’m not going to let them take their eye off the ball,"" Biden said outside a campaign event in Iowa Falls, Iowa, on Wednesday afternoon. ""The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes, and I’m not going to let him divert from that. I’m not going to let anyone divert from that.""
Eric Ueland, White House legislative affairs director, delivered Trump's demands to reporters on Capitol Hill earlier in the day.

""We believe very strongly, given the fatally flawed process in the House, that if they were to elect against our better advice to provide articles of impeachment -- send articles to the Senate -- that we need witnesses as part of our trial and full defense of the president on the facts,"" Ueland said.

Ueland gaggled with a handful of reporters just steps away from the Senate chamber for roughly 20 minutes following a closed-door lunch meeting with Senate Republicans on impeachment strategy.
Also in attendance during the luncheon: White House counsel Pat Cipollone, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and former Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh -- the latter two have both been charged with handling the administration's communication strategy on impeachment.

""The underlying impeachment rules of the Senate afford the president a full suite of rights to argue his case on the facts and on the merits,"" Ueland said. ""That's why we believe quite strongly that in order to make the president's whole case in contradiction to a partisan process which doesn't allow him to make his full case, that we need both a full trial and the opportunity to call witnesses and work a trial over here on the Senate floor.""

He suggested the White House wants live witnesses as part of the trial, instead of relying on videotaped depositions like the ones entered into evidence during former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. Ueland did not, however, provide details as to who those witnesses might be.
""The president wants his case made fully in the Senate with a full trial and that’s a point we’re going to make consistently,"" Ueland said.

Republican senators coming out of the meeting offered no additional insights on the process of a potential trial, with many saying they are simply waiting to see what the House ends up doing.

""It was an opportunity for our members to ask questions, for some to offer comments, but you know again it's a fluid process, there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding this,"" South Dakota Sen. John Thune said.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called the discussion ""free-ranging"" and broad in scope.

""There was nothing designed in my view to sway anybody one way or the other To be honest, it was really not very -- I hate to say this because, you know I've been to the White House for the lunch meetings -- it's pretty much the same stuff,"" North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said.

""There was nothing new or a revelation, just a discussion of what might occur,"" Indiana Sen. Mike Braun said in agreement.
Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt gave a small glimpse into what the proposed strategy will be for Senate Republicans.

""Well, the strategy is what the leader talked about the other day: when it gets to the Senate he will decide what the calendar looks like and how much willingness there is to have an agreement, a bipartisan agreement, and if not, how much willingness there is to have 51 votes to either amend or move forward with the current Senate rules,"" Blunt said.

He continued: ""I do think that the president's counsel said enough times -- and he wanted to be sure that we heard it -- that even though they're talking about what they may do if it comes here - they clearly don't believe, based on what's happened so far, that the House should send it here.""
The Republican-controlled Senate also released its 2020 calendar without anything scheduled for the month of January due to the uncertainty surrounding the impeachment trial.

""The only thing I know for sure is that nobody knows what we're doing in January yet,"" Cramer said. ""I think it's just prudent planning.

""January will be a little on the fly,"" Thune said.

Blunt weighed in as well, saying ""often there’s a break around Martin Luther King Day and other things that may very well not happen if we're involved in the impeachment process.""

Cramer added, ""Worst case scenario, let's hope.""
While Senate Republicans met with White House officials to discuss strategy, Senate Democrats said they are preparing for a potential trial, too.

A source close to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the senator gave a presentation during their caucus lunch ""confined to the mechanics of a potential Senate trial because articles have not been drafted.""

""As a part of Schumer’s presentation, members were shown video clips from the 1999 trial to familiarize themselves with the process,"" the aide said.

The aide added that only seven of the current 47 Senate Democrats were in the Senate during Clinton's 1999 trial."
Key takeaways on the House Judiciary Committee's 1st hearing on Trump's impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-house-judiciary-committees-1st-hearing-trumps/story?id=67495621,"
The impeachment inquiry moved to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday with a panel of constitutional scholars tackling the million dollar question in the debate: Do President Donald Trump's actions warrant impeachment under the Constitution?

Three of the witnesses were lawyers handpicked by the Democratic majority: Pamela Khan, a professor at Stanford Law School; Michael Gerhardt a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law; and Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School.

The lone Republican-picked witness was Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.

Here's what you need to know about the hearing:

The Democratic-picked lawyers say Trump is what the framers had in mind with impeachment

Among the three Democratic-picked lawyers, there was no doubt: Trump, they testified, abused his power in office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival. And soliciting a foreign power for personal and political gain was exactly what the framers had in mind when they tucked impeachment powers into the Constitution, they said. If left unchecked, the president could continue to invite foreign powers to help his upcoming election, the lawyers argued.
""We three are unanimous,"" Gehardt said, when they were asked if Trump's actions amount to a ""high crime and misdemeanor,"" as identified in the Constitution.
""If Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution's carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,"" Gerhardt said in his opening statement. ""No one, not even the president, is beyond the reach of our Constitution and our laws.""

The most colorful examples came from Karlan, who described being so riveted by witness testimony in the impeachment hearings that she opted for a mail-order turkey this Thanksgiving so that she could spend her time combing through the details. One ""chilling line"" by Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony, she said, was that Trump didn't need Ukraine to pursue a corruption case against Democrat Joe Biden, but rather just announce one.

""This was not about whether (former) Vice President Biden actually committed corruption or not. This was about injuring somebody who the president thinks of as a particularly hard opponent,"" she said.
Karlan also compared Trump's actions with Ukraine to a president withholding disaster aid for a state.

""Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding,"" Karlan told the panel.

""What would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, I would like you to do us a favor. I'll meet with you, and I'll send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.""

The GOP-picked lawyer had a somewhat surprising argument against impeachment

Turley, who testified during President Bill Clinton's impeachment inquiry 21 years earlier, gave an unusual argument on behalf of Republicans and against impeachment. He didn't defend the president's actions or Trump himself. Turley noted he doesn't support Trump politically and even voted against him in the 2016 election. He did say he's a longtime friend of Trump's attorney general, William Barr.

But Turley also argued that Democrats were setting a dangerous precedent that could one day be used to smear one of their own.
""I get it. You're mad,"" he told the panel in his opening statement. ""The president's mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad.""

Impeachment though won't lessen that anger, he warned. Turley said he didn't think Trump's actions were a ""clear case of bribery"" and that Democrats should wait for the courts to weigh in on their demands for more documents and witness testimony.
Democrats have said they can't wait because Trump's actions present a ""crisis"" that must be addressed.

""That's why this is wrong,"" Turley said of impeachment. ""It's not wrong because Trump is right. … It's wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president.""

He urged Democrats to consider what they will do ""when the wind blows again perhaps for a Democratic president.""

""Where will you stand then?"" he asked.

A conservative congressman attacked the panel as elitists

In perhaps the most explosive exchange of the day, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz attacked the panelists summoned by Democrats as politically motivated elitists and noted their past contributions to progressive campaigns.

According to records by the Federal Election Commission, Karlan has donated money to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's current presidential campaign, and Gerhardt donated money to both of President Barack Obama's election campaigns. Karlan also testified to having supported Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Gaetz, the conservative firebrand and provocateur who at one point crashed closed-door impeachment testimony, accused Karlan of living in ""the ivory towers of your law school."" He also criticized Karlan for making a joke about the president's teen son, Barron Trump.

Earlier in the hearing, Karlan was explaining that the Constitution was written in a way to make the U.S. president behave differently than a king, specifically excluding titles of nobility.

""While the president can name his son 'Barron,' he can't make him a baron,"" she said.

When it was Gaetz's turn to question the witnesses, he jumped on the remark as an attack on a ""minor child.""

""That does not lend credibility to your argument,"" Gaetz said. ""It makes you look mean. It makes you look like you are attacking someone's family.""

Karlan said she did not have contempt for conservatives and added, ""I have a constitutional right to give money to candidates.""

She later asked to apologize for alluding to Barron Trump.

""If I can say one thing, I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president's son. It was wrong of me to do that,"" Karlan said. ""I wish the president would apologize for the things he's said wrong, but I do regret having said that.""
Republicans tried to throw sand in the gears early on

Republicans immediately tried to throw a wrench in the works with demands of procedural inquiries and roll call votes to force testimony from other witnesses.

The theatrics on Wednesday succeeded in slowing down the pace of the hearing and hammered away at a key GOP talking point: The impeachment process is unfair, the Republicans have said repeatedly.
Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the panel, opened the hearing by saying the Democratic quest for impeachment didn't start with Russia or election meddling but rather when liberal voters refused to accept the 2016 election results.

""This is not an impeachment. This is simply a railroad job and today's is a waste of time,"" Collins said.

Roles were reversed during Clinton's impeachment

A poster standing in the hearing room quoted longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler, now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, in 1998 making the same argument Republicans are pressing now -- that impeachment is unfair because it attempts to undo the results of a national election.

Nadler indeed railed against GOP impeachment efforts at the time, when Clinton was impeached for lying under oath to try to hide an extra-marital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

""There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other,"" Nadler said at the time of Clinton's impeachment. ""Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come. And will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.""
On Wednesday, Nadler said one big difference between the two presidents is that Trump has refused to cooperate, noting Clinton's willingness to provide a blood sample to be tested for DNA at one point.

""President Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document, and directed every witness not to testify. Those are the facts before us,"" he said.
Turley, the Republican-picked witness who also testified in 1998, noted that both impeachment proceedings were driven by hyper partisanship.

""The stifling intolerance for opposing views is the same,"" Turley said.

3 female staffers sexually harassed by top Pentagon official: IG report,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagons-top-wmd-official-sexually-harassed-female-staffers/story?id=67690218,"
A top defense official sexually harassed three female staffers before ultimately resigning from his post last April, according to a report from the Pentagon Inspector General's office released on Thursday.

The official, Guy Roberts, was the assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs -- as well as a former Marine Corps infantry officer, judge advocate and staff officer.
In the report, the Pentagon IG said it found that Roberts ""engaged in a pattern of misconduct in which he sexually harassed women on his staff"" to include ""deliberate, unwelcomed physical contact of a sexual nature by hugging, kissing, or touching.""

He also created a ""hostile, intimidating, and offensive work environment for women"" on his staff by making ""deliberate, repeated, and public comments of a sexual nature to members of his staff in meetings and in a town hall forum,"" according to the report.
Roberts told the IG he disagreed with the report's conclusions and that it was not his intent to sexually harass the female employees, but he did acknowledge some jokes he made ""were inappropriate."" After taking into account his response to the report, the IG decided it would not alter its conclusions and said it stands by the findings.

The investigation into Roberts' conduct was opened after one of his female employees issued a complaint back in February. During conversations with some of the 18 witnesses interviewed throughout the investigation, the IG identified two other female employees who were also allegedly sexually harassed by Roberts.
The first employee said Roberts hugged and kissed her when they were alone, even whispering ""I love you"" in her ear and touching her thigh during a social event. That employee also said that Roberts invited her on dates for dinner and drinks, made comments to her about him living alone in an apartment without his wife -- which she perceived as an invitation to be alone together -- and expressed his desire to see her in a bikini.

The employee told the IG that she expressed to Roberts numerous times that she found the behavior inappropriate and told him to ""stop.""
The second and third employees alleged similar unwanted touching -- with the second employee saying Roberts routinely commented on her ""looks.""

Both employees told the IG that they did not report Roberts' behavior because of concerns that it could damage their reputation or negatively impact their careers.

“As a young female growing up in this business, you have to, whether right or wrong … be careful about what you say,"" the third employee said, according to the report.
Asked about the investigation's results during a Pentagon briefing on Thursday, chief spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said he was not aware of the report.

According to his Defense Department biography, Roberts was the principal adviser to senior Pentagon leadership on matters concerning nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, stepping into the role in November 2017.

When he abruptly resigned last April, a Pentagon spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for Roberts’s departure in a comment to Foreign Policy.

“The department’s commitment to modernizing the department’s nuclear force and closely cooperating with allies and partners remains unwavering, and will result in the increased defense of the nation,” said Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a department spokesperson. “We appreciate [Roberts'] service to the department and wish him continued success.”

Because Roberts has already left his post, the IG said they would give the report to the office of the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, for inclusion in Roberts' personnel file.

"Buttigieg to open private fundraisers, release McKinsey client list",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/response-criticism-pete-buttigieg-open-private-fundraisers-press/story?id=67607803,"
With an increased emphasis on transparency on the campaign trail, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been at the center of attacks regarding two main issues: His high-dollar private fundraising and the secrecy behind his work at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company that's shielded by a non-disclosure agreement. Now, his 2020 competitors will have to look elsewhere to go after the presidential hopeful.

After a public call to his former employer to release information about his time at McKinsey, on Monday afternoon, the company decided to allow Buttigieg to reveal the clients he worked for from 2007 to 2010.

“After receiving permission from the relevant clients, we have informed Mayor Buttigieg that he may disclose the identity of the clients he served,” a spokesperson for McKinsey said in a statement, adding that they take its commitments to clients seriously, including protecting their confidence, but “recognize the unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign.”
Buttigieg released a summary of his three years at the firm last Friday. He said that in 2007, he served a nonprofit health insurance provider for three months in Michigan, and in 2008 he worked in the Toronto area analyzing prices for a grocery and retail chain. In 2008 and 2009, he worked mostly in Connecticut on research to fight climate change by improving energy efficiency, and in 2009 he worked in California for an environmental nonprofit. That same year, he also worked in Washington, with trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, for the U.S. government. His final project for McKinsey was from 2009 to 2010, analyzing logistics for a shipping provider.
In its statement, the consulting firm confirmed that the clients Buttigieg described “are all of the clients he served during his time at McKinsey.” Buttigieg’s Senior Communications Advisor Lis Smith tweeted that the campaign would be releasing a list of clients soon.

Following a forum in Waterloo, Iowa, on Friday night, Buttigieg fielded a barrage of questions from reporters who asked if he would break his NDA or how long he would wait for McKinsey to respond to his plea. Earlier that day, the mayor told ABC News’ Whit Johnson, ""I don't think that McKinsey should force me to choose between keeping my word in a legal document that I signed in good faith and the need for the American people to know.""

A few hours before McKinsey’s decision, Buttigieg’s campaign also put an end to a line of attack from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, announcing that future private fundraisers will be open to press beginning on Tuesday, Dec. 10.

“In a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters, and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign,” Campaign Manager Mike Schmuhl said in a statement on Monday. “Fundraising events with Pete will be open to press beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.
While campaigning in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg was repeatedly asked by reporters about the lag in making a decision. He said that his team was working through options to open the high-dollar events.

“Just want to make sure we do it in the, you know, if we approach this that we do in the right.""

For weeks, Buttigieg was fending off attacks from his 2020 Democratic presidential competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as she continued to call him out by name over the weekend, asking him to open up those doors for transparency.

“No closed-door fundraisers where they make promises no one can see. Every candidate needs to reveal what their bundler program is, where rich people get together and squeeze other rich people to be able to pull in money for the candidate, and in return get all sort of special perks from the campaign,” Warren said in Rye, New Hampshire, on Saturday.

Buttigieg used to release the name of his bundlers early on his presidential campaign but eventually stopped disclosing that information.
In response to the attacks from Warren, Buttigieg would strike back with a call for the Massachusetts senator to release tax returns from her years as a corporate lawyer. Something Warren says she will not do.

“I certainly think it would be a good idea for her to release tax returns as I have, covering your entire career and in the private sector. I think that's one way to show your transparency. And I believe in transparency again and being as - as open as I can about my story, and what I've proposed today,” the mayor said in Grinnell, Iowa.

Warren did however disclose documents on Sunday night, showing that she received nearly $2 million from her private legal work over three decades.

Schmuhl says the Buttigieg campaign “strives to be the most transparent in the field,” pointing to examples of their three open press bus tours in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the mayor was on the record with reporters aboard the bus as it traveled to events, and the release of 12 years of his tax returns that cover all of the 37-year-old’s professional life.

“No other candidate for president has released the entirety of their tax returns since their education concluded. No other current candidate for president has released the names of people raising money for their campaign. There are important differences in this race among Democratic candidates, from creating a choice of affordable health care choices for all to removing cost as a barrier to college for those who need it, but transparency shouldn't be one of them,” Schmuhl said.

Trump blasts 'impeachment lite' as House Judiciary Committee considers articles,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-blasts-impeachment-lite-house-judiciary-committee-considers/story?id=67657406,"
As the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday sets the stage for a full House vote on two articles of impeachment, President Donald Trump is mocking the Democrats’ effort to remove him from office as “impeachment-lite.”

“This is the lightest, weakest impeachment -- you know, our country has had, actually, many impeachments,” Trump told a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night. “Everybody said this is impeachment-lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. It's not even like an impeachment.”

Trump pointed out ""bribery"" and ""crimes"" aren't specifically alleged in the articles, trying to minimize the seriousness of the Democrats' effort.

""People are saying they’re not even doing a crime. What happened? All of these horrible things. Remember? Bribery and this and that -- where are they? Trump said. ""They said these two things, they’re not even a crime,"" he said.

He called them ""these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today's announcement. They are now admitting there was no collusion. There was no obstruction of justice. And there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says it. There are no crimes. They are impeaching me and there are no crimes,"" he said.
The two articles of impeachment announced Tuesday charge the president with abuse of power and obstruction of justice. The House Judiciary Committee move represents a historic moment as only the fourth time the House has introduced and considered articles of impeachment against a sitting president.

The Democratic-controlled House is expected to vote to pass the articles before leaving for the holiday recess, which would make Trump the third president in American history to be impeached.

On Tuesday, Democrats argued the that the president ""solicited interference of a foreign government, Ukraine,"" to ""influence the 2020 United States presidential election to his advantage” and then obstructed Congress from its rightful duty to pursue an impeachment inquiry with ""the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance"" of subpoenas and request for testimony.
The president blasted the two charges as nothing more than a political attempt to regain the White House in 2020.

""This has to be a first in history. They are impeaching me. You know why? Because they want to win an election and that’s the only way they can do it,” he said.

While the president and his allies argue Democrats are trying to unseat the president now because they are not confident they can beat him at the ballot box in next November’s election, Democrats maintain that the real threat to the next election would be if they did nothing.

“If we did not hold him accountable, he would continue to undermine our election. Nothing less is at stake than the central point of our democracy – a free and fair election,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at an event with POLITICO following Tuesday’s introduction of the articles of impeachment.

Even as the president rails against the prospect of impeachment, something he says is a “very ugly word,” he insists that it is actually helping him politically.

“Our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment,” the president consistently claims despite persistent poll numbers that demonstrate the president’s historic unpopularity.

The president also pointed to his fresh victory with the USMCA trade deal – a victory House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handed to the president on the same day Democrats introduced impeachment articles – as an upside to the impeachment.

“The silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved USMCA. So that's okay with me,” the president said, claiming that Pelosi made the split-screen announcement because Democrats are “embarrassed” by impeachment.  Pelosi has called it a victory for American workers and ""we ate their lunch"" referring to how Democrats struck the deal with the White House.

“They announced impeachment, then an hour later she announced that she is going to do USMCA. You know why, it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment,” Trump claimed.

While the president offered his own interpretation of Pelosi’s calculation in the near-simultaneous announcements, the dual actions also had the effect of demonstrating an ability to govern and impeach the president at the same time, thus undercutting a White House criticism that impeachment has kept Democrats from pursuing the interests of the American people.

Supreme Court lets abortion ultrasound law stand,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-lets-kentucky-abortion-ultrasound-law-stand/story?id=67598696,"
A contested Kentucky law requiring a physician to display and describe a fetal ultrasound to patients seeking abortions has survived an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Without explanation or notable dissent, the justices declined to take up the case brought by a Kentucky abortion provider, EMW Women's Surgical, that argued the law violated physicians' First Amendment right of free speech.
Supporters of the measure say it's ""prudent public policy"" and important to ensuring patients give an informed consent to end a pregnancy. The law ""does not require anyone to follow a set script; rather, the physician or qualified technician who is making the required disclosures can use his or her own words,"" the state of Kentucky wrote in court briefs.

""Women facing an unexpected pregnancy deserve to have as much medically and technically accurate information as possible when they are making what could be the most important decision of their life,"" said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, an anti-abortion group.

Lower courts have been divided over ""display-and-describe"" ultrasound laws. Two federal courts upheld the Kentucky law, but in a similar case out of North Carolina, a separate federal judge struck down the law.
Monday's ruling allows H.B. 2, Kentucky's forced, narrated ultrasound law, to take effect. The physicians at Kentucky's last abortion clinic will be forced to subject every patient to their ultrasound images, a detailed description of those images, and the sounds of the fetal heart tones prior to an abortion -- even if the patient objects or is covering their eyes and blocking their ears, and even if the physician believes that doing so will cause harm to the patient.

""The Supreme Court has rubber-stamped extreme political interference in the doctor-patient relationship,"" said attorney Alexa Kolbi-Molinas with the ACLU, which helped bring the challenge to Kentucky's law. ""This law is not only unconstitutional, but as leading medical experts and ethicists explained, deeply unethical.""
EMW Women's Surgical Center has said that many women will continue to refuse the ultrasound information.

""As a result of this law, while the patient is half-naked on the exam table with her feet in stirrups, usually with an ultrasound probe inside her vagina, the physician has to keep talking to her, showing her images and describing them, even as she tries to close her eyes and cover her ears to avoid the speech,"" EMW said in court documents.
""A law that requires a physician to keep speaking even though her words do not inform anyone of anything is not an informed consent provision,"" the group argued.

Early next year, the court will hear an abortion rights case from Louisiana involving a law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

The case will be the first test on abortion for the court's new majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents, including President Donald Trump's two nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh."
Senate confirms Stephen Hahn as new FDA commissioner,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-confirms-stephen-hahn-fda-commissioner/story?id=67692986,"
The Senate confirmed Stephen Hahn as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday.

Hahn is poised to take the helm of the agency amid national concern around youth nicotine use with e-cigarettes and lung injuries connected to illicit vaping products. The administration pledged to enact a new policy to take flavored vaping products off the market earlier this year by enforcing current FDA rules but the plan seems to have stalled.
He was confirmed by a vote of 72-18.

President Donald Trump nominated Hahn in November to replace former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who abruptly left the agency in March.
Hahn has spent the majority of his career as a radiation oncologist researching lung cancer and sarcoma. He was named chief medical executive of MD Anderson in 2018.

Prior to that he worked as chair of the radiation oncology department at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

White House budget office offers new legal justification for Ukraine aid hold-up,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-budget-office-offers-legal-justification-ukraine/story?id=67677739,"
As the House moved forward on articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump for holding up military aid to Ukraine allegedly for his personal political benefit, the White House office that placed the hold on the aid released a legal memo saying it held it up the money not for political reasons, but to ensure that it was being spent ""in an efficient and effective manner.""

The Office of Management and Budget's counsel wrote in a letter Wednesday that temporarily blocking hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine for months was justified, and that the office was under no obligation to tell Congress about the pause.
The memo does not explain why Trump first asked about the aid, though, and it does not address whether Trump used the freeze -- as Democrats contend -- to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. That allegation sparked the House's impeachment inquiry.

The letter was sent by OMB counsel Mark Paoletta in response to a request the U.S. Government Accountability Office sent on Nov. 25 asking the OMB to explain its role in holding up the funds. The released of the letter was first reported by the Washington Post.
In the letter, Paoletta said the office held up the funding when it learned, on June 19, that Trump ""had asked about"" the Department of Defense's plans for military funding set aside for Ukraine.

He wrote that the office blocked the funding in order to make sure the funds were being spent ""in an efficient and effective manner, consistent with the purpose for which the funds were appropriated.""

It was OMB's -- and the president's -- duty to do so, he wrote.

The Department of Defense reviewed the planned assistance earlier this year and in May certified that Ukraine had met necessary anti-corruption benchmarks in order to receive the aid.
The memo does not explain what steps, if any, OMB took to determine whether the funds were being spent efficiently and effectively, and it does not explain why the aid was eventually unfrozen.

Paoletta said that OMB wasn't obligated to tell Congress about the hold-up because the pause amounted to a ""programmatic delay,"" which allows the executive branch ""to conduct a process to determine the best policy for the efficient and effective use of funds consistent with the intent of the statute.""
""Pauses in obligational authority are necessary for proper stewardship of taxpayer funds,"" Paoletta said, adding that pauses like this are different from ""deferrals,"" which the president is prohibited from doing without notifying Congress.

""Pausing before spending is a necessary part of program execution: before obligating appropriated funds, it is incumbent upon the Executive branch to understand how an agency intends to execute a program -- and whether that option is the best use of those funds within the program authorization -- before granting it the authority to spend taxpayer resources,"" Paoletta wrote.

""It was OMB's understanding that a brief period was needed, prior to the funds expiring, to engage in a policy process regarding those funds,"" the letter said. ""OMB took appropriate action, in light of a pending policy process, to ensure that funds were not obligated prematurely in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.""

The Note: Democrats flirt with politics of anger in age of Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-democrats-flirt-politics-anger-age-trump/story?id=67523568,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

On Capitol Hill it was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brushing back a reporter who asked if she hated the president: ""Don't mess with me.""

In Iowa it was former Vice President Joe Biden calling out an aggressive questioner asking about unfounded allegations made by the president: ""You're a damn liar.""

Both were reacting to something involving President Donald Trump. Both were also reacting in ways that might have been harder to comprehend if not for Trump.
There's an element in the impeachment push being led by Pelosi that argues that this president has earned a particular type of tone in addition to a specific rebuke. It may also be that Biden's response was understandable, given the personal nature of Trump's allegations.

What Democrats cannot and do not know is whether anger will be rewarded by voters when it counts. Maybe voters want street fighters pushing for impeachment, or vying for the Democratic nomination to go up against Trump.

However that is answered, Trump's dominance of the political conversation extends clearly into subject matter as well as tone. That's been a net positive for him earlier in his still-young political career.

The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks

Democrats are demanding answers to why and how exactly a boy died of the flu while in U.S. government custody last spring.

New heart-breaking and shocking video, obtained by ProPublica, appears to show the child suffering for hours on the floor of a detention center, before he died and was found by his roommate, a fellow minor at the center.

Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass, said the death of 16-year-old, Guatemala native Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez amounted to ""state-sponsored child abuse"" and ""negligent homicide.""
The video seems a direct counter to what the public was first told -- that the boy had been checked on and was found unresponsive by authorities. Now there are urgent questions about whether initial accounts from law enforcement were intentionally misleading and whether evidence from the center could even have been manipulated to try and cover up negligence in the case.

Democrats from the House Homeland Security Committee tweeted Thursday, ""The inconsistencies between Border Patrol's official account and this video regarding the death of a migrant child is disturbing. We need answers from Border Patrol on why their account doesn't match up with this video.""

Vasquez was one of seven minors since early 2018 who were known to die after being in U.S. custody. The big questions now: Will the administration also seek answers? Will anyone be held accountable? And will conditions change?

The TIP with John Verhovek

Biden is hoping for a boost in Iowa from a familiar face who has a comeback story of his own in the Hawkeye State: former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. He overcame lagging early poll numbers to win the 2004 caucuses.

Kerry endorsed Biden on Thursday, calling him ""the candidate with the wisdom and standing to fix what Trump has broken."" On Friday, he will join the former vice president on his ""No Malarkey"" bus tour through Iowa.

The similarities between Biden and Kerry's candidacies, including a much-needed Iowa comeback, were not lost on the former vice president when he was asked about the endorsement and the 2004 campaign.

""I hope it plays out the same way in Iowa,"" Biden told ABC News in New Hampton, Iowa.

Biden seeks to undo Trump immigration policies in first 100 days in new proposal,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-seeks-undo-trumps-immigration-policies-100-days/story?id=67663203,"
Former Vice President Joe Biden released his formal immigration plan Wednesday expanding upon previously announced broad strokes of his plan along with his plan for sending aid to Central America.

Some of Biden’s biggest proposals from his immigration plan include reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program first created during the Obama Administration, working with Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, and reversing the Trump administration’s asylum policies that restrict the number of migrants seeking humanitarian refuge in the U.S.

The former vice president has faced scrutiny over his record on immigration as a member of the Obama administration, and the nearly 3 million people who were deported during their eight years in office. Last month in South Carolina, Biden faced an extended protest during a town hall after he refused to commit to ending all deportations as president, instead pledging to prioritize deportations of those in the U.S. illegally who have committed felony crimes.

On Wednesday, Biden was challenged on this point by Isaac Crop, a worker at Disneyland, who pointed out that there were more people deported under the Obama administration's first three years than the Trump administration. Crop asked Biden what would change if he were president.

""There are more people deported, more people deported during your administration, and we condemn Donald Trump for this same thing. My question for you is if you're elected president, what are you going to do that it's different during your presidency?"" Crop asked.

Biden in his response and his campaign in a briefing with reporters underscored that the former vice president cares about the impact of such policies on families.

""Number one, we understand the incredible pain of a family being separated or sending [them] back---incredible pain,"" Biden told Crop. ""And as I said at the outset, it's all about, in my view, family. And so, for example, there's no reason why a---someone here on a green card should have to choose.""

Senior advisers to Biden spoke with reporters on a call Wednesday morning and laid out Biden’s ambitious to-do list for his first 100 days in office.  Along with reinstating the DACA program, Biden would seek to end Trump’s zero tolerance policy which resulted in family separations along the southern border, decrease restrictions on travel from some of the countries singled out in Trump's travel ban and address stringent caps on refugees entering the country , and expand opportunities for immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have served in the American military, among other goals.

Biden's plan also calls for a review of Temporary Protected Status for people whose home countries have been impacted by war and natural disasters that has been rescinded under the Trump administration, which he spoke about on the trail after his proposal's release.
""We should be engaging and offering our help to organize this hemisphere right now, because you're going to have the destabilization of countries from Belize to Brazil to Colombia because of the millions of people that are fleeing from Venezuela, because that thug who runs Venezuela. And we should be saying what we tried to do in Europe,"" Biden said at an event in Las Vegas Wednesday morning.

""Why in God's name aren't we saying, “OK, we're going to organize the world and the country, the hemisphere to deal with providing for the additional burden it places on those countries and provide for temporary protective status for those Venezuelans who are being persecuted now and are fleeing?” That's what we should be doing. We should not be ending temporary protected status for people to have to go back to places where they cannot---they cannot go,"" Biden continued.
Breaking with some of his 2020 competitors, Biden does not call for restructuring ICE, but rather calls for agency personnel to “abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.”

Biden’s plan also pledges to invest in technology at the border to improve border security, as well as improving cross-agency collaboration for protecting the border. Biden will also “work with Mexico and Canada as partners -- not as adversaries,” if the former vice president wins the 2020 race.

Biden would also budget $4 billion over four years to surge aide to Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador)  to address the root cause of immigration and increase security protections while reducing poverty and corruptions.

Biden’s campaign did not offer a price tag for his immigration plan, saying rather a lot of the changes the former vice president is proposing would be paid for within the existing Department of Homeland Security budget by ending the cost of long-term detention at the border. However, Biden’s team did specify that the $4 billion in aid to Northern triangle countries would be covered in this way.

Aside from his lengthy to-do list for the first 100 days, Biden’s plan also lays out areas he plans to work with Congress on immigration, including creating the pathway to citizenship for those already here,  increasing the number of temporary visas available, and reforming that system.
When pressed on how Biden would get comprehensive immigration legislation passed through Congress, senior advisers cited Biden’s record of working across the aisle and specifically working with Republicans to secure nearly $1 billion in aid. to the Northern Triangle countries while vice president.

Several other 2020 candidates have also released immigration policies, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. All three call for restructuring of ICE, creating a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, and increasing foreign aid to central American countries.
However, unlike other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, Biden does not go as far as to call for making crossing the southern border without documentation a civil violation rather than a criminal violation, which it currently is. Sanders, Castro and Warren have all called for decriminalizing border crossings.

Kamala Harris: Everything you need to know about the 2020 presidential candidate,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-latest-democrat-run-president/story?id=60521324,"
California Sen. Kamala Harris announced Jan. 21 on ""Good Morning America"" that she was running for president in 2020, a move that could make her the first woman and woman of color to serve as U.S. president if elected.

Out of the running:  In an email to her supporters, Harris said she'd taken stock and over the last few days come to ""one of the hardest decisions of my life."" She suspended her campaign on Dec. 3 because, she wrote, that she doesn't have the financial resources to continue.

""I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign,"" she wrote in the email. ""And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.""

Name: Kamala Devi Harris

Party: Democrat

Date of birth: Oct. 20, 1964

Age: 54

Hometown: Oakland, California

Family: Wife to Douglas Emhoff and daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father

Education: She graduated from Howard University in 1981 with a degree in political science and economics. She later earned her J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1989.

What she does now: She was elected as a U.S. senator representing California in 2016, and serves on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on the Budget.

What she used to do: Served as the attorney general of California from 2011 to 2017. Served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Prior to that Harris worked for San Francisco's City Attorney Louise Renne as the chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division and as the deputy district attorney in Alameda County.
Key life/career moments:

Beginning her career as the deputy district attorney in Alameda County, Harris specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases.

She was the first African-American woman to be elected district attorney of San Francisco.

Harris was also the first woman, first African-American and first Asian-American to serve as California's attorney general, and refers to herself as a ""progressive prosecutor.""

While Harris personally opposes the death penalty, she promised to defend it as California's attorney general in 2014, and appealed a federal judge’s decision that it was unconstitutional. Harris also won a $25 billion settlement for California homeowners hit by the foreclosure crisis, but refused to prosecute Steven Mnuchin's OneWest Bank for foreclosure violations in 2013.

While in the U.S. Senate, Harris drew attention for her focused questioning during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Where she stands on some of the issues:

Harris has proposed executive actions to counter gun violence including banning assault weapons and near-universal background checks administered by people who sell over five guns a year. Gun manufacturers and dealers who fail to comply would have their licenses revoked.
She has said that she supports Medicare for all but her recent proposal allows for a role for private health insurers as long as they abide by federal government regulations. She is opposed to tax increases on middle-income Americans and supports a slower transition to her version of the single-payer system which would take 10 years instead of the 4 years proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Harris is also in favor of decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level and has proposed regulating marijuana and expunging prior marijuana convictions. This is in contrast to her previous positions on the issue. From 2011 to 2017, under her purview as attorney general of California, tens of thousands of residents in the state were arrested annually for marijuana infractions, according to a 2016 Drug Policy Alliance report. She said ""times have changed.""
Fundraising:

Harris was one of the biggest fundraisers in the first quarter but finished behind South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the second quarter, raising $11.8 million from 279,000 donors, according to her campaign. She has $13.2 million cash on hand after the second quarter.
What you might not know about her: 

Harris is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, and is the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history.

In Sanskrit, her name means ""lotus.""

She is the author of a memoir, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,"" and the children's book, ""Superheroes Are Everywhere."" Harris credits her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, with empowering her to look for solutions. ""I was raised that, when you see a problem, you don't complain about it, you go and do something about it,"" Harris said in a ""Good Morning America"" interview.

Harris chose to announce her campaign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, citing the civil rights leader as an inspiration. Her campaign colors -- yellow, red and blue -- are a homage to the campaign of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman ever to run for president from a major party."
Mike Bloomberg hits 2020 campaign trail in Mississippi,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-city-mayor-michael-bloomberg-hits-2020-campaign/story?id=67451288,"
Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg brought his late bid for the 2020 White House to the heart of the Deep South on Tuesday, and to one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights movement -- Jackson, Mississippi.

That historic context was not lost at his criminal justice roundtable discussion, where he met with Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and other community leaders at the city's first public school for African Americans.

Bloomberg emphasized his regret for ""stop-and-frisk"" policing, reiterating the apology he made just before launching his campaign.

""We were hyper-focused on saving lives, and one of the things I look back and regret is we were too late in seeing the negative impact that our policies to save lives were having on day-to-day lives,"" Bloomberg said at the roundtable. ""And I do want people to know what's in my heart. I thought long and hard about this: No one should ever feel targeted or judged by the color of their skin.""

""I made a mistake,"" he added. ""I was wrong. I regret it, but I can't undo history.""

Bloomberg has been consistently criticized by criminal justice advocates for the New York Police Department's ""stop-and-frisk"" policy during his time as mayor. He'd long defended his administration's affect on crime rates in New York, but some have cited the negative impact the policy had on police-community relations -- especially among persons of color.

If there were any lingering doubts whether the issue presented a high hurdle for his White House run, today's resounding and repeated mea culpa underscores one thing: His campaign is preparing to vault it.
Tuesday served as the first trail marker as Bloomberg embarks in earnest on his unconventional pursuit of the Democratic Party's nomination, after years of flirting with the idea. His launch site bears the history he'll now seek to address in his own run: He chose to venture forth in Jackson, where during the civil rights movement, many famed Freedom Riders were arrested as soon as they arrived at the city's bus station.

He made brief stops in Virginia and in Phoenix before Thanksgiving, but took to the campaign trail with regularity beginning this week.
The former mayor had earlier apologized for ""stop-and-frisk,"" reversing a longstanding position, while speaking at a black church in Brooklyn.

""I was wrong,"" Bloomberg said. ""And I am sorry.""

It was a stunning reversal for the former mayor, who saw New York through the post-traumatic stress of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

Bloomberg on Tuesday continued to defend his record on crime as mayor, in the same breath as his multiple apologies touting his work in New York as a potential blueprint for what he'd take to the White House.

""I care deeply about fighting discrimination in all of its forms,"" Bloomberg said. ""And the truth is, a big reason why I first ran for mayor was to right historic wrongs on race.""

""As president,"" he added, ""that is exactly what I would do, nationwide.""

Synchronized with Tuesday's roundtable, Bloomberg's campaign team put out a new teaser to a larger criminal justice proposal, with more to roll out in the coming days. It further emphasized the push ahead on the issue at hand, with a plan to address skyrocketing national incarceration rates.

""At least he's accountable,"" Terun Moore, a guest at the roundtable, told ABC News. Moore was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole at age 17, until the Supreme Court ruled that sentencing minors this way was unconstitutional. Now on parole, Moore is a part of the Jackson mayor's task force on parole for capital murder.

""At least he's said he's sorry -- and owns up,"" Moore said. ""And that's part of being a man."""
Trump turns diplomatic after blasting Macron over NATO 'brain death' comments,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-blasts-macron-nasty-nato-comments-ahead-london/story?id=67458948,"
After hurling some harsh words at French President Emanuel Macron earlier Tuesday, President Donald Trump struck a decidedly softer tone while seated beside his French counterpart at an afternoon photo op ahead of the NATO summit in London.

Trump downplayed the bubbling trade dispute between the two countries as “minor” and predicted things will “rosy” again soon.

“We do a lot of trade with France and we have a minor dispute,” President Trump said. “I think we’ll probably be able to work it out. But we have a big trade relationship, and I’m sure that within a short period of time, things will be looking very rosy, we hope, that’s usually the case with the two of us, we work it out.”

The president’s diplomatic tone on the issue comes after the U.S. Monday night threatened $2.4 billion in tariffs on French goods in retaliation of France’s taxes that hit U.S. tech companies.

Trump did not repeat his previous comment calling Macron’s critique of NATO “very,very nasty” and an ""insulting statement"" but President Macron, for his part, said he stands by his critique of NATO as experiencing “brain death.”
Trump earlier repeated his complaints that some NATO nations weren't paying their ""fair share.""

“My statement created some reactions,” Macron said. “I do stand by … When you look at what NATO is and should be, first of all, this is a burden-share, and President Trump just reminded you of some figures, that the U.S. over invested decade after decade, it was number one by far.”

The president then thanked Macron for his comments in recognition of U.S. payments.

“I appreciate you saying the United States for decades had been paying way, way disproportionately too much for NATO and you have other countries paying far too little that are directly benefited by it,” Trump said.

In an exchange that showed there was perhaps more tension under the surface regarding the fight against ISIS, Trump offered to send some of the “tremendous amount of captured fighters” to France, claiming “they're mostly from Europe.”

“Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you,” Trump said.

But the French President wasn’t having it.

“Let’s be serious,” Macron replied, going on to offer a response in which he talked about the need to finish the fight against ISIS.

“And that’s why he’s a great politician, that was one of the best non-answers I’ve ever heard,” Trump then replied.

Earlier, Trump was tougher on Macron when he spoke to reporters during an appearance with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the U.S. ambassador's residence in London, ahead of a summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic alliance.

“You can’t just go around making statements like that about NATO, it’s very disrespectful,” Trump said, despite his having once called NATO “obsolete.”

“Nobody needs [NATO] more than France,” Trump said, “if you just look back over the last long period of time,” in an apparent reference to World War I and World War II.
“I’m not in love with those companies,” he said. “If anybody is going to take advantage of our companies it’s going to be us,” he said.

France has threatened a forceful response if the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to hit the country's cheese, Champagne, handbags and other products with tariffs of up to 100%.

Last month, in an interview with The Economist magazine, Macron had urged NATO to “wake up,” warning that member states were failing to cooperate on key issues and calling into question the future of the alliance.
President Trump has repeatedly chastised NATO allies for not contributing enough financially to the alliance.

All 29 NATO member states have committed to increase their defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2024, but NATO data estimates that only seven members -- including the U.S. -- are estimated to meet the spending target this year.

During the freewheeling appearance with Stoltentberg, Trump also touched on a number of other topics, including the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.

Responding to the suggestion that the probe may overshadow his visit, he said: “Does it cast a cloud? If it does, then the Democrats have done a great disservice to the country.”
The president took a diplomatic approach when questioned about the general election in the summit’s host country, Britain, due to take place Dec. 12. “I stay out of it,” he said, adding that he could “work with anybody,” who came to power after the vote.

Trump has in the past been a vocal support of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, once dubbing him “Britain's Trump,” and has criticized opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would be “so bad” for the country.

"Rudy Giuliani hoping to submit his Ukraine report to Congress, AG Barr this week",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Politics/rudy-giuliani-hoping-submit-ukraine-report-congress-ag/story?id=67609387,"
Rudy Giuliani said he will transmit a ""report"" based on his recent visit to Ukraine to Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in Congress by the end of this week.

""I should probably have it ready on Wednesday or Thursday,"" Giuliani said Monday morning while appearing on ""War Room: Impeachment,"" a radio show hosted by Steve Bannon and Jason Miller. ""I don't exactly know when it'll be made public, but it should be ready by then. I worked on it all weekend.""

Giuliani's report is likely to outline his alleged findings from his trip last week to Kyiv and Budapest, where President Donald Trump's personal attorney, spent several days interviewing current and former Ukrainian officials in an attempt to gather evidence that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. Giuliani, who traveled to Europe as part of a documentary series produced by far-right news network One America News Network (OAN), said his findings will undermine Democrats' impeachment probe back in Washington.
As such, Giuliani said he hoped to present his evidence to congressional Republicans before the House Judiciary Committee votes on articles of impeachment, which could happen before Congress breaks for the holiday.

""It would really bear on fact that the president was not only justified in making this call, the president was required to make this call,"" Giuliani said.
In an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday with ABC News, FBI Director Christopher Wray  undercut the theory that the government of Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,"" said Wray, the most senior, currently serving, government official to undercut the claim.
When asked about the claim, Wray urged Americans to be cautious about their sources of information.

""Well, look, there's all kinds of people saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information, to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear,"" he told ABC News. ""And I think part of us being well protected against malign foreign influence is to build together an American public that's resilient, that has appropriate media literacy and that takes its information with a grain of salt.""

Trump first hinted at the possibility of Giuliani's Ukraine report being sent to Congress on Saturday while speaking to reporters at the White House.

""He's going to make a report, I think to the attorney general and to Congress,"" Trump said. ""He says he has a lot of good information. I have not spoken to him about that information.""
During his radio interview on Monday, Giuliani highlighted a document he obtained alleging misconduct by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

""I know the president is gonna probably get really hot about this,"" Giuliani said, hinting that he may have described to the president some of this information over the phone.
""I haven't been able to describe it to him in person, but it makes everything he did absolutely justified,"" he added, referring to Trump's dismissal Yovanovitch in May.

Giuliani and his associates engaged in an elaborate scheme to undermine Yovanovitch, according to a number of witnesses who testified as part of the impeachment probe in the House. Trump has echoed Giuliani's criticism of the veteran diplomat, telling ""Fox & Friends"" last month, she ""was not an angel, this woman.""
""They're doing it in order to stop me from commenting, stop me from defending him, uh, after all I am his lawyer"" Giuliani stated. ""Horrific, actually.""

Giuliani reiterated he is conducting this work on behalf of his client and not to influence the 2020 election.
""I could care less at this point about the 2020 election,"" Giuliani said. ""My job is to defend my client and that's why I was there now.""

Giuliani's work on matters related to Ukraine and his business dealing with two Soviet-born associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, is the subject of an ongoing investigation by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, sources have previously told ABC News."
Trump tweets at Greta Thunberg to 'chill',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tweets-greta-thunberg-chill-person-year-announcement/story?id=67682690,"
President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday telling Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, to ""chill.""

Trump, 73, wrote ""so ridiculous"" in response to a tweet from actress and producer Roma Downey congratulating Thunberg on being named Time magazine's 2019 person of the year.
""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend!"" the president continued. ""Chill Greta, Chill!""

Seemingly in response to his tweet, Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to read: ""A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.""So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2019 So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE
Later Thursday, a verified Twitter account managed by the Trump 2020 campaign tweeted a doctored cover of Time's 2019 Person of the Year cover -- with Trump's head photoshopped onto Thunberg's body.When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: ✅Booming Economy✅Record Job Creation✅Historic Tax Cuts✅#AmericaFirst Trade Deals✅ISIS Destroyed✅Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY— Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) December 12, 2019 When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: ✅Booming Economy✅Record Job Creation✅Historic Tax Cuts✅#AmericaFirst Trade Deals✅ISIS Destroyed✅Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY
Both tweets come one day after Time magazine's announcement of Thunberg as Person of the Year, which represents the person or group, idea or object, that ""most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse.""

Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said while making the announcement that Thunberg ""represents a broader generational shift in the culture that we're seeing from the campuses of Hong Kong to the protests in Chile to Parkland, Florida, where the students marched against gun violence, where young people are demanding change urgently.""

The president was a finalist for the title this year and has demonstrated a persistent interest in who gets the titled each year. He was selected as Person of the Year in 2016.
This is not the first time the president has gone after Thunberg on Twitter -- and not the first time she's acknowledged it on the platform.

""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Trump tweeted in September after Thunberg gave a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly criticizing world leaders for inaction on climate changeShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.

Thunberg responded then by changing her Twitter bio to read: ""A very young happy girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future."" "
Meghan McCain says Nikki Haley's Confederate flag comments will 'haunt' her,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meghan-mccain-nikki-haleys-opposing-confederate-flag-comments/story?id=67686387,"
Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley sparked controversy this month when she seemingly contradicted her position on the Confederate flag and made comments shining it in a positive light. On ""The View"" Thursday, the co-hosts condemned her position.

Haley, who was also the governor of South Carolina, called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state's capitol building in the wake of the June 17, 2015, massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. On that day, nine people attending a bible study were killed by Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death in 2017, making it the first instance in which the death penalty was given for a federal hate crimes case. The confederate flag was removed from the state capitol on July 10, 2015.
Earlier this month, however, Haley said in an interview with The Blaze's ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" that the Confederate flag was about ""service, and sacrifice and heritage"" until the Charleston Church shooting ""hijacked everything that people thought of"" the flag.

Haley has defended her position on the Confederate flag, and on Wednesday, she wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post asserting that her position on the flag ""has been constant"" and that it is America's culture that has changed.

""The View"" co-hosts Meghan McCain and Sunny Hostin criticized her stance on the Confederate flag.

McCain said that Haley's comments during her interview with The Blaze seemed ""very bizarre"" and her position on the subject was ""strange.""

McCain went on to say that the issue of flying the Confederate flag is a ""very, very deep issue"" for her family because of the backlash her late father Senator John McCain received after he agreed that the flag should be flown above the South Carolina capitol in 1999. She said that his support for that became one of the biggest mistakes of his life and that ""plagued him up until the day he died.""
""He had two big life regrets, this is one of them,"" McCain said of her father. ""It haunted him, this will haunt her. It will, trust me.""

The Arizona senator later renounced his comments on flying the flag.

""I don't understand why we're still debating the Confederate flag,"" McCain added. ""It's a symbol of racism...it's not about what people like me think.""

Hostin chimed in, saying Haley's comments should disqualify her from running for national office.

""She's now tried to diminish the very oppression of my community, of my ancestors, by calling it 'outrage.' Well, I am outraged by that position,"" she said.

""For [Nikki Haley] to somehow say that people think that the Confederate flag is about service, and it's about heritage -- It is about slavery, it is about the oppression of black people"" Hostin continued. ""Nothing more and she knows that. She knows that, and she should never run for national office.""

McCain agreed with Hostin's perspective, saying that Haley ""does know better"" than to make those assertions about the flag. She also said she believes the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is ""clearly"" planning to run for president in 2024.

""It's very evident that she thinks Trump is the wave of the future and in order to do it [she's] going to need his supporters,"" McCain said.

""There's a lot of young conservative women in the country that are not going to get on board with it,"" she continued, ""and defending the Confederate flag is Exhibit A of the best way to get people like me fleeing.""

Hostin doubled down on her stance that Haley shouldn't run for office, saying that Haley also doesn't have the qualities of a leader.

""These are not the actions or the words of a leader,"" Hostin said. ""A leader is someone who stands on morality, stands on conviction, doesn't speak out of both sides of her mouth. She is just, quite simply, not a leader.""

Ivanka Trump and controversial 'dossier' author Chris Steele have a backstory: Source,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dossier-author-chris-steele-met-ivanka-trump-years/story?id=67597270,"
Nearly a decade before the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka met a British intelligence officer who ran the Russia desk -- and when the agent left his covert service and moved into private practice in 2010, she stayed in touch, ABC News has learned.

The two exchanged emails but never worked together, and the man, Christopher Steele, would one day re-emerge in a most unexpected way, taking a central role in the Russia scandal that consumed the early years of her father’s presidency, according to a source familiar with their past contacts.

The prior relationship came to light as investigators with the Department of Justice Inspector General’s office was looking into allegations of political bias at the origins of the Russia investigation since May 2018.
Steele gained notoriety as the investigator who ignited a firestorm by authoring the highly controversial 2016 dossier alleging links between the Trump Campaign and Russia, and embarrassing incidents involving Trump before he took office. Critics of Steele have argued that the former intelligence officer was biased against Trump and was inclined to produce a negative report on the presidential candidate – excoriating Steele on social media and elsewhere.
In 2007, Ivanka Trump met Steele at a dinner and they began corresponding about the possibility of future work together, the source said. The following year, the two exchanged emails about meeting up near Trump Tower, according to several emails seen by ABC News. And the two did meet at Trump Tower according to the source. The inspector general’s report mentions a meeting with a ""Trump family member"" there. They suggest Ivanka Trump and Steele stayed in touch via emails over the next several years. In one 2008 exchange they discussed dining together in New York at a restaurant just blocks from Trump Tower.

Ivanka Trump worked as an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, managing a range of foreign real estate projects, including in parts of the world where Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence touted expertise. She and Steele discussed services Orbis could offer to the Trump Organization regarding its planned expansion into foreign markets, according to two sources familiar with the meetings.
While Steele is a Russia expert, Orbis had a broad portfolio. No formal arrangement followed.

ABC News first learned of the contacts between Ivanka Trump and Steele a year ago, but has only recently been able to view some of their communications.

Members of Trump’s family have never publicly discussed the interactions – and their past meetings with Steele went unmentioned as the Trumps leveled charges against the British intelligence expert in the wake of the controversial and hotly disputed memos he wrote about President Trump.
ABC News sought comment from Ivanka Trump through her attorney, but has not received a reply. Both Steele’s attorney and a representative for Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The inspector general's report, which was released publicly today, briefly references these past dealings. In his discussion with investigators from the inspector general’s office, Steele cited his past cordial relationship with Ivanka Trump as reason to believe that he was not biased against her.

""If anything he was 'favorably disposed' towards the Trump family before he began his research,"" he told the investigators, the report says.

Steele told investigators he met with ""a Trump family member at Trump Tower and ‘been friendly’ with [the family member] for some years,"" even gifting the person ""a family tartan,"" and that the idea he was biased against the family from the start was ""ridiculous,’"" according to the report.  The report does not include the name of the individual.
Trump and his supporters have long held that Steele’s dossier, which the president blasted as phony, was a source of the probe that lasted nearly two years. The probe was already underway when the documents went public.

President Trump and his political supporters have depicted Steele as a villain since word of his role in creating the dossier became public. The president called him ""dopey"" and a ""failed spy"" and on Twitter referred to him as ""Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame"" who was ""tied into Crooked Hillary.""

A retired MI6 officer who founded the London-based intelligence firm Orbis, Steele was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS in 2016 to research then-candidate Trump’s Russia ties.

In June 2019, he was interviewed by DOJ officials who had traveled to London for the review.

Trump administration adjusts work requirements for food stamp eligibility,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-adjusts-work-requirements-food-stamp-eligibility/story?id=67494780,"
The Trump administration announced a final rule on Wednesday that will limit states’ ability to provide food stamps outside of federal work requirements.

The new rule, aimed to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could cause an estimated 688,000 individuals to lose their SNAP benefits, according to the regulatory impact analysis.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Wednesday said the new regulation will restore the “original intent” of SNAP, also known as food stamps. It will work to “move more able-bodied recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) towards self-sufficiency and into employment,” according to  a press release.
States are currently able to get a waiver from existing work requirements based on an area’s unemployment rate and job availability.

Under the new rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will raise the standard for when states are eligible for a waiver from work requirements by adjusting the unemployment rate needed to qualify.

States have been given a limited number of waivers to extend SNAP benefits for individuals who are subject to the time limit, those waivers can be carried over and accrued by states year-to-year. Under the new regulation, USDA will now set “a reasonable limit on the carryover of unused discretionary exemptions,” according to the rule.

The rule faced immediate pushback from groups and members of Congress who argue it would hurt individuals in need.
Michigan Democrat Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, called the administration “out of touch with families who are struggling to make ends meet by working seasonal jobs or part time jobs with unreliable hours,” in response to the announcement.

Stabenow said the rule will hurt individuals who work in the tourism industry and others who have “unreliable hours like waiters and waitresses” in particular.

Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, of New York, called the rule “heartless” and “cruel,” saying it is “driving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches.”

He added, “It exposes a deep and shameful cruelness, and hypocrisy in this administration.”
Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said it “targets very poor people struggling to work.”

“Taking away basic food assistance from these individuals will only increase hardship and hunger, while doing nothing to help them find steady full-time work,” she said in a statement.

Dean called the final rule “much worse than the proposed policy,” saying it “makes it much harder for states with high unemployment to qualify for waivers during a national recession.”

“That change really weakens SNAP’s ability to assist the unemployed during an economic downturn,” Dean’s statement continued.
According to the Agriculture Department, the unemployment rate in 2000 was at 4%, while individuals receiving benefits from SNAP was “just over” 17 million. In 2019, the unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, with more than 36 million individuals receiving SNAP benefits, the USDA said in its statement.

“Americans are generous people who believe it is their responsibility to help their fellow citizens when they encounter a difficult stretch,” Perdue said in the statement.

“Government can be a powerful force for good, but government dependency has never been the American dream. We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand,” he continued. “Now, in the midst of the strongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work.”

The rule would impact “able-bodied adults” without dependents between 18-49 years old. USDA said in the statement it would not apply to “children and their parents, those over 50 years old including the elderly, those with a disability, or pregnant women.”
The USDA added there are “multiple ways for individuals to engage and maintain their SNAP benefits, from working, to preparing for work, and volunteering,” like states providing employment training programs.

“States also have access to programs and services provided by other Federal agencies, state and county governments, and local service providers,” the USDA statement said.

Romney: 'No evidence' Ukraine meddled in 2016,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mitt-romney-evidence-ukraine-meddled-2016-elections-ample/story?id=67473053,"
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah again broke ranks with fellow Republicans and said, based on testimony he's heard from various American officials, he doesn't believe there's evidence to suggest Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections.

""I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from our representatives today from the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests Ukraine interfered in our elections,"" Romney said on Tuesday. ""We have ample evidence that Russia interfered in our elections.""
His comments come after the No. 3 State Department official, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he wasn't aware of Ukraine meddling in 2016.

""Are you aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election?"" the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, asked Hale during a committee hearing Tuesday.

""I am not,"" Hale replied.
Many Republicans, in both the House and the Senate, have continued to peddle the widely debunked theory that Ukraine did interfere in 2016, despite the intelligence community's clear assessment Russia was responsible.

At the Kremlin's direction, Russian intelligence services waged a pro-Trump disinformation campaign on social media and secretly stole tens of thousands of private emails from the Democratic National Committee, the U.S. intelligence community concluded.

The White House's former top Russia expert, Fiona Hill, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last month as part of the House impeachment inquiry, also said the theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is ""a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""
GOP Sen. John Kennedy notably tripled down on Monday, telling reporters he believes Ukraine meddled in the election -- based on what he's read in the paper.
""I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,"" Kennedy said, holding up articles from the Financial Times, the Economist and The Hill. ""I don't think this is fake news. I think these pieces were all well-researched, and it is clear to me that Ukraine did meddle in the U.S. election.""'

Romney, on Tuesday, pushed back against Kennedy's assertions, cautioning Republican colleagues to be wary of conspiracy theories.

""We have to adhere to the facts presented to us by our intelligence community,"" Romney said. ""I know some people will look at newspaper accounts and say, 'Gee, this is what I read in the newspaper,' but you know not every article is exactly accurate, and sometimes your articles are being promoted by an intelligence source that is trying to push a narrative that that is not in our interest.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demurred when asked if he believed Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""The intelligence committees have the ability to look at any of these suggestions,"" McConnell said during a press conference Tuesday.
The Senate Intelligence Committee looked into the allegations and found no evidence of Ukraine meddling.

""The Senate Intelligence Committee spent years looking into this. The conclusions were unanimous that Russia interfered in our 2016 elections,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the committee's top Democrat, said Monday.

""Thank goodness, at least, Mr. Trump's own intelligence and law enforcement appointees recognize this threat, have validated this threat and are actively trying to pursue countermeasures against Russia,"" Warner added. ""I just wish all of us would get on the same page and recognize that threat still exists, and we have to be united.""

Even the president's top Republican ally in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, said Tuesday he's seen no evidence suggesting election interference by Ukraine.

""I have no knowledge that the Ukraine did anything to interfere with our elections other than the press reports,"" Graham told reporters, ""and to suggest that we know that, I think, would be a stretch, because I don't think anybody does."""

STEPHANOPOULOS:  This morning, the latest on the Democratic race, Cory Booker joins us live, plus, Rahm Emanuel and Chris Christie on our powerhouse roundtable.  We will break down the politics, smoke out the spin, the facts that matter this week.

ANNOUNCER:  From ABC News, it's ""This Week."" Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week.""  The witnesses have been heard, the reports written.  Constitutional scholars have weighed in, the party lines harder by the week.  And now that Nancy Pelosi has declared Democrats have no choice, there is no turning back. President Trump on track to become the third American president in history to be impeached, likely by Christmas. Next step, the House Judiciary Committee will draft, debate, and vote on articles of impeachment this week.  They convene first thing Monday morning.  And we're joined now by two members of that committee, Democrat Zoe Lofgren, Democrat Matt Gaetz.  And, Congresswoman Lofgren, let me begin with you. You have played a role in every modern impeachment.  And we're going to show our viewers some of that evidence right there.  You were on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment back in 1973 -- a member of that committee for Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998 -- and the impeachment of President Trump today.  But it appears that at least half the country is unconvinced by your contention that the allegations against President Trump are more serious than the charges against Nixon and Clinton.  Make the concise version of that case.

REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, in the Nixon case, he used presidential powers to influence improperly the election.  He covered it up using the FBI, the CIA.  He abused his power and was voted articles of impeachment as a consequence.

In the case of President Trump, not only has he abused his power to improperly put his thumb on the -- on the scale for the election, he used a foreign power to do it.  And that is -- really hits all of the buttons that the founding fathers were concerned about.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  But, as you know, the Republicans have made the case that the president didn't get what he wanted.  He didn't get the investigation.  The aid went through.

LOFGREN:  Well, the aid was suspended for a while.  As a matter of fact, people died while it was suspended. But he did use that power to get that.  And it's not over.  I mean, he is using agents to get improper things done to try and tar his opponent.  And Rudy Giuliani, his agent, is in Ukraine meeting with KGB-trained people today. This is an ongoing threat to the national security.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  The president said yesterday that he's going to take a report from Rudy Giuliani.  Rudy Giuliani is going to report to the attorney general.

LOFGREN:  Well, I -- that's very interesting. But the fact that Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Sondheim (sic) have acted to try and pervert the national interest to the personal interest is of tremendous concern.  It's an ongoing threat to the national security.  And it's an abuse of power that is -- needs to be dealt with, really. It's -- it's depressing, honestly.  I wish the president's behavior had been better.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't think the Democrats should move to impeach based on the Mueller report.  Does that mean you're against including evidence laid out by Mueller on possible obstruction of justice in these articles of impeachment?

LOFGREN:  My personal view is, we should proceed only on those items where we have direct evidence.
And there is a lot of direct evidence relative to the abuse of power and Ukraine and the Russians, relative to the Biden investigation. The Mueller report is a report.  We don't have a direct witness testimony for most of that, so I think we'd be on firmest ground to move forward where we have direct evidence as with the report we will receive tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. from the intelligence committee.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  And we are going to be covering that, but that gets to the other question 
that has been raised about the speed with which the Democrats are going forward.  You're not going to have the evidence, as you said, from the Mueller report.  Don McGahn hasn't testified yet to the House Judiciary Committee.  You don't have the evidence of Mick Mulvaney, of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Rudy Giuliani, you just called an agent of the president right there.

And The Washington Post had an editorial this weekend.  And here's what they had to say about that.  They said the judiciary committee may well have enough evidence to draw up articles of impeachment but the witnesses and documents that Mr. Trump is improperly blocking might well 
provide a fuller, and to many Americans, more persuasive picture of his guilt.  An American democracy cannot afford for Congress to fail to establish its right to obtain them.  The fight for them must not be 
given up."" Why not wait for those witnesses?

LOFGREN:  Well, the president has improperly withheld those witnesses.  The idea that there's absolute immunity is preposterous.  There is no basis in law or in the constitution for that. I'm mindful that the last time we fully litigated that claim, it took 18 months.  So to allow the president to engage in frivolous appeals so that the appeals extend beyond his term of office really is not what the constitution provides.  The constitution says, the congress shall have the sole authority when it comes to impeachment.

And so the question is, with the evidence we have, can we make a sound conclusion?  I think we can, but when we get our presentation tomorrow from the Intelligence Committee, I think all of us will have a chance to say all of this direct evidence can we reach a conclusion and move forward as our responsibility under the constitution provides, and I think the answer is likely yes.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Back in 1998 you warned Republicans against undoing -- that was your word -- a free election expressing the will of the people.  Here's what you had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

LOFGREN:  You will set the dangerous precedent that the certainty of presidential terms, which is so benefited our wonderful America, will be replaced by the partisan use of impeachment. Future 
presidents will face election, then litigation, then impeachment.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Republicans are echoing that argument today.  They're saying that's exactly what has happened.

LOFGREN:  Well, what I should have said, and I think I did say throughout the Clinton impeachment was, first you need a high crime and misdemeanor.  Lying about sex is not an abuse of presidential power, maybe husband power.  And certainly Trump has done the same thing when it comes to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.  We're not proceeding on his lies about his affairs.  That has nothing to do with the abuse of presidential power any more than it did in the Clinton administration.

Here, we have an instance, as we did with Nixon, of abuse of the power that is vested in the 
president.  And the founders were very concerned that the president that they had created in the constitution had enormous powers.  And if unchecked, if the use of that power was made to subvert the constitutional order, there had to be a remedy and that remedy was impeachment.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Finally, I do want to ago you about this shooting in Pensacola. The Pensacola naval base on Friday by that Saudi national.  FBI still investigating whether or not it was a preplanned terrorist attack, whether or not there were accomplices, but in the wake of this shooting does the United States need to be rethinking our relationship with Saudi Arabia?

LOFGREN:  Well, I have a lot of concerns.  We have, you know -- they murdered a U.S. person who was a reporter for The Washington Post, murdered and dismembered that reporter.  And we've never gotten accounting for that.

So, yes, there are a lot of questions about Saudi Arabia.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Congresswoman Lofgren, thanks for joining us this morning.

LOFGREN:  Thank you.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  And we are joined now by the congressman from Pensacola, Matt Gaetz.  Congressman Gaetz, thank you for joining us this morning.  First, our condolences to your entire community in the wake of this shooting.

Let me ask you the same question I just asked Congresswoman Lofgren, do you think it's time to rethink the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia?

REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  Well, George, thank you for your condolences.  The military is not a feature of my community, it is the defining characteristic of my community.  And I've dealt with killed in action down range, active duty suicide, but there is a special kind of grief when the bravest most patriotic Americans are putting themselves in harm's way to train people from other countries to be able to protect and defend their own country and then they kill us for it.

This isn't the first time my community has experienced that type of grief, and it is deeply,  deeply painful.

Of course, what happened in Pensacola has to inform on our ongoing relationship with Saudi Arabia.  That is the message I directly delivered to the Saudi ambassador when she called to offer her condolences.  There are Saudi’s that are currently with us that are being investigated, and I made the point as clearly as I possibly could that we want no interference from the kingdom as it relates to Saudis that we have, and if there are Saudi’s that we do not have that may have been involved in any way in the planning, inspiration, financing or execution of this, that we expect Saudi Intelligence to work with our government to find the people accountable and hold them responsible. And I was given every assurance from the ambassador that that would occur.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Do you think the president has been tough enough with Saudi Arabia, has delivered the message in the same way you have?

GAETZ:  I am very grateful to the president for being so on top of this.  We've been communicating regularly.  And I can tell you that what you saw from Secretary Esper in terms of ordering a review of this program is a consequence of the president's leadership.

We need to have a review of this program and it's my belief that as Secretary Esper is looking at the recordkeeping, the accounting for these Saudi nationals that are in our country, the continuous observance and monitoring of their activities to ensure that there's not radicalization, while that’s going on, we should pause this program.  We should not be taking new incoming Saudi students until we're absolutely confident in our vetting process.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Congressman, OK, let's move on now to impeachment. And you just heard Congresswoman Lofgren right there discussing Rudy Giuliani's trip to Ukraine this week, a trip that you said was weird.

You're not the only one.  Dan Eberhart, a strong supporter of President Trump, donor to President Trump, said: The fact that Giuliani is back in Ukraine is like a murder suspect returning to the crime scene to live-stream themselves moon dancing.  It's brazen on a galactic level.

Is it wise for Rudy Giuliani to be there?  Or -- and you just heard Congresswoman Lofgren say it could be more examples of an abuse of power by the president.

GAETZ:  I would never compare Mayor Giuliani to a murder suspect.  Let's remember, this is the guy who took down the mob in the '90s and who was out there leading a lot of -- the city of New York during the terrible events of 9/11.  So, I think he gets the benefit of the doubt that he's not akin to a murder suspect.

But it is weird that he's over there and I’m grateful that very soon after, I made those comments on CNN, the president put out a statement that said that Rudy Giuliani does want to come into Congress and explain his role, explain what he's been up to.  And I believe that the president urging Mayor Giuliani to provide that clarity to the Congress will be helpful in resolving what seems to be odd having him over there at this time.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the -- Mayor Giuliani said he's actually representing the president while he's over there and, of course, it's the president who has blocked his top witnesses with direct evidence from coming to the Congress.  You believe that Rudy Giuliani, Mick Mulvaney, Mike Pompeo should all come testify now?

GAETZ:  I believe that Rudy Giuliani has indicated that he wants to. So, I think that's a moot point. As it relates to the other members of the executive branch, the president has to make decisions not only for him but for the presidency.  I think it would inure to the president's advantage to have people testify who could exculpate him, but they -- we want to preserve an executive branch where there are out-of-the-box strategy sessions where people come up with crazy ideas and reject those ideas and hone them.

And if everyone is always worried from now going forward that if you suggest something to the president or you're engaging in conditions conversations about an upcoming challenge, that that’s going to be read out verbatim to the Congress and the country, I think it could -- it could impair the type of creativity and out-of-the-box thinking that we want to see in the executive.  So, I know it's a tough balance for the president.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Democrats are clearly making the case that they’re going to say that the president abused his power by soliciting foreign interference in the election, by soliciting interference so that the investigation of Joe Biden -- even your witness this week, even Professor Turley said that the president's phone call was not appropriate.  It was not perfect.  Can you explain to the American people why you think it's OK for the president of the United States to ask a foreign nation to investigate a political opponent and withhold a White House meeting at the same time?

GAETZ:  I reject the premise of the question and that's what the president was doing.  I think the president was acting on a sincere, longley held view and skepticism of foreign aid.  I think he was acting on concern about Ukraine being the third most corrupt country in the world.

And I think he was also reflecting specific concern about this Biden connection to Burisma.  And remember, it was George Kent, a witness called by the Democrats, who came forward and said, we were so worried about Burisma that our own embassy had to pull out of a public/private partnership that they were engaged in.

But what is so dizzying, George, is the evolving standard for impeachment from Democrats.  Through most of 2019, Nancy Pelosi said she opposed impeachment not because the Mueller facts weren't strong enough in her view, but because it wasn't bipartisan.  She set the standard of bipartisanship for impeachment.

The only thing that's changed now is that we're moving into an election year and she's willing to pursue a partisan impeachment.

And you look back to 1998, Jerry Nadler, our chairman, was saying that it was ripping votes asunder to pursue a partisan impeachment and no impeachment would be legitimate if it was primarily supported by one party and opposed by another. This impeachment is exclusively supported by Democrats in Congress. It's not just that Democrats can't persuade people like me who support the president, they can't even persuade Republicans like Will Hurd, who are critics of the president, to support this impeachment. So they continue to move the goalpost. And my friend Zoe Lofgren, one of the nicest people in Congress, she compared the impeachment in 1998 to fascism, George, fascism.

Now, I don't think that history looks kindly on the '98 impeachment and I certainly don't think it will look kindly on the inevitable impeachment of the -- of the president today.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Gaetz, thanks for your time this morning.

GAETZ: Thank you.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The roundtable's up next.

And, later, Cory Booker joins us live.

We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REPORTER:  Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?

REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I don't hate anybody.

(CROSSTALK)

PELOSI:  I was raised in a Catholic house. We don’t hate anybody -- not anybody in the world.  So don't accuse me --

REPORTER:  I did not accuse you.

PELOSI:  You did.  You did.

REPORTER:  I asked the question.  Representative Collins yesterday suggested that the Democrats are doing because they don’t like the guy.

PELOSI:  I have nothing to do with it.  Let me just say this.

This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president's violation of his oath of office.  I don't hate anyone.  So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Angry House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after she declared the Democrats have no choice but to impeach President Trump to forward on that.

Let’s about it now on our roundtable, our contributors: Chris Christie and Rahm Emanuel; Democracy for America CEO Yvette Simpson; and Republican strategist Alice Stewart.

And, Rahm, let me begin with you.  You know the speaker well.  She would not have come out and made that declaration if she didn't have the votes.

RAHM EMANUEL, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Which one, the one about hate or the one about --

(LAUGHTER)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  The first one about impeachment.

(CROSSTALK)

(LAUGHTER)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  But have Democrats made the case to the country, what needs to happen now?

EMANUEL:  In the beginning of the process, yes.  For the end of the process, that's going to be an evolving piece of that. Look, you have a situation which I actually think knowing the speaker she's weighing, and I think there's a bit of a torture here.  She knows that there's two guardrails.  One is, you don't want to normal normalize impeachment and make it a way to solve political problems.  On the other hand, you have a case where the president of the United States has subverted our national interests for his personal interests.  And you have the kind of the lesson coming out of Bork for the Supreme Court, you have this process that keeps evolving of a mutually assured destruction.  And I think for Nancy, this was an act that if you don't do this, you normalize something for the president of the United States to be acting as if they're above the law.  And that to me is what is happening. On the other hand, she knows the consequence of what this may trigger for other presidents and other congresses down the road, and that is the two guardrails that are guiding her actions at this point.  And I do believe they've made the case that a president of the United States is acting in subverting the national interest for personal interest.  That means he is acting above the law, and therefore, Congress has a constitutional responsibility. And she does take it seriously, very seriously, and is instructive of it, which is why she was reluctant for an entire year and a half.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  She had to move. Meantime, what we’re seeing from the president, he says, go and get it over with quickly, not participating in the House.  Is that a smart move?

CHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, it is.  I mean, he can't gain anything through a process that's already been determined in its conclusion, as you said in our initial question to Rahm.  She would not do this if she didn't have the votes.  I’ve been saying this as you know, for weeks. She's got the votes.  Take the vote.  Get the 218.  Move on to the Senate where they don't have the votes and get to the election.   You know, the fact is every Democrat who speaks about this, you find the clip of them in 1998 decrying this very process and talking about how wrong that was.

And I love to -- her comparison that was not an abuse of power by Bill Clinton.  I find it interesting that someone who is the president of the United States preying upon a 22-year-old intern and using the power of the presidency and the aura of the Oval Office to do it is not an abuse of power.

YVETTE SIMPSON, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Let's look at Lindsey Graham -- who was probably one of the most outspoken people in the Clinton impeachment --

CHRISTIE:  Clips on both sides.

SIMPSON:  Oh, yes, he sounds like a different person.

CHRISTIE:  So, two wrongs make a right in that category.

SIMPSON:  No, look, be consistent, right?  So, if you could find a  reason to impeach a President -- Clinton -- for the things that he did, why can you not find that same thing.

CHRISTIE:  The very same people are saying opposite things.  Zoe is saying in 1998 this is the wrong.  But in 2019, it's right.  That's not consistent --

SIMPSON:  Two different.

EMANUEL:  Apples and oranges.

(CROSSTALK)

ALICE STEWART, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Nancy Pelosi herself said that during the Clinton impeachment that this was motivated by Republicans' hatred of Bill Clinton.  So, we’re seeing the same thing just from different sides of the tribal --

(CROSSTALK)

SIMPSON:  It’s different this time.

STEWART:  And to Rahm's point about normalizing impeachment, what we have is this impeachment process has been driven in large part due to the Democrats' hatred of Donald Trump.  And that --

SIMPSON:  That can't be further from the truth.

(CROSSTALK)

STEWART:  It lowers the standard for impeachment is a very different --

(CROSSTALK)

EMANUEL:  You have -- no, no, (INAUDIBLE) you have a president -- first of all, can you have my time back.  Name me five presidents that asked a foreign government to come in here and basically do op research on a political rival.  Name five, name all five.  It's never happened.

SIMPSON:  There aren't any.

EMANUEL:  This is a totally different situation.

SIMPSON:  Right.

EMANUEL:  You’re inviting a foreign power and it goes to the very words of the three constitutional lawyers and the 500 who signed the letter, who has outlined the fact that you've set up an establishment where a president of the United States inverses two things here. One, he has said that a foreign power can get themselves involved in American election.  He said it in China, he said it about Russia and he said it about Ukraine.   The second thing that I think is really crazy here. He's saying, my personal lawyer could testify, but the secretary of state, who's a confirmed position, the attorney general, who is a confirmed position, the secretary of energy, who is a confirmed position, cannot testify.

That is an inversion of the way the process...

(CROSSTALK)

SIMPSON:  And it's a clear -- clear evidence of obstruction of Congress.

(CROSSTALK)

STEWART:  Three key points on that.

In this phone call, the July 25 phone call, Zelensky and Trump both have said they didn't feel any pressure there.  Zelensky himself did not know that aid was being withheld.  And, third and most important point, the aid was released without condition.

So that is a key component...

(CROSSTALK)

EMANUEL:  The aid was released because the story got broke, not just because the president had a change of heart.

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  What Democrats are saying is, the request is the problem.  Requesting an interference from a foreign nation is the issue.  But...

SIMPSON:  Exactly.  And it's still going on today, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that's the question I wanted to bring to Chris Christie. One of the things I think you're seeing the Democrats develop as these articles are going to be written, they're going to be talking about a pattern.  They're going to be talking about the president inviting Russia back in 2016, inviting China and Ukraine now.  And it's still continuing, we just saw, with Rudy Giuliani.

How can the president allow his personal attorney to be doing this right now?

CHRISTIE:  I think that's what the president wants.  He wants to create even greater sense of chaos, George, and wants to normalize that behavior.  He wants to say, listen, there was nothing wrong with what I did then, and there's nothing wrong with him doing what he's doing. That's what -- that is his strategy.  His strategy is to call this a hoax, to defy exactly what Congress is saying, because he says it's wrong and it's untrue.  That's his -- that's his play. And I think anybody who's watched him for all these years would not expect him to have any other play.  What do you think he's going to do?  Go and sit in the Oval Office and have a contemplative moment and say like, oh, boy, maybe I was wrong?

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE:  By the way, that's not who he is.

EMANUEL:  Here's the thing.

CHRISTIE:  He is a fighter.

EMANUEL:  This is what the Stanford professor said. Can you imagine President Obama, after Sandy, the storm in New Jersey, saying to Chris Christie, who greets him at the airport, I would like to give you this aid for your emergency building, but before I give it to you, I'd like a little help, though?

(CROSSTALK)

EMANUEL:  Ukraine is fighting for their existence against Russia.  And the president is holding that aid until he cracks him to get involved in the American election researching a political rival of the opposite party.

That is what's happening.  And if Chris Christie said -- put him up against the wall at a moment that the state of New Jersey relies on him to secure the billions of dollars to rebuild, that would have been wrong and an impeachable offense. And it would never happen, because nobody would have done that, in the sense of...

(CROSSTALK)

EMANUEL:  ... New Jersey and what the governor needed.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  But, Yvette, how do Democrats deal with the end -- that there can be a lot of reasons for this -- the fact that there are no Republicans, maybe Justin Amash, former Republican, in the House who are going to vote for impeachment?

SIMPSON:  Well, I mean, we knew that, right? What do the Republicans have to lose by stonewalling, right?  They're not going to step out.  The ones who have been vilified.  As soon as Mitt Romney started making his comments, Trump comes after him.  They gain nothing by doing the right thing, right?

They believe they work for the president, which I think Nancy Pelosi has said, rather than working for the American people and to protect the Constitution.

What we have heard, which I'm curious about -- I would love to ask the governor if it's true -- that there might be some Senate Republicans, if they were able to take a private vote, that would actually vote for impeachment.

So the question is, would -- can that process happen...

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, let me take a version of that question to Alice.

Let's say the president -- Chris is right about the president's strategy.  Nothing to see here.  Didn't do anything wrong.  Going to do it again.

Is that something that Republicans in the Senate can stand behind?  Or do they need what has happened in every other scandal, in every other impeachment, whether it's Iran-Contra, Bill Clinton, some kind of apology, some -- some concession from the president?

Don't think that's going to happen?  Do some Republican senators need it?

STEWART:  Senate Republicans are lockstep with this president.  They don't see that he did anything wrong.

Look, a lot of them will agree, like I do, it was inappropriate, but they didn't see a quid pro quo.  They didn't see high crimes and misdemeanor, treason or bribery.  And they're going to stand firm with their position on this.  And it's not going to change.

The question is, what are the 31 Democrats in the House going to do in districts that President Trump won?  How are they going to go and vote for this?  That's going to be difficult.  It's one thing to go out and vote for articles of impeachment inquiry.  Completely different to vote for an impeachment.

And they're going to -- they're going to have -- face some challenges in 2020 if they do.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Tough vote?

EMANUEL:  Well, in the House or the Senate?

STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House, I mean, for these members?

EMANUEL:  No, it's not going to be a tough vote, because the politics have moved, when you have 53 percent of the people saying that it should be an impeachment here.

I will say this.  If you think lockstep is a good message for Susan Collins or Gardner in Colorado, I'm more than willing to...

(CROSSTALK)

SIMPSON:  Absolutely.

EMANUEL:  Not going to be a good vote.  Not going to be.  And that's why they're going to look for room here.

Here's the thing for the Republicans.  In '98, they overshot the runway on impeachment.  Their danger here is, they're going to undershoot the consequences of this runway.

CHRISTIE:  Well, Jeff Van Drew in blue New Jersey has already said he's not voting for impeachment.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  He's the Democrat.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE:  And so the idea that this...

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Maybe Collin Peterson in Minnesota as well.

CHRISTIE:  That's right.

To say this is going to be an easy vote for some of those swing district Democrats has already proven to be wrong, because one of them already, in one of the bluest states in the country, my state...

EMANUEL:  That district is...

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE:  Well, but -- but, Rahm, you know what?  He has an easy vote for some of those swing district Democrats is already proving to be wrong, because one of them already, in one of the bluest states in the country, my state -- well, but Rahm, you know what, he has plenty of support -- wait a second, he has plenty of support from the governor, from all the other members of his congressional delegation, and from the two Democratic United States Senators, Jeff Van Drew can raise enough money to overcome anything.  He's decided he doesn't want to do this.

And in terms of overshooting the runway, Nancy Pelosi knows she's overshooting the runway here, but she has no choice because the majority...

SIMPSON:  Popular opinion is at a higher rate than it was in the Nixon impeachment, period.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Can a president afford to lose one, two, or three Senators on...

CHRISTIE:  I think he can afford to lose two. I think he can afford to lose two.  That gets him to 49.  So you don't have a majority of the United States Senate voting for removal.  And I think that can be a good place where he lands.  And that allows someone like Susan Collins and Cory Gardner to take a walk.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  That assumes Romney holds firm.

CHRISTIE:  Well, you know, listen, I saw Mitt Romney at the vaping meeting in the White House sitting right next to the president at that vaping meeting and agreeing with him and urging him to do certain things.  I don't think anybody thought you'd see Mitt Romney at the White House.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  I want to bring this question to you, because I think Chris just raised an important standard right there.  If on any article of impeachment, a majority of the Senate votes to convict, how serious a problem for the president?

STEWART:  That would be extremely serious. But, you have to look at this from the standpoint of, that doesn't look like it's going to happen.  Certainly, the House is going to move forward.  I don't see the Senate -- if a few Republicans decide to go that route, there will be a few Democrats, I say, that will vote with the Republicans and with the support of the president.

The thing that is important to keep in mind from the public opinion standpoint we're virtually where we were at the beginning.  The needle hasn't moved significantly.  And if something -- if there does need to be consequences for this action, which I do think is inappropriate.  I don't impeachment is the correct consequence.  If there needs to be consequence, let the voters do it in November, let the voters vote him out of office if he did something wrong.

EMANUEL:  Here's the thing, Rudy's act and the president's act works in the House for the moderate Republicans in the Senate, who are going to face races, normalizing the idea that you can go around overseas and have countries and governments and players influence American politics is going to upend and going to be the problem that haunts this president because he's normalized international 
involvement in American politics.

CHRISTIE:  Let's see what Doug Jones does.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Alabama.

CHRISTIE:  In Alabama if he wants to be reelected.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Joe Manchin.

CHRISTIE:  And see what Joe Manchin does in West Virginia.  Joe is further away from an election.  He just had one.  He might have a little more wiggle room in West Virginia, but Doug Jones has no wiggle room.  We'll see what he's going to do.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll have to take a quick break.  When we come back, Democrats in 2020, Kamala Harris is out.  Nate Silver has a look at what that means for the race, plus Cory Booker joins us live.  We're going to have the round table coming back as well.  Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): Over the last few days, I have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. So here's the deal, guys, my campaign for president simply does not have the financial resources to continue. I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it has become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.

In good faith, I cannot tell you my supporters and volunteers that I have a path forward if I don't believe I do.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Kamala Harris now the thirteenth Democrat to drop out of the presidential race. Fifteen remain. Still the largest field in memory. So what is her withdrawal mean for the other candidates? Does Joe Biden benefit the most?

We asked FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver, do you buy that?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NATE SILVER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: So a whole bunch of Democrat had nice things to say about Kamala Harris after she suspended her campaign. And, of course, it's at least in part because they want to pick up some of her support.

According to polling by YouGov, Harris voters have been most likely to consider Elizabeth Warren as their second choice, but a lot of them are considering Joe Biden also.

But let's step back and think about the big, strategic picture. After all, Harris is polling at only 4 percent in the FiveThirtyEight national polling average and 4 percent only gets you so far.

But there are other ways in which she was a bigger factor in the race. Number one for me is that she removes a rival to Biden among African-Americans. The black vote is his fire wall in South Carolina where Biden is still up by more than 20 points in a FiveThirtyEight polling average.

To be fair, Harris herself had only 6 percent of the black vote in South Carolina.  Still with her out of the race, and Cory Booker and Deval Patrick not yet having qualified for the remaining debates, Biden's big lead among black voters looks even more formidable.

Next, Harris also removes a threat to Biden among the party establishment, based on endorsement, the best way we found to track what they're thinking and doing, Harris had been a clear number two after Biden.  With her out, Biden has more than twice as many endorsements as the next remaining rival, Elizabeth Warren, and you had a pretty big endorsement in John Kerry this week.

Finally, Harris and Biden were fishing in a little bit of the same pond as far as fund-raising goes.  Unlike Warren and Bernie Sanders, Biden and Harris have both raised most their money from big donors.  And after a mediocre fund-raising haul this summer, Biden has reportedly seen an uptick this quarter.

So I do buy it.  This is pretty clearly good news for Biden.  All year-long we’re seeing that when Harris tends to rise, Biden tends to fall and vice versa.  With her surprisingly, to me anyway, early exit from the race, Biden is in a position to benefit.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST:  Thanks to Nate for that.

Now let's bring in Senator Cory Booker from Iowa this morning.

Senator, I heard you listen to Nate Silver right there.  You also had some analysis this week of Senator Harris dropping out.  You said the fact that she had to drop out shows that something about the system is not fair.

Unpack that for me a little bit.  She started out with a bang, had 20,000 people at her first rally, raising an awful lot of money early on, performed pretty well in the early debates and only fell back when she stumbled in the campaign.

So, what is it about the system that caused her campaign to fail?

SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, let's compare two candidates.

John Kerry polling like her at 4 percent, John Kerry pulled out all of his other campaign places, pulled it all into Iowa, just like Kamala Harris.  John Kerry had problems in his campaign.  I think he fired staff, just like people reported there were turmoil in Kamala Harris' campaign.

But John Kerry made it to Iowa because he loaned himself $5 million.  Kamala Harris cannot loan herself $5 million.

And so, the Democratic Party which makes a right critique that this -- we should be stopping the influence of big money in politics, that Kamala Harris stopped her campaign because of the campaign finance rules and the fact that she couldn't do what we see billionaires doing in this race, which is flooding ads to jack up their poll numbers and get in.

So, there are a lot of people hurt this week, including members of my family and friends who were supporting me, who just saw this incredibly talented African-American woman who has done things that broken glass ceilings at every point of her career and now somehow the Iowa voters can't make the decision.  I would remind you, John Kerry --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  But -- let me -- let me push back.

BOOKER:  Hold on, let me just remind you.  John Kerry polling at 4 percent goes back, comes into Iowa and finishes number one in the Iowa -- in the Iowa caucuses.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right, but let me push back on that a little.

Joe Biden is not a wealthy man.  Pete Buttigieg is not wealthy.  Bernie Sanders is not that wealthy.  Senator Warren is not that wealthy.  They’re all staying in and doing better.

So, that doesn’t explain it.  And the billionaires in the race, billionaires competing in Iowa -- Tom Steyer, is pretty far back right now.  That's not really determining what's happening in Iowa right now.

BOOKER:  But, George, it’s not just -- it's not just billionaires.  It’s the fact that Iowa voters should have the right to choose, and that's the issue because Iowa belies -- with a lot of respect for Nate Silver -- Iowa belies polls and just about every time.  There was never in the Democratic Party than someone who was a front-runner at this point that's ever gone on to the White House.

Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter -- Barack Obama around this time was about 20 points behind Hillary Clinton.  But Iowa voters where you have to come out here and actually meet folks, you see people who are polling at low numbers end up finishing first.  It wasn't just John Kerry that year, John Edwards was polling at 2 percent and number seven and he finished number two in Iowa.

So, I’m just at the point, at this point in the campaign, let Iowa voters decide.  It goes to the same issue with the debate right now.

You know, we're running a campaign where in Iowa and New Hampshire, we're in the top in endorsements.  We have literally one of the top net favorabilities in the race.  We're called by local media here in Iowa as one of the top field organizations and they've even -- you had press people coming out in Iowa and saying this is ridiculous.  If the pollsters call you, choose Cory Booker because he should be on that debate stage.

So, we’ve been excited.  You know, over the last -- since last debate, we've been experiencing our biggest surge in online donations.  We have tons of people coming out just yesterday, more elected officials endorsing my campaign and are frustrated that we are putting artificial barriers which often could be overcome by people with money determining who Iowa gets to choose from.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  So then what’s your --

BOOKER:  Something is wrong with the system.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  What's your strategy then going forward?  It looks like -- and unless you get four polls in the next four days, looks like you’re not going to make the next debate stage either.  Can you go all in on Iowa?  Just go camp there for the next several weeks?  And does the fact that you have to serve as a likely juror in the Senate trial of President Trump make that strategy almost impossible for you?

BOOKER:  No.

Look, this country is a testimony to the constant achievement of the impossible.  So, we're doing like a lot of candidates have done in the past that were discounted by national media and press.  We're running our campaign, and we're having a great result.

And I have been so grateful to the American people, because folks are going to CoryBooker.com and making contributions to our campaign, helping us to overcome a lot of these artificial barriers.

So, I'm -- this has been one of the best trips to Iowa I have had.  Our crowds are getting so big, we're having overflow rooms.  And so we're going to keep running our campaign. And as far as being a United States senator, I take my oath very seriously, even if the president's going to violate his.  I'm going to be in the Senate and do my job and trust that, here in Iowa, we're going to continue to build on this momentum we're feeling right now.  And I'm really grateful that, at this moment in our campaign, we're breaking records in our campaign, because Americans are saying, your voice is important in this race, and we're going to do everything we can to keep you there, because our online small-dollar contributions are going up. And I hope that Americans will continue to support us in this last sprint to Iowa.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  In that role in the Senate, you will be voting on witnesses.

Do you think Rudy Giuliani, especially in the wake of his trip to Ukraine this week, should appear before the Senate?  And what was your reaction to the president saying that he expects Rudy Giuliani to send a report on that trip to the attorney general?

BOOKER:  Look, this -- this is just a disappointing chapter in American history -- that a president's private lawyer should also be engaging in -- with the president's consent, in foreign policy interference.

At the end of the day, we are one nation, and we have real threats.  And Russia, we know -- I read the intelligence reports -- is a real threat to our country.

And what's going on right now is just unacceptable to anybody who's going to be a fair observer of fact.  And the fact that we can't get to the truth of this matter, because Giuliani is not willing to testify, and the president of the United States is holding back witnesses that could give the American people insights into the true breadth and depth of this corruption, is just -- should be frustrating to everyone.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Finally, let me ask you the question I asked our other members earlier in the wake of this shooting in Pensacola on Friday.

What should be done with the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia?  How should it be reviewed?

BOOKER:  Reviewed -- I mean, this is a relationship we have that's unacceptable, from our military planes refueling their military planes to drop American-made bombs on Yemen, when we have given no authorization for the use of military force, and the tragedies it's causing, with tens of thousands of children dying, to what was mentioned earlier in your show, the murder of -- the outrageous killing of Khashoggi.

This is a relationship that has serious problems.  And the fact that this president seems, in a very transactional way, doubling down on the relationship, and telling us it's because of just financial interests, is unacceptable. America is best when we lead with our values in a resolute manner.  And this is a relationship that needs more than just an examination.  In the Senate, we came together in a bipartisan way to rebuke what -- some of the things we have been doing with the Saudis, like the engagement in Yemen.  It's unacceptable.  And, as president of the United States, I will change it.  We will lead with our values again.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Senator Booker, thanks for joining us this morning.

BOOKER:  Thank you for having me.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  The roundtable weighs in on the Democrats next.

We will be right back.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We all know Trump has been messing around in the Ukraine over there, but you on the other hand sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas or nothing, so you're selling access to the president just like he was.

JOE BIDEN, 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You're a damn liar, man.  That's not true.  And no one has ever said that.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't say you were doing anything wrong.

BIDEN:  You said I set up my son to work in an oil company.  Isn't that what you said?  Get your words straight, Jack.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Anger all over the place in politics this week.  That was Joe Biden in Iowa this week, trying to campaign for those caucuses coming up in just a couple months right now.  Yvette, I saw you shaking your head as you saw that.  But you know you heard a lot of supporters of former Vice President Biden saying, look, it showed he was strong.  It showed he was tough.  How does he have to handle these questions about his son now going forward?

SIMPSON:  Better than that.  I mean I think he's running for president, right.  And what people want to see is a little different I think than what they're seeing on the other side.  I think he needs to go with his prepared statement that the allegations have been investigated, that there was no wrongdoing, keep it moving.  And I think that's the challenge with the vice president is, one, he has these events out in public.  You don't know what he's going to say.  He reacts.  And in a setting like that, you really want to have your best moment, and I don't think that was his best moment.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  And as we're looking at this, Alice, now as we're going forward on the 
Democratic side, I'll have you weigh in on this first.  It looks like it is turning into something of a muddle.  Biden kind of hanging on there nationally atop.  Pete coming to the top, taking more fire now in Iowa.  Elizabeth Warren a little bit stalled and  Bernie Sanders not going anywhere.  What does that tell you as a Republican strategist?

STEWART:  I look at the individual states.  And what we continue to see is the trend of Buttigieg continuing to gain ground in the different states.  And we have really four at the top that you mentioned.  We have Biden and Buttigieg, the more moderate candidates, and then Warren and Sanders, the more progressive and to the left.  That's how I view this continuing to move forward.  The key is who among that group will continue their upward trajectory and be authentic, be consistent with their message, and also connect.  Right now it appears that Buttigieg is doing so, but it just depends on how this moves forward.  Look, Kamala Harris dropping out because she didn't have money, you don't need a lot of money.  You can be a lean, mean political machine going through Iowa.  My camp had no money, but we still won the Iowa caucus because it was about connecting with the voters.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's clearly what Cory Booker is hoping for, Rahm, but at this point can anyone outside that top four, and then you have to set aside Mayor Bloomberg who has got a completely different strategy, break out?

EMANUEL:  Sure.  I would not discount right now Senator Amy Klobuchar.  I think there's a little bit of a movement there in Iowa.  And given -- let me say this, a couple things.  One is I slightly disagree, slightly, it was a plus and minus for Joe Biden.  His basic call on campaign, he's authentic.  Anybody would attack any one of our kids as a father he reacted, and that does go to the strength.  What the weakness was, he had a great ad.  He had a great endorsement and stepped all over it.  And so it's both a plus and a minus on this sense.  I do think what's important here is you lined up the race.  You still have this basically revolutionaries versus reformers and hasn't been decided.  I think what -- if you were honest, the presidential looks like kind of an interlude in the impeachment.  That's kind of the main show and this almost looks -- it's not going to get real until the first of the year.  Well, they're going to learn something really, really important for Democrats and that comes in England.  If Corbin goes down in England with a very unpopular incumbent prime minister, that's going to tell -- and it's as left as you can get.  It's going to tell Democrats something about the general election.  And I think that you look at Thatcher/Reagan, you look at Tony Blair/Bill Clinton, you go through all this part -- Cameron and Bush, it's going to be a very telling piece, it's going to be the first primary primary...

STEPHANOPOULOS:  So, Boris Johnson hurts -- I think I'm hearing Rahm say Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

CHRISTIE:  Listen, I want to go back to Pete Buttigieg, because I don't think there's anything authentic about Pete Buttigieg.  Nothing.

SIMPSON:  I would agree you on that.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Based on?

CHRISTIE:  Listen, he's all over the place.  Now he is the moderate candidate.  In South Bend his record is at best a mixed bag.  And I think what you're seeing now is because Biden hasn't performed, because a lot of people disagree with Warren philosophically, that they have moved to Buttigieg because he's the only one who's had some decent political performing, and he has done that on the stage.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he's been a good campaigner.

CHRISTIE:  Well, listen, but, George, you know, that's not enough as you know when you're running for president.  You also have -- people have to believe you're authentic.  I think one of the problems Cory Booker has had is that people haven't noted him to be as authentic as they hoped he would be.  So, I think Buttigieg has problems.  And I don't think he's going to be --  this is a Biden-Warren race in my view.  And that's where it's going to come down to the revolutionaries versus the reformers.

EMANUEL: And --

CHRISTIE: That's what it's going to come down to. The rest of these people, in my view, are protectors.

EMANUEL: Mayor -- you've got to give Mayor Pete more credit. He had a rough start given incidents in South Bend. And he's weathered them and actually strengthened.  I’m -- to say that he's not authentic, I actually -- I wouldn't go there. He's got -- he has other vulnerabilities. That is not one of them.  And I -- and I -- and I think one of the problems is, he's all head, no heart.

CHRISTIE: What does he -- what does he believe in?

SIMPSON: And I --

CHRISTIE: What does -- what does Buttigieg believe in? There is no theme to the Buttigieg campaign.

EMANUEL: And, look --

CHRISTIE: You know what Elizabeth Warren believes in. You know what Joe Biden believes in.

EMANUEL: OK, I --

CHRISTIE: I have not a clue what Pete Buttigieg believes in, other than Pete Buttigieg and his own ambition.

EMANUEL: No --

CHRISTIE: Those are the two things he believes that works.

SIMPSON: It's a weird day in the world when I'm agreeing with Governor Chris Christie about this.

CHRISTIE: No.

EMANUEL: Kumbaya.

SIMPSON: I have to -- I have to check my temperature, I might have a fever.

CHRISTIE: Let's reach over and have a moment. Come on, let's have that moment.

SIMPSON: I must have a fever. I agree. And what -- what we're hearing -- what we're hearing out on the trail is his shifting from first of all being a progressive on a lot of issues, including Medicare for all, shifting at an opportunistic moment when Biden is falling. This most recent press conference he had where he refuses to disclose who his donors are, keeps putting his foot in his mouth around black and brown voters, he won't get to South Carolina.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I think what we're seeing --

SIMPSON: He won't get to Super Tuesday.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on a second. I think what we're seeing here, though, is something we've seen throughout this -- this -- throughout this primary process so far. Whenever somebody starts to rise, they take a whole bunch of incoming. Now, that comes with -- that comes with the process.

CHRISTIE: I -- I put the phone (ph) on hold --

SIMPSON: But there's -- but there's something different when he literally -- there's something different when you literally shift your policy position so dramatically and people are literally showing --

EMANUEL: That's --

ALICE STEWART, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He's --

SIMPSON: The videos of how he was a huge supporter of these progressive ideals and now he's taking advantage of an opportunity.

STEWART: But you've got --

CHRISTIE: He's been a phony from the beginning.

EMANUEL: He's how people are in their own space (ph) --

STEPHANOPOULOS: Alice, go ahead.

STEWART: Buttigieg is suffering from the whack-a-mole of presidential politics. Now that he's up consistently in several of these early states, people are tearing him down. And that is how the process works.  But the good thing or the thing in his favor for his campaign, this has been a slow and steady increase in the key states and what it exemplifies is the more people meet him face-to-face, the more they tend to gravitate toward him, which goes to show that he is authentic and that is a big factor in determining his nomination (ph).

STEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm, let me -- let me bring you a different question because one of the things we're seeing right now is a kind of a jumbled field.

EMANUEL: Yes.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And I ask people to pay attention going forward to two number, three and 15. You need 15 percent of vote in any -- any congressional district to get a delegate.

EMANUEL: Right.

STEPHANOPOULOS: If three people, candidates, have that coming out of Super Tuesday, the chance that Democrats are going to be able to have a majority on a first ballot is way down there right now. And the fact that Mike Bloomberg is spending all that money on Super Tuesday complicates it even more.

EMANUEL: I never thought I would say this. I -- look, I believe in the spring we're going to have a number of frontrunners without having a nominee.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes.

EMANUEL: And I think that's more -- that's increasingly more likely.  I want to say one other thing. To -- look, Mayor Pete's not about a policy issue so much as about a theme of unity, which is exactly what President Obama ran on. To say that he's -- he's got other issues, but authenticity is not one of them, et cetera.  That said, he is going to come -- he's -- there's four and maybe five seats coming out of Iowa. He's going to have one of them. I think what we should remember about the early process, it's only 150 delegates, but Iowa, all retail politics, New Hampshire, independent voters get to vote, Nevada is going to be machine politics between Harry Reid and the culinary workers and the first time minority voters, Hispanic, get a voice.  Then you go to South -- then you go to South Carolina --

SIMPSON: He does not survive South Carolina.

EMANUEL: OK, but here --

STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, you know what --

EMANUEL: That -- that may be true, but my point is --

STEPHANOPOULOS: You can't make the last point because we're out of time.

EMANUEL: You guys can all go. We're going to sit here and talk.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us.  I'll see you tomorrow on ""GMA,"" followed by our live coverage of the House impeachment hearing starting at 9:00 Eastern.  Have a good day.

Pompeo pushes back on Lavrov claim Trump didn't raise Russia's election interference,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pompeo-pushes-back-lavrov-claim-trump-raise-russias/story?id=67654098,"
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday pushed back on claims by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that President Donald Trump did not warn Russia against interfering in U.S. politics and elections, widening a spat over what was said in Lavrov's second White House meeting with Trump.

The Trump and Pompeo meetings with Lavrov on Tuesday have also come under fire for what critics say is the message they send to Ukraine, one day after the first talks between its new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.

While U.S. support for Ukraine has come into question amid the impeachment proceedings, and Zelenskiy still waiting for a White House visit as a sign of U.S. support, Russia's top diplomat was given a private meeting with the president -- and Trump tweeted a photo of them posing together with broad smiles behind the historic Resolute desk in the Oval Office.Just had a very good meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and representatives of Russia. Discussed many items including Trade, Iran, North Korea, INF Treaty, Nuclear Arms Control, and Election Meddling. Look forward to continuing our dialogue in the near future! pic.twitter.com/tHecH9a9ck— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2019

Trump has consistently called for improving U.S.-Russian relations despite a long list of disagreements between the two countries, from Libya to Syria, Venezuela to North Korea, arms control to diplomatic exchanges. But Russian interference in U.S. politics, including its cyber hack of the Democratic Party and selective leak of emails intended to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, has brought relations between the two nuclear powers to a low point.
The White House said Tuesday that Trump warned Lavrov against Russian interference, hours after Pompeo publicly said during a joint press conference with Lavrov that he had done the same.

""On the question of interference in our domestic affairs, I was clear: It's unacceptable and I made our expectations of Russia clear,"" Pompeo said. ""Should Russia or any foreign actor take steps to undermine our democratic processes, we will take action in response.""
But during his own news conference at the Russian embassy shortly after meeting Trump, Lavrov first said he and Trump never ""even actually discussed elections."" Pressed by reporters, Lavrov -- who has a history of obfuscating -- contradicted himself, saying he raised the issue of elections by again denying any Russian responsibility and asking Trump to publish correspondence between the Kremlin and the Obama White House on the issue from late 2016.

Russian officials have said they denied it at the time and offered to investigate the U.S. allegations of interference, appearing to believe that will exonerate them now, but Trump's White House has so far refused to agree to publishing those.
The White House has not responded to questions about the differing accounts, but when asked Wednesday, Pompeo said that Lavrov's comments were ""not accurately a reflection of my recollection of that meeting.""

""President Trump made clear in the meeting that he had with Foreign Minister Lavrov and the rest of the Russian team that was there that President Trump personally and America finds their meddling in our elections unacceptable,"" he added.
Trump has often downplayed or even outright denied Russia's responsibility for the election interference.

In June, during a meeting with Putin at the G-20 summit, Trump joked that ""of course"" he would tell Putin not to meddle in the 2020 presidential contest. With Putin laughing, Trump mock scolded him: ""Don't meddle in the election,"" he said with a grin.
The White House also said that Trump urged the Russian delegation ""to resolve the conflict with Ukraine"" -- but it's Russian aggression that has fueled that conflict, now in its sixth year and killing over 13,000 people, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, including over 3,300 civilians.

Putin and Zelenskiy had their first meeting on Monday, along with France and Germany -- a peace process called the Normandy format that has been frozen for years. The U.S. is not part of that process, but has supported the implementation of a peace agreement that it reached between Ukraine and Russia, but that has never been fully implemented.
There was no major breakthrough, but progress seemed to be made, with promises of more prisoner exchanges and further talks.

But in a striking symbolic move, it was the Russian foreign minister flying to Washington afterward to brief the Trump administration about those talks, not the Ukrainian. Lavrov was given another Oval Office meeting -- the kind that Zelenskiy has sought as a show of U.S. support since his election in May. While Trump initially agreed to a meeting in Washington, Zelenskiy has still not had a White House meeting, although he and Trump met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September.
""The optics couldn't be any worse,"" Andrew Weiss, vice president of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told The New York Times, adding the Russians had managed to send ""a message to the Ukrainians that they're basically on their own now and need to cut the best deal they can since the U.S. backstop is largely inoperative.""

It seems the administration has not yet been briefed on those meetings by the Ukrainians, although the State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

It's unclear why Lavrov was invited to Washington now. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told CBS News the White House visit was about ""reciprocity"" after Pompeo was received by Putin in May in Sochi, Russia.

Pompeo said Tuesday he was tasked by Trump to try to improve relations and Lavrov's visit was about continuing that: ""We should have a better relationship – the United States and Russia – than we’ve had in the last few years, and we’ve been working on that since that moment."""
Sen. Harris suspends presidential bid,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-kamala-harris-ending-presidential-bid/story?id=66665036,"
Sen. Kamala Harris has suspended her presidential bid, bringing to a close her historic effort to secure the Democratic nomination.

""I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue,"" the California lawmaker wrote in a letter to supporters. ""I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do. So, to you my supporters, it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending my campaign today.""

Harris took a hard look at the campaign’s resources over the Thanksgiving holiday and made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with her family and senior aides, a senior Harris aide told ABC News. She will travel to the early states this week to personally and privately thank staff and supporters there for their hard work and dedication to the campaign, the aide added.I’ve got you. As always.❤️ pic.twitter.com/5OJDT3cDfw
Harris' announcement comes after her campaign drastically cut her staff in October, funneling most of her campaign’s resources toward working on a strong victory in Iowa and leaving other early voting states such as New Hampshire and South Carolina with minimal staffing and funding.
“I’m moving to Iowa,” the senator joked at rallies, as she vowed to campaign in the state each week.

Still she plateaued in the polls in the single digits. In a recent ABC News and Washington Post poll, Harris only garnered 2% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents.
Harris entered the race in January speaking before a crowd of 20,000 people, one of the largest in the 2020 cycle. The senator’s presidential hopes were amplified by a sudden boost of support after a breakthrough moment during the first Democratic presidential debate. On the debate stage, Harris, who is black and Indian American, challenged former Vice President Joe Biden on his past stances on busing policies.
""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me,"" Harris said.

On Tuesday, Biden complimented Harris as a competitor.

""She is a first rate intellect, a first rate candidate and a real competitor,"" he told reporters at an event in Iowa. ""I have mixed emotions about it because she is really a solid, solid person and loaded with talent. I’m sure she’s not dropping out on wanting to make the changes she cares about.”

Those changes, Harris underscored on the trail and in her letter to supporters, centered on ""fighting for people whose voices have not been heard or too often ignored.""

On the campaign trail, Harris’ record as district attorney of San Francisco and later attorney general of California, became a frequent area of criticism from her fellow presidential contenders.
As a presidential candidate, Harris' team sought to highlight her efforts as a progressive prosecutor who championed criminal justice reform and held the powerful accountable. In stump speeches across the country, Harris made a pitch to voters about why she was best poised to “prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.”

Harris' popularity rose in part because of her harsh questioning of Trump cabinet nominees such as Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It was those same skills her team tried to highlight as the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump got underway.

President Donald Trump weighed in on Harris' campaign suspension with a short tweeted response: ""Too bad. We will miss you Kamala!""

Earlier in the day, the Trump campaign and some of its staffers mocked Harris on social media over dropping out of the Democratic primary on Tuesday —including congratulating Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a candidate with whom the California senator had differed on the debate stage.

""Somehow we will press on,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News when asked about Harris suspending her campaign.

Harris responded to Trump on Twitter on Tuesday night with a promise: ""Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial.""

For her part, Gabbard wished Harris well tweeting ""Sending my best wishes to @KamalaHarris, her family & supporters who have campaigned so hard. While we disagree on some issues, we agree on others & I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people. I look forward to working together on the challenges we face as a nation.""

Others, such as former Democratic presidential nominee and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also lauded Harris for her efforts.

""I’m so thankful for @KamalaHarris’s friendship and candidacy in this race. As a child of immigrants, she’s been a lifelong fighter for opportunity and justice for all Americans, and I’m glad she’ll keep fighting for an America where everyone counts,"" he tweeted.

Former Democratic presidential nominee and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to offer words of encouragement to those who volunteer for candidates who end bids.

""To all the candidates, staff, and volunteers who have worked their hearts out for presidential campaigns that have ended—remember that fighting for what you believe in is always worth it,"" she tweeted.

Sanders reunites with veteran who debated suicide,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veteran-contemplated-suicide-reunites-bernie-sanders/story?id=67610294,"
Sen. Bernie Sanders reunited Monday with a veteran who garnered headlines after telling the presidential candidate he was contemplating suicide due to being saddled with $139,000 in medical debt.

The Naval Air Force veteran, named John Weigel, told the Vermont senator and a crowd of attendees at a campaign-sponsored town hall in September that he didn’t know how he would pay for compounding medical debt for the treatment of Huntington’s disease.

""I can’t. I can’t. I’m gonna kill myself,"" Weigel told Sanders in their first encounter.

""Hold on, John, stop it, you’re not gonna kill yourself,"" Sanders replied.
Nearly three months later, Weigel attended another Sanders event to report that his medical debt was now under control. He said that he was now only paying $29.50 per month.

""Because of your support, Sens. [Catherine] Cortez-Masto and Jacky Rosen got involved and straightened out my bills,"" Weigel told Sanders and the crowd in Gardnerville, Nevada.
He later added, ""Thank you for rescuing me.""

Weigel attempted to give Sanders his flight jacket, but Sanders declined to take it. Instead, Weigel ripped his flight patch off the jacket and gave it to Sanders.
""As a nation, we can disagree about a war. We can disagree about foreign policy, but when brave people like John put their lives on the line to defend our country, when they come home, they will receive the best quality health care that this country can provide them,"" said Sanders. ""And they will not have to go deeply in debt or be harassed by bill collectors for some stupid bureaucratic reason.""

Sanders, who has made health care reform his central platform, previously released a plan that, if enacted, would cancel $81 billion in medical debt for millions of Americans, reform bankruptcy rules to allow for medical debt relief and prevent medical debt from impacting credit scores.

Pelosi on Trump impeachment articles: 'They're very strong',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-trump-impeachment-articles-theyre-strong/story?id=67685149,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump ""very strong"" even as he and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee argued that they allege no specific crime, such as bribery, was committed.

""The articles are what they are. They’re very powerful. They’re very strong,"" Pelosi said as the Judiciary Committee was debating the wording of the articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

The debate came ahead of an expected final vote Thursday to send them to the House for final votes next week.

Asked why no specific crime such as bribery was included -- a charge Pelosi herself has leveled against the president -- she answered, ""I, myself, am not a lawyer, although sometimes I act like one,"" saying that she had left the matter up to the committee chairs and legal counsel.

""The president is wrong,"" Pelosi said flatly, responding to his calling this ""impeachment lite.""
""Nothing swift about it, but it is urgent,"" Pelosi said, about the speed of the Democrats' impeachment effort, saying six committees have been working on the impeachment investigation ""for a long time.""

Democrats argue Trump poses a ""clear and present danger"" to American democracy because, unless he's stopped, they say, he might try to ""cheat"" again in next November's election.

Asked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce what message she had for moderate Democrats worried a vote for impeachment might hurt them politically, Pelosi said she would not try to persuade them -- including ones elected in districts that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I have no message to them. We are not whipping this legislation,"" she said, ""nor do we ever whip something like this. People have to come to their own conclusions.""""I have no message to them ... people have to come to their own conclusions,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells ABC News' @marykbruce when asked what her message is to moderate Democrats who are concerned that a vote for impeachment could hurt them politically. https://t.co/l8K4Z1nnsy pic.twitter.com/MUh9Wt08oq— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 12, 2019

""They’ve seen the facts as presented in the Intelligence Committee – they’ve seen the Constitution, they know it – they take an oath to protect and defend it.  But they see the constitutional experts speak about it.  They’ll make their own decisions.  I don’t say anything to them,"" she said.

""The facts are irrefutable,"" she said. ""The fact is we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy used his weekly press conference to rail against Democrats, saying they’ve been determined to impeach Trump since he took office.

He said if Republicans were in the majority, they would “not use our power simply for the sake of dislike of another individual.”

He added that the impeachment process has “weakened the office of the president” and the idea of democracy.

“I wish they would take one pause and think as an American, what does it do to the country?” he said.

On the upcoming Senate trial, McCarthy said he is not concerned.

“If it goes over to the Senate I don’t think it should have to last that long because there are no facts there to uphold impeachment,” he said.

“The articles they have, I don’t think stand on any merit,” he said.

"Mike Bloomberg in 'outstanding health,' his doctor reports",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-bloomberg-outstanding-health-doctor-reports/story?id=67697023,"
Before he was mayor of New York City, in the midst of his first foray into politics, Mike Bloomberg had a heart procedure -- a fact he immediately reported to the Federal Aviation Administration so he could keep flying airplanes.

On Thursday, Dr. Stephen D. Sisson of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine described the 77-year-old billionaire as ""in outstanding health"" and ""great physical shape.""

""He exercises several times a week and plays golf avidly,"" Dr. Sisson wrote. ""There are no medical concerns, present or looming, that would prevent him from serving as President of the United States.""
Bloomberg had two stents implanted in a blocked artery in 2000, according to Sisson's letter.

The letter released by Sisson in concert with Bloomberg's campaign details that since the stents were placed, he's endured normal cardiac stress testing. Bloomberg's latest annual examination was in July.
About 434,000 Americans receive stents every year, according to the American Heart Association. Stents hold open arteries to clear blockages or improve blood flow. It's the same procedure Bernie Sanders had in October.

In 2018, Bloomberg developed atrial fibrillation, for which he now takes a blood thinner. He also takes a beta-blocker and medication to help control his cholesterol.
Bloomberg also has had small skin cancers removed and is under treatment for arthritis and heartburn, both of which, Sisson said, are ""well controlled.""

According to Sisson's report, Bloomberg is 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds. His blood pressure was within an expected range for a man his age.
The doctor's letter also mentioned that Bloomberg has an active pilot's license. In 2000, immediately after receiving his stents, Bloomberg notified the FAA, according to the candidate's campaign.
Sisson's letter also mentioned Bloomberg is a non-smoker without a history of substance-use disorder, and that his dietary and exercise habits are excellent -- calling to mind several decisions he made as New York City mayor, such as cracking down on public smoking and the consumption of sugary drinks.

Ultimately, as the Democrat continues on a strenuous, uphill trail toward the White House, his doctor declared him to be in ""outstanding health.""

Gabbard places bets on New Hampshire,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-moves-hampshire-candidate-places-bets-states/story?id=67504440,"
A two-day snowstorm wasn't enough to scare off Hawaii-native Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from New Hampshire. In fact, she's officially moved to the state.

While other candidates are focusing on Iowa, Gabbard is placing her bets on New Hampshire. Gabbard is one poll short of the four needed to qualify for the December debate stage; two of the qualifying polls were from New Hampshire.

At 5%, Gabbard was tied for fifth place in the Oct. 29 CNN/University of New Hampshire poll of likely primary voters in the state. However, nationally, she received just 2% support, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Nov. 3.
""We had a town hall in Rochester and then in Gilford right before the storm hit and people said, 'You must be getting out of town.' It was like, 'Nope, we’re here for the duration,'"" Gabbard told Manchester ABC affiliate WMUR.

During this week's storm, Gabbard posted pictures showing her doing yoga in her newly rented New Hampshire home as 2 feet of snow piled up outside.

She said she isn’t giving up on the other early voting states, saying she will be in South Carolina ""in a couple of weeks. But we look forward to spending a lot of time [in New Hampshire].""Rain, snow or sun ... it’s always a good time for #yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️ #TuesdayVibes pic.twitter.com/2QIOPAFmm4
Snow isn’t a foreign entity to Gabbard, despite growing up in Hawaii. She has spent several years on the mainland in Washington -- both as a congresswoman and a congressional staffer for the late Sen. Daniel Akaka -- and just this week braved the 20-degree weather marching in a holiday parade in Laconia, New Hampshire.

She did joke that Christmas this year will be a little different; ""I grew up in Hawaii where Christmas was you know 80 degrees and a day at the beach. And so being here for the winter, you know, the first snow of the year is always fun.""
Gabbard will likely spend the holiday season campaigning. New Hampshire is a unique state where 78% of likely primary voters said they are still trying to decide what candidate to support, or are leaning toward someone, but have not yet definitely decided on a candidate, according to the CNN/UNH poll.

Marty Prichard, an undecided voter in the state, said he's looking for a candidate who brings ""youth, new ideas and new concepts.""

""We're at a point in this country where things are very partisan within party lines,"" Prichard told ABC News after an event featuring South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Prichard said he’s looking for a candidate who can bridge that divide and only two candidates fit that bill: Buttgieg and Gabbard.
At a crowded town hall at Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire, in October, Gabbard acknowledged she had an uphill battle getting her name out there to voters. While 5% is enough to get her into debates, she remains well behind the favorites, even specifically in New Hampshire. Sen. Bernie Sanders, from neighboring Vermont, led in the October CNN/UNH poll with 21%, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from bordering Massachusetts, at 18%, former Vice President Joe Biden at 15%, Buttigieg at 10% and both Andrew Yang and Sen. Amy Klobuchar also at 5%.

""I don't have the same kind of high level of name recognition as somebody like Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, or others,"" she admitted.
In an attempt to fix the problem she has blanketed the state with billboards over the past year and said she’s received a good return on investment.

""We have folks coming to our town hall meetings, saying, 'Hey, I saw this yard sign,' or 'I saw this billboard and I thought, 'Huh I wonder who that is? And then I forgot about it. Then I saw another one, and another one, and another one and another one,'” Gabbard relayed.

While Gabbard is doubling down on New Hampshire, she's not the only one. Yang opened a campaign office in Manchester on Tuesday, marking his 75th event in the state. Buttigieg is beginning his 14th trip to the state on Thursday.

FBI director pushes back on debunked conspiracy theory about 2016 election,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-pushes-back-debunked-conspiracy-theory-2016/story?id=67609244,"
FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday undercut a theory pushed by President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies that the government of Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,"" Wray told ABC News in an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday.NEW: Asked about Pres. Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Rudy Giuliani and others, FBI Dir. Chris Wray tells @PierreTABC, “we have no information” supporting the theory. https://t.co/mYAwH5acs4 pic.twitter.com/2qiF6ZwKze— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 NEW: Asked about Pres. Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Rudy Giuliani and others, FBI Dir. Chris Wray tells @PierreTABC, “we have no information” supporting the theory. https://t.co/mYAwH5acs4 pic.twitter.com/2qiF6ZwKze
Wray is the most senior, currently serving, government official to undercut the claim -- pushed as recently as Sunday by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in an interview about the ongoing impeachment inquiry.
""Here's the game the media is playing. Because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election,"" Cruz said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

When asked about the claim, Wray urged Americans to be cautious about their sources of information.
""Well, look, there's all kinds of people saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information, to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear,"" he said. ""And I think part of us being well protected against malign foreign influence is to build together an American public that's resilient, that has appropriate media literacy and that takes its information with a grain of salt.""
In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump requested he look into claims about ""CrowdStrike,"" referencing a debunked conspiracy theory that claims Ukraine, not Russia, hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer networks in 2016.

Asked about that theory, Wray didn't directly respond to the president's claim but underscored that the FBI has no evidence to support such a claim.
""As I said, we at the FBI have no information that would indicate that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"" he said.

In addition, Wray said that he didn't speak with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, about any investigation into the Bidens.

""I haven't had any conversations with Rudy Giuliani,"" Wray said.

Wray also cautioned that election interference is still a concern moving into 2020.

""Well, as far as the election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat to the election cycle itself,"" he said.

""But we certainly know that other nation states, China, Iran, others have an interest in influencing our democracy in other ways through different forms of engagement, different types of malign foreign influence. So we are trying to make sure that we're working hard with others to protect America against all those threats,"" Wray added."
"As a POTUS candidate, Harris, a lawyer, struggled to present clear case: ANALYSIS",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-candidate-sen-harris-lawyer-struggled-present-clear/story?id=67469507,"
Kamala Harris was elected to the Senate the same day President Donald Trump won the White House. As soon as she got to Washington, there was buzz she would likely run to take him on in 2020.

Democratic Party leaders loved the concept of a Harris candidacy. An African American woman as the next potential nominee would be a bold, defiant choice after Hillary Clinton's presidential loss -- a chance to tell the country that their party was not backing down, but standing up in some way.

Her candidacy symbolized, albeit in maybe a simplistic way, the urgency Democrats feel around needing to reenergize diverse constituencies and the new face they hope to present the country.

Add in her smarts, charm and prosecutor bona fides, and it was easy to see why so many former Clinton campaign alums ended up on her staff.

Harris' campaign launch was easily one of the strongest this cycle. The impressive Oakland, California, crowd, the commanding speech and the coordinated rollout had all the markings of a team in tiptop shape and a candidate who knew what she was doing. The prospects of her winning her home state -- as many candidates are expected to do -- left her at the top of political number-crunchers' lists.
Winning hundreds of delegates in California, in a year where the state is so early in the cycle, could have been a game-changer. But as her chances of taking her home state looked less likely, she focused instead on Iowa. The Midwest, though, was far from a natural fit for her.

Starting off with high expectations can be a curse -- cue former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rouke. And in a crowded field, clear ideas and simple messaging are winning out -- just ask  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose campaign start was one of the rockiest of the bunch.

In 10 1/2 months of formal campaigning, Harris -- the lawyer -- struggled to present a clear case.

Why was she different than the candidate next to her? She could never define for voters what exactly a Harris presidency would look like. Sure, she would be a Democrat in the White House, but running on a sweeping list of party priorities, it started to seem like she was running on little at all, or at least little that was distinctive from her many peers.
Harris was also caught in a few tough flip-flops and wishy-washy answers early on, and did few sit-down interviews.

After first signing on to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" legislation in Congress, she tripped and stumbled when trying to walk back her support of the bill. Then, at the first Democratic debate in June, she raised her hand to a question about who would be comfortable eliminating private insurance. She backtracked after the fact, said she misunderstood the question, and promised to put out a plan of her own.

When she did lay out a plan -- trying to find a middle ground between a potential single-payer health care system and one that let many private insurance plans remain on the market too -- several health care experts were left scratching their heads. New York Magazine's headline read, ""Kamala Harris's Medicare For All Plan Makes No Sense.""

Time and again, voters reward candidates who stick to their guns and present clear values. Conviction on the issues can matter even more than the issues themselves.

But beyond questions dealing with health care, Harris hedged a lot of her answers in the spring and summer. When Warren pitched breaking up Facebook, Harris said, ""I think we have to seriously take a look at that.""
When she was asked about a controversial statement from Sanders -- that incarcerated felons should be able to vote -- she said, ""I think we should have that conversation"" and added, ""I'm going to talk to experts and I'm going to make a decision and I will let you know.""

As a former prosecutor, it was surprising when she did not have an outright opinion on some policies like legislation to ban chokeholds. And where she may have been able to create a compelling narrative around her evolution on drug crime sentencing and some specifics in criminal justice reform -- after all, a lot of politicians have moved on the issue of marijuana legislation, for example -- she instead faced skepticism from some younger African American voters about her role in law enforcement.

Harris' memorable moment on at second debate was the high point of her candidacy. She took on Joe Biden directly and personally on an issue from his past dealing with race.
""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me,"" she said.

And in that moment it looked like she had leagues ahead of the former vice president, speaking to the country today and making him look like a part of the past.

Her polling numbers shot up, but settled back down quickly. Over time she started to sound only one note on the stage. Her takedowns were masterful, but perhaps voters were craving someone who could build them up instead.

As her campaign plateaued, Harris's stump speech became even more about Trump.
Ironically, with the exception of Biden -- yes, a big exception -- the other front-runners have spent a lot less time talking about the president or why they are best suited to take him on. They talk about their visions instead.

Harris questioned whether her lagging poll numbers meant that Democratic voters, perhaps unfairly, were assuming it would be hard for her to win nationwide. During an interview with Axios this fall, she called her electability the ""elephant in the room.""

She had qualified for the next debate, making the timing of her exit surprising. As it happens, several candidates of color have not yet made the cutoff.

Yvette Simpson, CEO for Democracy for America and an ABC News political contributor, argued that candidates of color can face both concern among voters about whether they can lead as well as skepticism about whether they can win.

""It is a real catch-22,"" Simpson said. ""Issues of perceived electability are real. ... A lot of voters want to see if you can win before they will jump on board and help you win.""

Simpson argued that Harris also did not pick a lane in a race that is defined by policy lanes.

""She shifted more into a corporate, moderate Democrat lane and lost a lot of progressive support because of it,"" Simpson said. ""And she was judged more harshly than others. … Candidates of color have had a harder time taking on Biden in this race. Somehow Mayor Pete (Buttigieg) is automatically assumed to be the one to carry Biden's mantle forward -- why?"" "
Trump calls Canadian prime minister 'two-faced',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-mock-trump-world/story?id=67485796,"
A candid moment caught on camera of Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau casually chatting with other world leaders has stirred speculation that the Canadian leader was mocking President Donald Trump, who in response called the Canadian leader ""two-faced.""

In video of a conversation with French President Emanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte during a reception Tuesday evening at Buckingham Palace, Johnson can be heard asking Macron, ""Is that why you were late?""
Macron’s response is inaudible on the video, but Trudeau then chimes in with a remark.

""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top,"" Trudeau says.
It is not clear who Trudeau is referring to, and Trump’s name is never specifically mentioned throughout the video of the captured conversation..@JustinTrudeau, @EmmanuelMacron, @BorisJohnson and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday. No one mentions @realDonaldTrump by name, but they seem to be discussing his lengthy impromptu press conferences from earlier in the day. (Video: Host Pool) pic.twitter.com/dVgj48rpOP
Trudeau can later be heard saying, ""You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""
Earlier in the day, Trump took reporters' questions for 39 minutes during a photo-op of his bilateral meeting with Macron. Later in the day, the president held a separate bilateral meeting with Trudeau, during which the president engaged with the press seated next to the Canadian prime minister for a half-hour.

Asked by ABC News if Trudeau was referring to Trump and to what the prime minister was discussing, Trudeau's office declined to comment.

On Wednesday morning, when a reporter asked Trump about the video, Trump called Trudeau ""two-faced.""

But then he added: ""And honestly with Trudeau, he's a nice guy, I find him to be a very nice guy.""

Trump said that he had ""called him out on the fact that"" Canada is spending less than 2% of its GDP on defense, to which NATO leaders had agreed and which Trump has made a signature issue.

""The truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2%, and I guess he's not very happy about it,"" Trump said, adding: ""So I called him out on that, and I'm sure he wasn't happy about it, but that's the way it is.""

But as he sat next to Trudeau in front of reporters on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he was ""happy with Canadian defense spending as it is right now,"" and said he was ""satisfied"" with Canada's increased levels of spending.

""Well, they’re moving up, and they’re moving up substantially,"" Trump said. ""And they’re starting to do very well, economically. And that has something to do with it. And, yeah, they’re getting up to a level that's getting to be very acceptable. They have been under the 2%, obviously, but they’re moving up. We discuss it. I’m satisfied with it.""

Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's most recent statements about the Canadian prime minister on Wednesday."

Michael Eric Dyson on why Biden and Buttigieg resonate differently with black voters,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/author-michael-eric-dyson-breaks-2020-presidential-candidates/story?id=67491869,"
Author and Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson appeared on ""The View"" Wednesday where he spoke about why black voters might resonate more with former Vice President Joe Biden than South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and the key differences between them in the 2020 race.

Although the latest Iowa poll places Buttigieg ahead of the other Democratic candidates, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 39% of black voters said they preferred Biden as the 2020 nominee compared to 4% of black voters who backed Buttigieg.

""[Biden] hung out with a black guy for eight years,"" Dyson said, referring to former President Barack Obama. ""Black people appreciate the fact that he did that.""

But Dyson said ""Biden had bonafide days among black people before Obama came on the scene."" When speaking about a party that Biden held for Black History Month, he said, ""It was lit... Black people were vibing with [Biden], in a way.""
However, Dyson also referred back to the June Democratic debates, when Sen. Kamala Harris called out Biden for his record on race, specifically with regard to forced school busing.

Biden seems to be going through ""the typical experience of a white guy trying to grapple with race in America,"" Dyson said, adding that it's ""a very mixed bag going on there.""
Buttigieg, meanwhile, hasn't received the same support from black Americans. Dyson argues that he could still ""overcome"" that deficit in potential votes.

""What I like about him though, is the fact that when he was scathingly rebuked by a black reporter, he picked up the phone and called him,"" Dyson said of Buttigieg's phone call with ""The Root"" writer Michael Harriot regarding an article he wrote claiming the candidate is a liar. ""[Pete Buttigieg] engaged that.""

Dyson also raised the issue that less than 3% of business contracts in South Bend went to minority- and female-owned businesses.

""It's not just a physical, psychological thing; it's also structural,"" Dyson said. ""What is the money distribution like? How are you making justice a reality in terms of who you're giving money to?""

""Having said that, I do like his openness,"" Dyson said. ""I like his ability to be self-critical and introspective.""

Trump impeachment case enters historic next phase in House Judiciary Committee,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-case-enters-historic-phase-house-judiciary/story?id=67471278,"
The investigation into President Donald Trump enters a historic next phase on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the constitutional grounds for drafting articles of impeachment.
The process of drawing up any articles, now becoming increasingly likely, could begin shortly after members question legal and constitutional experts about what the Constitution requires.

Three witnesses have been called by Democrats: Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, and Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law.

Testifying for Republicans will be Jonathan Turley of The George Washington University Law School.
The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.
Expected to be highly contentious, the hearing comes a day after the House Intelligence Committee, led by Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, published its report on its investigation into alleged misconduct by the president in regard to Ukraine.

Much of the focus now will be on the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, and whether he can control Republican objections and maintain the momentum of the Democrats' impeachment drive -- an effort that Trump on Tuesday once again called a ""hoax.""

Trump has turned down an invitation from Nadler that he and his lawyers participate.

ABC News and ABC News Live will provide complete live coverage of Wednesday's hearing.

Senate Republicans increasingly favor short impeachment trial with no witnesses,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-republicans-increasingly-favor-short-impeachment-trial-witnesses/story?id=67666255,"
There's a growing consensus among Senate Republicans that President Donald Trump's all-but-certain impeachment trial should be shorter rather than longer, lasting roughly 10 days to two weeks, with no witnesses called by either side.

One senior GOP senator told reporters that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell favors a shorter trial with a vote on impeachment articles soon after arguments are made by both sides.
Indeed, McConnell telegraphed as much on Tuesday, telling reporters, “Here is what I would anticipate: The House managers would come over, make their arguments. The president’s lawyers would then respond, and at that point, the Senate has two choices: It could go down the path of calling witnesses and basically having another trial, or it could decide -- and again 51 members could make that decision -- that they have heard enough and believe they know what would happen and could move to vote.”
""I think the prospect of calling witnesses, in my view, seems unlikely,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Trump ally, adding, “As much as some people might like to complete the incomplete record, the premise of the whole impeachment process is so warped that completing a bad record doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. So my guess is that it will be as efficient as we can make it while not short-circuiting the process.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has expressed even greater concern about the possible consequences of calling witnesses.

""That really concerns me. It has the potential to be a real circus. I think you could have depositions like you had during Clinton,"" Cornyn said, referring to the videotaped depositions -- conducted away from Capitol Hill -- used in President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.

“I would think the consensus would be: let the House make their case, let the president make their case, and then put forward a motion to vote,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said, adding that witnesses were not needed, a position that appears to be at odds with one pushed more recently by the White House.

“I think people are starting to realize that could be a pretty messy and unproductive process,” Johnson said. “That’s kind of generally where people are headed.”

More senators are now voicing concerns that if Republicans called witnesses President Trump might want, like the whistleblower or Hunter Biden, then the door is also open for Democrats to call witnesses that could hurt Trump's case, such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.

“Witnesses cut both ways. We wouldn’t be the only ones to call witnesses,” the senior GOP senator warned, specifically pointing to Mulvaney as an example, adding, “We don’t know that (witnesses) would shed any additional light. We kind of know what the Hunter Biden situation is … So, what’s the point?”
The senator, who asked not to be named in order to discuss strategy more candidly, said he thought there was really only one impeachment article to focus on: the charge alleging that the president abused his power under the Constitution by asking that a foreign government aid him politically -- and that that is more an issue for the courts, rather than one to be argued in the Senate, particularly with witnesses.

“If you start opening up witnesses, you open it up to all witnesses. So, I think, the president has to really decide to what extent does he want to go down that road, verses making strong case,” Sen. Johnson said in a separate interview, adding that he’s “not sure a Senate trial is even the best way to do that.”
Johnson, together with his GOP colleagues, Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, are separately pursuing investigations into the origins of the 2016 Trump campaign probe.  Johnson and Graham say they think that is a far more productive avenue to explore.

“I don't want to prolong this trial any longer than necessary, there are ways to do oversight outside of impeachment,” Graham said. “I think the trial needs to end as quickly as possible, I think impeachment is hurting the country and I have no desire to make it a long trial. So I'm looking for 51 people to join me and say we've heard enough, we're ready to vote.""

Still, a small handful of GOP senators are holding onto the idea of full-blown trial.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked if he supports the idea of calling live witnesses, said, ""Within reason, I support giving both the prosecution and the defense relatively unfettered discretion to present their cases.""

""I want to see due process. I think the American people expect us to do what the House didn't do. The judicial philosophy in the House was 'guilty.' Speaker Pelosi gave the president a fair and impartial firing squad,"" Kennedy said. ""We're not going to do that in the Senate. We're going to afford both sides due process.""
Ahead of the expected full House impeachment votes next week, the Senate has ramped up talk of what a trial would look like.

Senate Republicans were joined at their weekly lunch Wednesday by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a staunch Trump ally, and House Intelligence Committee GOP staff counsel Steve Castor, who both have figured prominently in both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committee proceedings to date. A handful of senators asked questions, but one senator said they really learned nothing new.

“Did you watch Congressman Jordan at all during the hearings? Same thing. He was just as animated in there,” said GOP Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, who said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, was also supposed to join but was held up.

Senators said Jordan laid out, in his trademark passionate way, the key points of the case, as seen by Republicans.

"First 4 primary debates of 2020 announced, ABC News debate in New Hampshire",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/primary-debates-2020-announced-including-abc-news-debate/story?id=67463859,"
Democrats will kick off 2020 with four Democratic primary debates in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday. The debates will take place in January and February.

ABC News, in partnership with ABC's New Hampshire affiliate WMUR-TV and Apple News, will hold the first debate after voting begins on Friday, Feb. 7, at St. Anselm College in Manchester.

The early February face-off will mark the only debate this election cycle in New Hampshire, which hosts the country's first primary on Feb. 11.

CNN and The Des Moines Register will host a debate on Jan. 14 at Drake University ahead of Iowa’s caucuses. NBC News and MSNBC, in partnership with The Nevada Independent, hosts a Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas prior to Nevada's caucuses. CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute co-host the debate before South Carolina's primary on Feb. 25 at The Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina and Twitter will be a debate partner.

Five Democratic senators are currently running for president and have indicated they will return to Washington for an impeachment trial in the Senate should one take place.

With the possibility that the timing of the first 2020 debate could conflict with an impeachment trial in the Senate, Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC, said, ""If a conflict with an impeachment trial is unavoidable, the DNC will evaluate its options and work with all the candidates to accommodate them.""
The newly announced debates will be held over a pivotal stretch of January and February, when voters are likely to winnow the field through the first four contests. After that comes Super Tuesday, when more than one-third of total convention delegates available to candidates will be awarded.
In 2008, there were four debates in January, after the Iowa caucuses were held on Jan. 3 of that year, and a fifth debate on Feb. 2.

Last week, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak ended their presidential bids shortly after the last-minute entrances of former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and billionaire philanthropist and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The New Hampshire debate will air across ABC, WMUR-TV, which is owned by Hearst Television, Apple News and on ABC News Live, ABC's streaming channel available on the ABC News site, app, and OTT media services.

The DNC will release more details, including the qualifying rules, for the early 2020 debates at a later date. In 2019, the party imposed more rigorous qualifying rules as the primary season deepened -- oftentimes putting the committee at odds with the presidential contenders leading to lower-polling candidates being excluded from the stages.
This is the second debate hosted by ABC News following September's matchup at Texas Southern University, a public, historically black university in Houston, which was co-hosted with Univision. That debate featured a roster of 10 candidates, with former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two polling front-runners at that point in the primary, tangling on the same stage for the first time. They have since stood shoulder-to-shoulder at center-stage in every matchup succeeding that debate."
"Trump announces G-7 summit to be held at Camp David, following Doral club criticism",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-announces-summit-held-camp-david-doral-club/story?id=67463962,"
President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that next year's Group of Seven summit will take place at Camp David, after his administration's initial choice of Trump's own resort in Florida was widely criticized as self-dealing.

“We’re going to do it at Camp David,” Trump told reporters in London, adding attendees will be doing “special” things at the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains and praising the new location choice for being close to Washington.

The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, announced in October that the administration had selected Trump National Doral Miami resort, in southern Florida, as the host site for next year's G-7 summit. The members of G-7 rotate hosting responsibility for their annual gathering of leaders, and the United States was due to hold next year's summit.
But that decision was widely panned, with Trump criticized for directing a lucrative government contract -- and all of the potential marketing benefits that came with it -- to a resort he owned. Democrats accused him of self-dealing.
Two days later, after the blistering criticism continued, Trump reversed course, announcing that the search for a host site had been reopened and that Camp David was a possibility.
Mulvaney, though, was not a fan of Camp David.

When he announced that Trump Doral would host the summit, Mulvaney noted that ""they said it was a complete disaster"" when a previous summit had been held at the rustic site.
""I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,"" Mulvaney. ""It was way too small. It was way too remote.""
At the time, Mulvaney said the search for a host site had been narrowed to four possibilities: Aside from Trump Doral, he said, there was one location in Hawaii and two in Utah under consideration.

Camp David would not have been among those finalists, and it was unclear Tuesday why one of them they had not been selected.

Trump made the announcement during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a NATO leaders' summit in London."
"Amid impeachment, House Democrats push measure to lower cost of prescription drugs",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/amid-impeachment-house-democrats-push-measure-lower-cost/story?id=67653547,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Wednesday that later in the day the House would debate and then vote Thursday on a bill that she said would reduce prescription drug costs, the latest example of Democrats drawing attention to their legislative efforts while they pursue impeachment.

""I have seen grown men cry about how they cannot meet their families needs because of the crushing burden of prescription drug costs,"" Pelosi said Wednesday, announcing Democrats have the votes to pass the legislation.
Although Pelosi didn't mention impeachment, the drug cost bill announcement comes one day after House Democrats formally filed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and followed minutes later with a press conference on a modified trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

The legislation, titled the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act in memory of the late Congressman, seeks to reduce the high prices of prescription drugs by negotiating costs through Medicare and its vast bargaining power.

Unlike the trade deal, Trump,  who ran on a platform of lowering drug costs, opposes the measure.

The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Tuesday night, saying, ""If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto the bill.""

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md, joined Pelosi at the news conference and called directly on the Trump to follow through with his campaign promise by supporting the legislation.
""Mr. President, I urge you to come together as we have provided a bill consistent with what you said your polices were going to be,"" Hoyer said. ""No one should have to choose between medications they need or paying their rent or putting food on the table.""

The Democratic leaders quoted Trump more than once on Wednesday, from when he told a crowd at a campaign rally in Exeter, New Hampshire, in February 2016, ""When it comes time to negotiate the cost of drugs, we are going to negotiate like crazy.""
But as president, Trump appears to have changed strategies.

Anotherstatement released by the White House last week cited the potential for drug manufacturers to lose money and for fewer new drugs may to enter the market as some of the reasoning for not supporting the legislation.

""Heavy-handed government intervention may reduce drug prices in the short term, but these savings are not worth the long-term cost of American patients losing access to new lifesaving treatments,"" it read.

A preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office or CBO found that the core provision of the bill would save Medicare $345 billion between 2023 and 2029, but the legislation may reduce the introduction of new drugs to the market in the long-term, as Republicans have noted.
The bill to reduce drug prices also comes on the heels of the Trump administration's executive order signed in November that will require hospitals to disclose negotiated rates with insurance companies in 2021. The Democrats' bill takes that transparency a step further, extending negotiations into all Medicare plans. Those negotiated prices will then become available on private health insurance plans as well.
Other highlights of the AARP-endorsed legislation include a $2000 a year cap on out-of-pocket costs for all seniors on Medicare, an additional $7.5 billion to fight the opioid epidemic and reinvesting Medicare savings into the expansion of community health center, according to the speaker's office.

Two private citizens also joined House Democrats at Wednesday's event to share their stories: Caroline Corum, a registered nurse fighting breast cancer and Jim Riordan, a retiree struggling to pay for his $4800 asthma medication each month.

""Despite having good insurance, I live in fear of not being able to afford the medicine I need to treat my cancer,"" Corum said. ""Our lives depend on your vote.""

Riordan added after her, ""if [this] became law, I could literally breathe a sigh of relief.""

The day before, Trump considered Tuesday's announcement on the House's trade deal as a win for his base, according to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, despite the president berating House Democrats as ""do nothing"" in recent months. Pelosi has continued to combat that narrative.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday the Senate will not take up the trade legislation until after the near-imminent impeachment trial of the president has concluded.
""What is not possible obviously would be to turn to an impeachment trial or to do USMCA in the Senate before we break for Christmas,"" McConnell said Tuesday.

The bill's sponsor, Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., added at Wednesday's press conference, ""We're going to do this tonight and pass it tomorrow.""

Senate recognizes Armenian genocide over Trump White House opposition,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-recognizes-armenian-genocide-trump-white-house-opposition/story?id=67692138,"
In a historic vote, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution to recognize as genocide the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman-era Turkey a century ago, overcoming weeks of active opposition from President Donald Trump's White House as it convinced three Republican senators to block earlier votes.

The vote is sure to further roil U.S.-Turkish relations and upset the country's strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who, despite a warm relationship with Trump, has overseen a fraying between the two NATO allies.

This is the first time this kind of resolution passed the Senate -- unanimously, no less -- and weeks after a similar measure passed the House, 405 to 11. Lawmakers have said they're increasingly upset with the Turkish government for its offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces that fought with the U.S. against ISIS and its purchase of a Russian missile defense system that violates U.S. law and undermines the NATO alliance's security.
The resolution, for which the Armenian government and diaspora have long asked, officially recognizes the mass violence against and forced displacement of Armenian Christians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. As many as 1.5 million Armenians died. The modern-day Turkish government vehemently rejects the label of ""genocide,"" admitting atrocities took place, but saying there was no systematic campaign to exterminate Armenians.
After the House passed its resolution, Turkey's foreign ministry called it a ""grave mistake"" that ""will negatively affect the image of the U.S. before the public opinion of Turkey as it also brings the dignity of the U.S. House of Representatives into disrepute.""
The Trump administration had been urging individual Republican senators to block the resolution for weeks, even as Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reintroduced the legislation. The White House has said the timing of the resolution is inappropriate, just weeks after Erdoğan visited Washington, as he and Trump try to patch things up.

On three occasions, the administration was successful. Sen. Lindsey Graham blocked a vote on the day of Erdoğan's visit, Sen. David Purdue blocked one a week later and Sen. Kevin Cramer blocked one just last week -- even though he was a co-sponsor of a similar resolution in 2017.
Trump has praised Erdoğan and pushed for closer ties with Turkey, but lawmakers of both parties have sought to penalize its government for behavior they've said damages U.S. interests. At the top of that list is Turkey's offensive against the majority-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces that served as de facto U.S. ground forces against ISIS. That operation included potential war crimes by Turkish-backed opposition groups, according to the U.S. Defense Secretary and special envoy for Syria.

Critics, including prominent Republican senators, blasted Trump as giving a green light to Erdoğan for the assault, and after the U.S. and Turkey reached an agreement to halt it, Trump embraced the Turkish leader at the White House and removed any sanctions on senior Turkish officials.
The administration has also so far refused to sanction Turkey for its purchase of the Russian S400 missile defense system despite a 2017 law Trump signed requiring sanctions for any significant Russian defense purchases.

That softer approach to Ankara has fueled a stronger stance in Congress, including renewed support for the Armenian genocide declaration.

It's also gotten a boost from celebrity backers who are Armenian American.
Kim Kardashian West urged her followers to call their senators and ask them to vote yes on the resolution hours before the vote Thursday, writing in an Instagram post: ""Denial is the final stage of genocide.""

"Marine veteran among US citizens detained by ICE, ACLU says",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marine-veteran-us-citizens-detained-ice-aclu/story?id=67465583,"
In 2014, after serving in the Marine Corps for nearly three years, Jilmar Ramos-Gomez returned home to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he was born and raised, and found himself struggling with post-traumatic stress, not able to adjust to his new life as a civilian.

He says he reached a breaking point when he suffered a psychotic episode on Nov. 21, 2018, and was arrested by the Grand Rapids Police for trespassing on the roof of a local hospital.

Ramos-Gomez was not a patient but went there because he was struggling with his post-traumatic stress, according to Miriam Aukerman, his lawyer and a senior attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan.

Following his arrest, Ramos-Gomez was booked into the Kent County Correctional Facility, a jail in Grand Rapids.

An ACLU lawsuit says he was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without probable cause and held in a detention center for three days, despite his having -- and ICE knowing -- that he had multiple means of identification in his possession showing he was a U.S. citizen -- including a REAL ID driver's license and U.S. passport.

A statement later released by ICE says Jilmar Ramos Gomez allegedly told officials he was from a foreign country when he was in custody on Nov. 23, 2018. In its lawsuit, the ACLU asserts, however, that the evidence shows ICE officials had proof of his citizenship before and after they spoke to him.

ICE declined to comment on the case.

Ramos-Gomez is one of some 20,000 U.S. citizens detained by ICE over the past 10 years, according to the Cato Institute. ICE has declined to release any figures.
“There's been a ratcheting up of deportations and arrests by ICE over the last 10 years or so and these types of mistakes are to be expected but are unacceptable,” said Douglas Rivlin, director of communications for America's Voice, an immigrant rights advocacy group. “We expect very high standards from our federal officials but we are not getting the level of accuracy and competence that we need to get from our federal officials.”

The number is higher for lawful permanent residents, according to the Cato Institute. Data released by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a non-partisan organization that releases information about federal enforcement, show that, between 2008 and 2012, ICE issued detainer requests against 28,000 legal permanent residents.

Since ICE has not released documents or information on any of the detainer requests, the reasons behind issuing them are unknown.

“An LPR can be lawfully detained for removal purposes if they have a criminal conviction that makes them subject to deportation,” said Jennie Paquerella, director of immigrants' rights and senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. “The problem is that ICE often puts detainers on LPRs who do not have such convictions and sometimes no convictions at all.”

Pasquerella recently won a lawsuit that ruled that ICE's primary deportation program unconstitutional. The lawsuit, called Gonzalez v. ICE, is based on Gerardo Gonzalez, a natural born U.S. citizen who was issued a detainer request by ICE in 2012.

According to the complaint, ICE has subjected more than 2 million people to these unconstitutional arrests since the inception of the program in 2008.

“ICE is doing everything that they possibly can to prevent people who are in their custody from accessing attorneys, even from having their families know where they're being held,” Rivlin said. “It's a very secretive process.”
ICE declined to comment on the process federal officials have to follow when someone is detained. According to its website, facilities follow ICE’s National Detention Standards, which state that only “non-U.S. citizens who are apprehended and determined to need custodial supervision are placed in detention facilities.”

According to the ACLU lawsuit, when he was arrested, Ramos-Gomez not only had his U.S. passport and REAL ID driver's license, but also his Marine Corps identification tags. At the jail in Grand Rapids, the lawsuit says, an off-duty officer with the Grand Rapids Police Department emailed an ICE agent to check on his immigration status after seeing news of his arrest on TV.

The officer claimed he suspected terrorism but emails and exchanges between the GRPD officers and ICE officials published by the ACLU reveal, the group says, that the officer never indicated the issue was urgent or that it involved terrorism. In his email, the lawsuit says, he said only that he was concerned with Ramos’ immigration status.

The email resulted in ICE agents speaking to Ramos-Gomez in the Kent County jail, the ACLU says. And even though the agents reviewed his Real ID driver’s license and a database that listed Ramos’ birthplace as Michigan, the lawsuit says, he was nevertheless then sent to another immigration detention center in Michigan on Dec. 14, because ICE officials still believed he was undocumented.

“He's booked in and he has his REAL ID compliant license that shows he is a veteran and here lawfully,” said Aukerman, his attorney. “And while he's there, he does not get the care that he needs and so his mental health seriously deteriorates.”

When ICE started removal proceedings, the notice charges incorrectly stated that Ramos-Gomez was a Guatemalan citizen who arrived unlawfully in the U.S. While he was born in Michigan, his family is from Guatemala, but in their statement, officials did not provide an explanation for why they indicated he was not a U.S. citizen and, instead, from the Central American country. Before ICE could continue, Ramos-Gomez’s family attorney intervened.

An ICE agent then again reviewed and confirmed Ramos’ citizenship and he was released on Dec. 17, 2018, almost a month after his arrest.

Since his release, Ramos-Gomez says he is still suffering from the trauma of being detained and almost deported.

“If you had a judge who would have looked at this, who would have looked at the police reports and the information that was available, no judge would have signed off on a warrant,” Aukerman said.

Nearly a year after his arrest, the city of Grand Rapids settled a lawsuit brought by Ramos-Gomez, the city commission agreeing to pay him $190,000 for the department's involvement in his detention.

Following the settlement with the city, the ACLU along with attorneys at the Loevy and Loevy law firm filed a lawsuit and a complaint against ICE and the Department of Homeland Security alleging wrongful detainment of the Marine Corps veteran. The ACLU is seeking unspecified compensation for Ramos-Gomez and records pertaining to his detainment and data on other U.S. citizens and lawful residents who have been detained in the hopes this situation from happening to others.

“There needs to be accountability and transparency,” Aukerman said. “It’s unusual for ICE to actually acknowledge responsibility but with the lawsuit, they have a chance to decide whether they want to take responsibility for what they did or whether they want to fight it.”

Senator condemns Trump for pardoning servicemen,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trumps-pardons-disservice-military-members-sen-jack/story?id=67475925,"
A key Democratic senator said Tuesday that President Donald Trump did a ""serious disservice"" to military members by  pardoning several servicemen accused, or convicted, of war crimes last month.

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., took the opportunity during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing focused on privatized military housing Tuesday to express his ""deep concern about the president’s recent interference in war crimes cases.""
""The president has the power to pardon, but he has the responsibility to use that power wisely, not recklessly,"" said Reed.

""Some have claimed that these cases were a distraction and that the president’s intervention have somehow improved morale of the military,"" he added. ""On the contrary, President Trump's disregard for our military justice system risked undermining the confidence of our service members and the rule of law and their chain of command, especially those who are courageous enough to bring allegations of war crimes to light, and testify against their teammates.""
Last month, Trump pardoned Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was serving a 19-year sentence for ordering his men to fire on three Afghans, and Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who had been awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to murdering an Afghan man.

A broader controversy followed when Trump restored the rank of Navy Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, who had been convicted in the military justice system of posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter but acquitted of murder.

Trump later ordered the Navy to allow Gallagher to keep his status as a SEAL after news broke the Navy was reviewing whether he should keep the Trident pin that identified him as such.

Gallagher’s case led to the firing of former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, whom Defense Secretary Mark Esper had accused of going behind his back to broker a deal with Trump on Gallagher’s SEAL status.
Col. Dave Lapan and Dr. Kyleanne Hunter, both retired Marines, and retired Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, were critical of Trump’s decision to pardon the service members on Sunday’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos.""

""When the military becomes politicized, nothing good can come of it for long-term health of the military,"" said Hunter, who served as a Cobra pilot in multiple deployments.

""This president has often talked about how much he admires the military, how much he has done for the military; it's all about the strength of the military"" said Lapan. ""And I’d ask what these pardons have done to further that goal, rather than making the military stronger, I think he's weakened the military in these days.""

Lapan, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti, disagreed with Trump’s characterization in a tweet in October that said, ""We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill.""
The case of Major Mathew Golsteyn is now under review at the White House. Mathew is a highly decorated Green Beret who is being tried for killing a Taliban bombmaker. We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill! @PeteHegseth
""It was an inappropriate statement,"" said Lapan. ""I think when you say something like that, the president is not fully grasping that they are professionals, that they do have a set of standards and rules that they need to follow.""

At Tuesday’s hearing, Reed invoked a statement by the late Sen. John McCain.
""This is a moral debate. It is about who we are. I don't mourn the loss of any terrorist’s life,"" Reed said, quoting a McCain column from 2011 following the death of Osama bin Laden. ""What I do mourn is what we lose when by official policy or official neglect we confuse or encourage those who fight this war for us to forget that best sense of ourselves.

""Through the violence, chaos and heartache of war, through deprivation and cruelty and loss, we are always Americans, and different, stronger and better than those who would destroy us,"" he continued, before switching back to his own thoughts. ""That is the standard we should demand from our military men and women, and I believe the president’s interference in these cases has done them a serious disservice.""

"After 'well spoken' remark, Booker says he shouldn't have to school Bloomberg on race",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-bloombergs-spoken-comment-cory-booker-school-mayor/story?id=67567076,"
Cory Booker shot back at Mike Bloomberg after the former New York City mayor said the New Jersey senator was ""well spoken"" -- saying he shouldn't have to take him to school on race.

""It's not up to me to be his teacher on this issue,"" Booker told ABC News' Rachel Scott in an interview Friday afternoon in Grinnell, Iowa. ""It's not enough to say, ‘I'm not a racist.' If racism exists, you need to be an anti-racist. You need to be working every day on these issues.

""Whoever is our nominee should not have to be explained to about why comments like that could be found to be offensive to a very important part of our constituency,"" Booker added.

The back-and-forth between the 2020 presidential hopefuls comes less than two weeks into Bloomberg's entry into the race.

During an interview, Bloomberg, who is white, was asked about the lack of diversity in the Democratic field and the possibility of an upcoming debate featuring only white candidates. Bloomberg said he and Booker endorsed each other a few times.

""He's very well-spoken,"" Bloomberg said on ""CBS This Morning."" ""He's got some good ideas.""
Bloomberg later told ABC News that he ""probably shouldn't have used the word.""

""But I can just tell you, he is a friend of mine and he is a Rhodes Scholar, which is much more impressive than my academic background,"" he added, referring to Booker. ""I envy him. And he can certainly speak for himself.""
Following the suspension of California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign, Democrats have been met with a shrinking diversity on the campaign trail. As of Saturday afternoon, no candidates of color have qualified for the sixth democratic debate, set to take place in Los Angeles later this month.

Despite a concerted push to qualify for the Los Angeles debate, Booker still needs four Democratic National Committee approved polls to appear on the stage.

In the ABC News interview, Booker criticized the DNC for instituting ""artificial barriers"" that make it easier for billionaires to get on the stage.

""It's a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency, that has more billionaires in it than black people,"" he said in speech to supporters on Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa.

He also pushed back against DNC chair Tom Perez's argument that no candidate who has been under 4% at this point in the cycle has been able to win the primary.

Booker is not alone in urging for more diversity on the debate stage. Fellow presidential hopeful and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who is Latino, has also used the conversation to bring attention to his campaign.
The Dec. 19 debate will currently feature former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer.

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang both need one poll to make the debate stage. Candidates have until Thursday to qualify.
Following his controversial comments, Booker confirmed to ABC News that Bloomberg has reached out to him.

He said he still considers Bloomberg a ""friend"" and there is ""no beef,"" but Booker spoke of the importance of having leaders who ""can authentically connect"" to African Americans -- a critical base for the Democratic party.
""We all say things we shouldn't, but this is something our eventual nominee should know,"" he said. ""If they don't it is going to hurt them in our ability to win.""

President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday morning to Democrats that if they are going to impeach him, they should ""do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate.""
Trump's tweet came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she was instructing House Democratic chairmen to draw up articles of impeachment.
.....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.

Biden has said he won't testify voluntarily.

About an hour after Pelosi spoke, Trump reacted on Twitter.

They already gave up on the ridiculous Mueller “stuff,” so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President.... ...This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents.

   ....This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents. That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!
A top White House official said on Capitol Hill Wednesday that President Trump is demanding a full trial featuring live witnesses in the Senate chamber if and when the House sends over articles of impeachment to the Senate later this month.
After he arrived at the White House from his trip to London, President Trump tweeted late Wednesday night about his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Trump tweeted that when he told Zelenskiy, “I would like you to do us a favor though” that the “us” referred to the United States. ....”I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....” This, based on what I have seen, is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!).

  ....”I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....” This, based on what I have seen, is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!
House Democrats have alleged that Trump was asking Ukraine to investigate his political rivals for his own personal political benefit – not for the benefit of the United States.

When Trump last night noted that he brought up the U.S. attorney general, he neglected to mention that he later told Zelenskiy he wanted him to speak not only with U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, but also with his own personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Veteran who contemplated suicide reunites with Bernie Sanders,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veteran-contemplated-suicide-reunites-bernie-sanders/story?id=67610294,"
Sen. Bernie Sanders reunited Monday with a veteran who garnered headlines after telling the presidential candidate he was contemplating suicide due to being saddled with $139,000 in medical debt.

The Naval Air Force veteran, named John Weigel, told the Vermont senator and a crowd of attendees at a campaign-sponsored town hall in September that he didn’t know how he would pay for compounding medical debt for the treatment of Huntington’s disease.

""I can’t. I can’t. I’m gonna kill myself,"" Weigel told Sanders in their first encounter.

""Hold on, John, stop it, you’re not gonna kill yourself,"" Sanders replied.
Nearly three months later, Weigel attended another Sanders event to report that his medical debt was now under control. He said that he was now only paying $29.50 per month.

""Because of your support, Sens. [Catherine] Cortez-Masto and Jacky Rosen got involved and straightened out my bills,"" Weigel told Sanders and the crowd in Gardnerville, Nevada.
He later added, ""Thank you for rescuing me.""

Weigel attempted to give Sanders his flight jacket, but Sanders declined to take it. Instead, Weigel ripped his flight patch off the jacket and gave it to Sanders.
""As a nation, we can disagree about a war. We can disagree about foreign policy, but when brave people like John put their lives on the line to defend our country, when they come home, they will receive the best quality health care that this country can provide them,"" said Sanders. ""And they will not have to go deeply in debt or be harassed by bill collectors for some stupid bureaucratic reason.""

Sanders, who has made health care reform his central platform, previously released a plan that, if enacted, would cancel $81 billion in medical debt for millions of Americans, reform bankruptcy rules to allow for medical debt relief and prevent medical debt from impacting credit scores.

House Democrats counter GOP impeachment attacks by pushing drug bill,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-elevate-prescription-drug-bill-combat-gop/story?id=67690066,"
The House's moderate freshman Democrats, seen as some of the party's most politically vulnerable members, scored a legislative victory on health care Thursday, solidifying their argument that they can execute legislative priorities while also undercutting Republican claims that impeaching President Donald Trump thwarts progress for the country.

In between the hours of debate inside the House Judiciary Committee's markup of the impeachment articles, House Democrats passed a big-ticket piece of legislation, H.R. 3, aimed at reducing the price of prescription drugs. The vote, which was the culmination of a months-long effort to rally the caucus behind a single approach to lower drug prices, will do so by negotiating costs through Medicare and its vast bargaining power.

With centrist-minded Democrats wary of the political backlash of impeachment, the move bolsters their argument that they can still focus on and advance a comprehensive legislative agenda while simultaneously holding the president accountable for what they argue is an abuse of power. But the bill, not supported by Trump, is likely dead on arrival in the Senate.
The latest legislative accomplishment comes after a bruising few weeks for vulnerable Democrats, who have found themselves at the center of anti-impeachment attacks, including a $2.2 million anti-impeachment ad buy from the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action targeting 27 Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016.

Republicans are pouring millions into television and digital ads to capitalize on the Democrats' impeachment push. As ABC News has previously reported, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee launched a $10 million anti-impeachment ad blitz in September, with $2 million from the RNC targeting more than 60 vulnerable House Democrats in Trump-won or key congressional districts. Last month, conservative nonprofit American Action Network also launched a $7 million TV and digital ad campaign opposing the impeachment, including $5 million in TV ads across 20 congressional districts.
The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm, has also spent $90,000 so far on digital ads targeting Democrats for not ""getting anything accomplished.""

""Socialist Democrats' obsession with unilaterally removing Trump from office comes at the expense of getting anything accomplished for the American people and it will cost them their majority next November,"" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Chris Pack said in a statement to ABC News.

But now national Democrats are closing ranks around their vulnerable members by highlighting their policy bonafides to run counter to Republicans' massive impeachment offensive.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a new digital ad campaign, their opening salvo for 2020 backed by a mid-five figure buy, across the House battleground's swing districts.

""This targeted ad buy is a reminder that while House Democrats continue to put the priorities of the American people first, Washington Republicans once again showed they will always prioritize padding the pockets of their special interest backers over the people they were elected to represent,"" said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos.
The digital ads on Facebook will target voters across the congressional battlefield, which includes the DCCC's front-line members, the party's most vulnerable candidates up for reelection, and their top GOP targets. The ads, which underscore the efforts by House Democrats to continue to make health care a top election issue, will run in multiple languages, according to the committee.

The ad buy follows presidential contender and billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg lending a sliver of his personal fortune to the arms race on the current congressional battlefield.
On Wednesday, a senior aide to Bloomberg confirmed he will donate $10 million to the House Majority PAC to help defend vulnerable House Democrats, as they face a slew of well-financed Republican attacks on their support of impeachment against Trump. The latest move continues his long history of deep-pocketed donations to buttress candidates. In the 2018 midterm elections, he spent upwards of $100 million on House Democrats, supporting their efforts to flip the chamber.

The legislation passed Thursday, named the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act in memory of the congressman who died earlier this year, is a key plank of Democrats' 2018 winning campaign platform, which helped them overtake the House majority.
Trump, who campaigned on making lowering drug costs a top priority, opposes the measure, which passed 230-192 in the House with unanimous support from Democrats. The bill is not expected to make it through the Senate. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Tuesday night, saying, ""If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto the bill.""

Regardless of the GOP's lack of support for H.R. 3, Democrats are training their focus on the issues.

""Democrats are keeping our promises on health care,"" said Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez in a statement on the passage of H.R. 3. ""We’re working to lower drug prices for middle-class families and passing historic investments in Medicare, while Trump’s agenda spikes costs, jeopardizes protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slashes billions from Medicare and Medicaid. As Trump and Republicans break their promises at every turn, Democrats will keep working to improve the lives of everyday Americans.""

Trump signs executive order aimed at combating anti-Semitism on college campuses,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-signs-executive-order-aimed-combating-anti-semitism/story?id=67664647,"WASHINGTON -- 
President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aimed at combating anti-Semitism on college campuses, saying schools had an obligation to reject discrimination targeting Jewish people -- even as the president has been criticized for himself using anti-Semitic language.

The order states that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- which covers people who face discrimination for their race, color, or national origin -- shall apply to those who face anti-Semitic discrimination based on one or more of those factors. A senior administration official said the White House specifically had anti-Jewish discrimination on college campuses in mind.

""This is our message to universities: If you want to accept the tremendous amount of federal dollars that you get every year, you must reject anti-Semitism,"" Trump said before signing the order at a Hanukkah reception at the White House. ""It's very simple.""
The White House said the directive constituted a response to a rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States. It instructs federal agencies to rely on a definition from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance that describes anti-Semitism as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.""
The definition, posted on the State Department's website, cites examples that include criticism of Israel, such as claiming the state of Israel's existence is a ""racist endeavor.""

The broad definition seemingly could include forms of pro-Palestinian speech, although a senior administration official said the executive order ""includes a clear statement"" that it ""should be applied consistent with the First Amendment.""
The president himself has come under fire several times in the past for comments that have been criticized as anti-Semitic.

Most recently, in a speech to a pro-Israel group in Florida on Saturday, Trump evoked the stereotype of Jewish people as wealthy and greedy, telling Jewish attendees that they had ""no choice"" but to vote for him because they would not ""vote for the wealth tax"" supported by Democratic presidential candidates.
In another instance, in August, Trump said Jewish people who voted for Democrats were ""being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel."" The comments were criticized for alluding the anti-Semitic tropes portraying Jewish Americans of disloyalty to the United States.
And one of the speakers Trump invited to the front to make remarks at Tuesday's Hanukkah reception, pastor Robert Jeffress, has drawn criticism for the way he has talked about Jewish people.

Jeffress said in a 2010 interview that ""you can’t be saved being a Jew.""

Trump also invited Jewish members of Congress and supporters on to the front of the room, among them New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, an outspoken backer of the president as he faces impeachment.

Attendees sported yarmulkes with ""Trump"" written on them and broke out in a chant of ""four more years"" as the president finished speaking.

Trump campaign says impeachment makes them 'bigger and stronger',https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-impeachment-makes-bigger-stronger/story?id=67653973,"
Just hours after House Democrats announced two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, he held a massive rally in the crucial key battleground state of Pennsylvania Tuesday night, where his reelection campaign spoke confidently that inquiry is only boosting their 2020 prospects.

""It has been a motivating factor for the president's supporters,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein on the Powerhouse Politics podcast on Wednesday. ""The engagement with our voters, the donations that come rolling in online ... every time something like this happens, you've seen the president's campaign gets bigger and stronger and we raise more money.""
And in the 72 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially made the impeachment inquiry announcement in September, the campaign said it raised $15 million in small-dollar donations, including 50,000 new donors.
""In the end, no president wants to be impeached. Let's make that clear. Nobody, nobody wants to be impeached,"" Murtaugh told Klein. ""But the end result will be it's going to rebound and be detrimental for the Democrats who are running.""
While the campaign touts fundraising numbers as proof the impeachment probe will be a win for the president in next year’s election, polling suggests months into House Democrats' inquiry that large swaths of the American people still believe he should be removed from office.

In a new Monmouth University poll, 45% say that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave office while 50% say he should not be impeached and compelled to leave office.
And when asked how impeachment could impact the Trump campaign’s prospects of expanding their map in 2020, Murtaugh told Klein he’s confident not only will the president retain the 306 electoral college votes from 2016, but pick up new states along the way.

""We believe our floor is 306 electoral college votes,"" Murtaugh said, adding that the campaign sees Trump ahead in all the key states they monitor internally.
Murtaugh also told Klein that heading into next year, when Democrats start voting in primaries and there’s a potential Senate impeachment trial, the campaign will remain focused on capitalizing on the ""lifeblood"" of Trump’s reelection effort: rallies.
""We don't base our decisions on what we're going to do running the president's reelection campaign based on all the Democrats in Washington,"" Murtaugh  said. ""[The House Democrats'] articles of impeachment today and we have a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. That's their business.""

He added, ""We're running our own campaign.""

FBI director reacts to DOJ report,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-chris-wray-reacts-doj-watchdog-report/story?id=67605418,"
FBI Director Christopher Wray offered mixed reactions to a Justice Department watchdog report that uncovered ""serious performance failures"" on the part of agents involved in the Russia investigation but ultimately determined the bureau was justified in launching its probe.

In an exclusive broadcast interview with ABC News, Wray lamented ""actions described in this report that [he] considered unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution."" But, he said it was ""important that the inspector general found that, in this particular instance, the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization.""
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Monday released his 478-page report chronicling the circumstances surrounding the FBI's surveillance of members of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, including Carter Page, who had lived and worked in Russia. In his report, Horowitz asserted that the FBI decision to surveil Page was legal.
“We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek [surveillance] on Carter Page,” Horowitz wrote.

But the president and his allies have called it ""a major SPY scandal"" and accused those involved of working on behalf of the ""Deep State."" Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018 Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!
Wray did not respond directly to the president, but pushed back on the ""Deep State"" characterization of the bureau's work.

""I think that's the kind of label that's a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage,"" Wray said. ""So that's not a term I would ever use to describe our work force and I think it's an affront to them.""
Horowitz's report described a series of major errors and omissions related to the surveillance application targeting a former Trump campaign aide that ""made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.""

""In my view, every error and omission is significant and it's something we need to take seriously,"" Wray told ABC News.
The president and his allies have long alleged that the Trump campaign was illegally spied on, aggressively accusing both the Obama administration and the FBI of carrying out what Trump has called ""one of the biggest political scandals in history.""

Asked whether he thought the FBI unfairly targeted the Trump campaign, Wray offered a blunt assessment: ""I do not.""
Attorney General William Barr made headlines in April 2019 when he told a Senate panel that ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign, adding there was a need to ""explore"" whether the probe was ""adequately predicated."" Wray has previously said ""spying"" is ""not a term I would use,"" and on Monday reiterated that point.
""Again, different people have different colloquial terms,"" he said, "" but we use terms like ‘investigation' and ‘surveillance.'""

Wray also pushed back on a widely debunked theory put forth by the president and his allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election – and sounded the alarm on the Kremlin’s plans for the 2020 cycle.

“We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,” Wray said, adding that “as far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.”

Wray took over the FBI's top spot in August 2017, months after James Comey's dismissal from the position. After releasing his report Monday, Horowitz is expected to face lawmakers on Wednesday in a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Speaker Pelosi asks House to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-make-formal-statement-impeachment-inquiry/story?id=67514548,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she has instructed House Democrats to draw up articles of impeachment of President Donald Trump, saying he had abused his power.

""Sadly, but with confidence and humility ... today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,"" Pelosi said.

""The facts are uncontested,"" she said. ""The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security by withholding military aid and a crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into his political rival.""
""His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution,"" she added. ""Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice but to act.""

""If we allow a president to be above the law, we do so at the peril of our republic,"" she said.Speaker Nancy Pelosi: ""Our democracy is what is at stake.

The announcement tees up a House floor vote in the coming weeks that would make Trump just the fourth president in American history to face an impeachment vote, and the third to be impeached by the House of Representatives.

""In America, no one is above the law,"" Pelosi said.

""The president has engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections. His actions are in defiance of the vision of our Founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States,"" she said.

About an hour later, Trump tweeted his first reaction, saying that Democrats are focused on impeachment after they ""gave up on the ridiculous Mueller 'stuff.'"" He said that impeachment is rarely used and suggested impeaching him will set a bad precedent for future presidents.....This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents. That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2019
....This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents. That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!
She declined to say whether any aspects of the Mueller investigation should be included in the articles of impeachment, saying she would wait for the recommendations from the chairs of the six committee chairs who have investigated Trump. ""I'm not going to talk about that,"" she said.

She added, ""This isn't about Ukraine. This is about Russia,"" asking ""Who benefits ... from that withholding of military assistance?""

""All roads lead to Putin. Understand that,"" she said, as she has previously.
And she pushed back on criticism that Democrats are rushing to judgment -- that a decision on impeachment should wait until all potential witnesses are subpoenaed and court challenges resolved.

She said the White House blocking key witnesses from testifying amounted to obstruction of justice and Congress.

Asked about whether there was a timetable to have a House floor vote on impeachment before Christmas, she said, ""We are proceeding in a manner worthy of the Constitution.""

And when asked whether she was concerned such a vote would divide the country, Pelosi answered, ""We don't take any glee in this. It's heartbreaking.""

Referring to Trump, she said, ""He's the one dividing the country. We are honoring the Constitution.""

As Pelosi spoke, the Judiciary Committee announced it would meet Monday to ""receive counsel presentations of evidence"" from the House Intelligence Committee.

Pelosi's announcement comes after several constitutional law experts told lawmakers that the president had abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically.
On Wednesday, three constitutional law professors selected by Democrats told the House Judiciary Committee that Trump's conduct towards Ukraine warranted impeachment. A law professor chosen by Republicans argued that there wasn't yet sufficient evidence to meet the constitutional standard and that Democrats were rushing to judgment.
After the hearing, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said he believed the conditions for impeaching Trump had been met.

Pelosi delivered the statement from the same spot where she first announced the start of the Ukraine impeachment inquiry in September. She privately discussed moving impeachment with her caucus and leadership team on Wednesday.
There were no objections in the room, when Pelosi asked Democrats ""are you ready?"" to move forward with proceedings, according to sources familiar with the meeting.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., defended Democrats' deliberations, and pushed back on the suggestion from Republicans that a vote would be premature.

""This is not rush to judgment,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of information over two and a half years from a lot of different sources, including the Mueller report.""

While Democrats are still divided over the nature and scope of possible charges against Trump, House Judiciary Committee Democrats suggested they could pursue articles on abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress.

On Monday, attorneys with the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee will present evidence for impeachment before Judiciary Committee members, suggesting that elements of the Ukraine and Mueller investigations will be taken into account in the drafting of articles of impeachment.

Members of the House Judiciary Committee have advocated adding elements of the Mueller investigation to the impeachment probe, though it's unclear if it would form the basis of a single article, or buttress a broader obstruction charge.

""It is that it's the pattern, a repeated pattern of conduct of obstructing justice, of obstructing Congress, of witness tampering of abuse of power, and typically an article is not around a topic area like Ukraine, it's around the high crime and misdemeanor,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a member of the committee, told ABC News. ""So you could imagine, potentially, bringing in things from the Muller report that are the same pattern.""

Other members of the caucus, including many of the moderate freshmen from districts formerly represented by Republicans, said impeachment should remain focused on the Ukraine episode.

""My thoughts on that haven't changed. The fact that this was a potential abuse of power by the president related to national security and foreign assistance funds during an active war in Europe … was unprecedented and remains very shocking,"" said Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger.

Crow, along with six other freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds, wrote a Washington Post op-ed in September warning of the national security implications of Trump's actions towards Ukraine that led, in part, to Pelosi's decision to open the inquiry.

""That is the thrust of the inquiry and it should remain the focus of the articles,"" he said.

Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., another moderate Democrat, said keeping the articles of impeachment focused on Ukraine would help clarify proceedings for the American people.

""I just think it makes it confusing to the public,"" he said. ""It looks like an expansive witch hunt on the part of Democrats because you're bringing up the old stuff that didn't have any water. Just keep it real tight, I think that's more convincing to the American people and people back home.""

For Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said the Ukraine charges are a ""slam dunk,"" and could be voted on quickly while the committees continuing investigating elements of the Mueller report and seeking access to documents and witnesses in court.

""You'll still have the committees doing their due diligence on lots of other things that the president's done that many of us truly believe is illegal, but this one is just so clear cut there's no reason to hold off on dealing with it,"" he said.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., one of two Democrats to vote against the resolution launching the Ukraine impeachment probe, said Thursday that ""nothing's changed"" for him, and he anticipates voting against what Democrats bring forward.

""If there was something new or different that I felt was truly impeachable, that would be a different situation. I have not come to that point,"" he said.

Trump campaign will no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters at events,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-republican-national-committee-bans-bloomberg-news/story?id=67445248,"
President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee have issued a ban on all reporters from Bloomberg News attending future rallies and campaign events.

The new policy will no longer permit representatives from the news company to be credentialed at events, and the campaign will determine on a case-by-case basis whether they will respond to specific inquiries from Bloomberg reporters, according to a statement from the campaign.

The decision comes as Bloomberg News grappled with how to cover its own founder and CEO, Michael Bloomberg, who recently launched a presidential bid.

In a memo to the Bloomberg News staff, Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait announced that the news outlet will cover their founder's presidential campaign; however, they will not pursue any in-depth investigations of Bloomberg. The hands-off investigation policy was extended to the rest of the Democratic field but not to the president’s reelection campaign.
Trump campaign officials, who have been weighing how to respond for the past week, called it a bias decision.

""Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis,"" Brad Parscale, the president’s reelection campaign manager, wrote in a statement.
Parscale noted the policy is set in stone until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.

The Republican National Committee, which has worked in lockstep with the Trump campaign on its reelection efforts, quickly backed the decision and committed to no longer giving credentials to Bloomberg News reporters at its events.

Bloomberg’s senior adviser, Howard Wolfson, responded to the news on Twitter, writing, ""one week in and Mike is already under Trump' skin.""One week in and Mike is already under Trump' skin. https://t.co/jyIBVXUToj
In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Micklethwait stood by his decision.

""The accusation of bias couldn’t be further from the truth,"" Micklethwait said in a statement. ""We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.""

DOJ watchdog to release report on Russia investigation origins: What you need to know,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-inspector-general-release-report-russia-investigation-origins/story?id=67546825,"
The long-awaited Department of Justice Inspector General report examining the origins of the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is set to be released Monday, in a moment sure to draw intense political scrutiny on the activities of law enforcement agents tasked with probing contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.

The investigation by Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, first announced in March 2018, initially sought to examine the circumstances surrounding the FBI's surveillance of a then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page -- who had lived and worked in Russia.
Horowitz's review questioned the role that a controversial ""dossier"" played in the FBI's investigation, a compilation of memos authored by former British spy Christopher Steele that included claims that Page and other Trump campaign officials were colluding with Russians to assist President Donald Trump in his White House run while boosting his businesses.
In October 2016, the FBI filed a surveillance warrant with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court against Page, and provided a series of materials to the court that agents said supported their belief that Page was ""the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government,"" according to a since-declassified copy of the application.

A since-declassified copy of the warrant indicated its monitoring of Page's communications was part of a broader investigation of Russia's alleged efforts to, ""undermine and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in violation of U.S. criminal law.""

The FISA application was renewed a total of three times, each time with the approval of Republican-appointed judges, before it was allowed to expire in September 2017.

While Horowitz's investigation was initially believed to be narrowly targeted in its review of the Page FISA application, it expanded over the past year and a half into a broader review of the conduct of senior FBI and Department of Justice officials in the early days of the Russia investigation. Horowitz's original mandate noted that, ""if circumstances warrant, [he would] consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.""

According to sources familiar with the review, Horowitz looked into whether FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who privately exchanged anti-Trump text messages while working on the Russia probe, were guided by politics in their official actions. He also probed whether senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr improperly tried to influence the probe by sharing Steele's information with the FBI, even though the agency had already received much of Steele's information from elsewhere.
Attorney General William Barr has additionally announced a separate investigation led by U.S. attorney John Durham looking at the conduct of intelligence agency officials who initiated the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.

The scrutiny has provided political fodder for many Republican lawmakers who have argued the investigation into the Trump campaign was tainted by political bias. Trump has taken that claim even further, repeatedly suggesting without evidence that Horowitz's review will be explosive and validate his unfounded claims that senior FBI and DOJ officials were looking to undermine his campaign and eventually sabotage his presidency.

""I predict you will see things that you don't even believe,"" Trump said in October. ""The level of corruption -- whether it's (former FBI Director James) Comey; whether it's (former FBI agent Peter) Strzok and his lover, (former FBI lawyer Lisa) Page; whether it's so many other people -- (former FBI deputy director Andrew) McCabe; whether it's President Obama himself.""

Horowitz delivered a draft version of his report the Department of Justice in mid-September, and ABC News confirmed last month that it includes at least one criminal referral. The referral alleges former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith altered a document related to Page's FISA application, though sources emphasized that the alleged alteration did not have had any material impact on the overall appropriateness of the FISA warrant.

Sources say Horowitz's draft report is hundreds of pages in length and includes significant criticism of the conduct of FBI and DOJ officials involved in the investigation, however Horowitz is not expected to argue that the decision to launch the investigation was without proper cause.

Horowitz will testify regarding his findings before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, and committee chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham has said he expects the inspector general will personally make ""recommendations as to how to make our judicial and investigative systems better.""

Republicans are expected to seize on the report as validating some of their long-expressed concerns about the investigation amid the backdrop of the ongoing impeachment inquiry over the alleged pressure campaign by President Trump to have Ukraine announce an investigation into 2020 presidential political rival and former Vice President Joe Biden..

In Tuesday's impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary committee, Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz suggested, without providing evidence, that Horowitz's report would be so damning that it would shift the focus of impeachment to former President Barack Obama.

""If wiretapping political opponents is a political offense, I look forward to reading that inspector general's report because maybe it's a different president we should be impeaching,"" Gaetz said.
With Durham's investigation still ongoing, it's unlikely Horowitz's report and testimony will provide any definitive closure for critics of the investigation like Gaetz and President Trump.

""As you know, the big one that's going to come out is the Durham report,"" Trump told reporters last Wednesday. ""And I don't know Mr. Durham. I've never spoken to him. But he's one of the most respected law enforcement or U.S. attorneys anywhere in the country. He's a tough guy.""

It's unclear whether Durham has uncovered significant information beyond what Horowitz found, though in late October ABC News confirmed that his investigation had formally turned into a criminal probe, at least in part due to the criminal referral of Clinesmith, sources say.

The move provides Durham powers that Horowitz lacked, such as convening a grand jury and issuing subpoenas for witnesses and documents.

But it has also been a source of concern among Democrats who have cast Barr as an unreliable and partisan attorney general, who has made clear through his public statements of his skepticism to how the investigation was handled.
""I assumed I'd get answers when I went in and I have not gotten answers that are, well, satisfactory,"" Barr said in a May interview. ""In fact probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that- that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened.""

A source familiar with the process said that Barr is not currently expected to offer a formal response to the Horowitz report upon its transmission to Congress that the DOJ at times includes with IG reports critical of the department.

Simple questions about the Trump impeachment hearings answered,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-hearings-quid-pro-quo-trumps-defense/story?id=66944239,"
As hearings in the impeachment inquiry enter a new phase with the House Judiciary Committee this week, here’s everything you need to know about allegations against President Donald Trump, his defense, and why the phrase “quid pro quo” is dominating the debate:

It started with a single whistleblower, who last August warned that in a July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump pressured the new government to launch a politically charged investigation.
Trump wanted two things: First, he wanted Ukraine to prove a theory that its own corrupt politicians in 2016 tried to sway American voters in favor of Democrat Hillary Clinton. (While some Ukrainian politicians did support Clinton over Trump in largely public ways, U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate inquiry found that Russian operatives -- at the behest of their government -- engaged in a far more widespread, invasive and secretive campaign to sway voters in support of Trump.)

Second, Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate one of his 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

The whistleblower described his colleagues on the call as “deeply disturbed” by Trump’s demands and detailed an internal effort internally to “lock down” all records of the discussion.

Since that bombshell allegation was made public, other witnesses have corroborated the person’s account and the White House released a summary of the call that describes Trump asking Ukraine for a “favor” and to investigate the Bidens.
“Quid pro quo” is Latin meaning “something for something.” The term is used in employment law, for example, to prohibit sexual harassment, and under federal laws against bribery.

When it comes to foreign policy though, such negotiations are actually quite common when the U.S. demand is tied to America’s national security interests. One example is asking a country to tackle corruption before receiving U.S. assistance.

In the case of Ukraine, however, the alleged quid pro quo wasn’t about national security but about dangling U.S. money and a presidential summit at the White House in exchange for investigating a political rival.

By the time Trump had asked Ukraine’s president for a “favor” on the phone on July 25, he had already suspended nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid. Advisers to Trump wanted the aid released because it was needed by Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression. They also wanted a White House summit between the two leaders to show U.S. support for the new government.

As one Army officer assigned to the National Security Council – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman – testified, Trump was pressuring a foreign power that desperately needed America’s help in exchange for its willingness to target U.S. citizens for the president’s personal gain.

“There was no doubt” about what Trump wanted, Vindman told Congress.

Trump has denied anything was wrong with the phone call, insisting it was “perfect.” Some Democrats, though, compare it to extortion.

The short answer is that it doesn’t matter if the act is illegal when it comes to impeachment.

Impeachment is a political process enshrined in the Constitution. It essentially provides a pathway for elected lawmakers to remove presidents whose actions are considered such a gross abuse of power that elected officials don’t want them to finish out their term.
And while the Constitution references “high crimes and misdemeanors,” the founding fathers didn’t necessarily interpret that to mean a violation of U.S. law. As Benjamin Franklin, in a 1787 speech put it: Without impeachment, the only “recourse” for the American public in dealing with a leader who had “rendered himself obnoxious” was assassination. And allowing for impeachment under the Constitution would give America a way to examine misconduct without resorting to violence.

On the question of whether Trump broke any laws, political campaigns are prohibited from taking anything of value from a foreign national. But the Justice Department declined to pursue the case because it didn’t have evidence that campaign finance laws were violated; officials told reporters it would have been difficult to “quantify” what Trump would have gotten from Ukraine in return.

As for facing criminal prosecution, the Constitution doesn’t say whether a sitting president can be charged in office, and the Justice Department has long had a policy that it shouldn’t happen because it would undermine the executive branch.

Trump and GOP lawmakers initially insisted there never was a quid pro quo with Ukraine and that the original whistleblower was motivated by politics. After several witnesses testified that they a presidential summit -- and possibly military aid -- was tied to Ukraine's willingness to investigate the Bidens, Republicans countered in a report released on Dec. 2 that there was no hard proof Trump was acting specifically to sway the 2020 campaign. (Trump’s intention with Ukraine would require the president or his closest aides to testify, but the White House has declined to cooperate with the inquiry.)
They also argue that Ukraine eventually received the money it wanted. While it's correct that the administration promised to release the aid on Sept. 11, by that point the White House was already alerted to the whistleblower complaint and Democrats had already announced an inquiry into what they called Trump's ""Ukraine scheme.""

But another key argument by Republicans could stick. They note that Democrats have been talking about impeachment since Trump took power in 2017. GOP lawmakers say the latest inquiry is just the most recent – and coordinated effort – to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

As the 2020 election inches closer, it will become harder for Democrats to argue that they need to act, rather than let voters decide at the polls.

But what about Biden? Isn’t it fair for Trump to investigate?

At the center of Trump’s allegation is a widely debunked theory that Biden – as vice president under President Barack Obama – delivered his own quid pro quo to Ukraine to help his son, Hunter, who was serving on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma.

It’s correct that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid if Shokin wasn't removed. But according to testimony by U.S. envoy Kurt Volker and others, Biden’s position was in line with U.S. policy and backed by other international powers that agreed Shokin was ignoring corruption and needed to go.

Volker also testified that it was ""quite possible"" that Ukrainian gas executives believed they were ""buying influence"" through Biden's son by putting him on the board of Burisma. The vice president's son was paid to serve on the board (at one point, his firm collected $166,666 each month from Burisma as both Hunter Biden and his associate sat on the board), and State Department official George Kent testified he warned about a perceived conflict of interest.
But no evidence has surfaced that Joe Biden acted to help his son, nor that his Hunter Biden violated any laws, and the Bidens deny any wrongdoing. House Republicans suggest in their Dec. 2 report that Democrats should acknowledge the ""perception of potential wrongdoing"" by Hunter Biden serving on Burisma's board while his father led U.S. policy fighting Ukrainian corruption.

After weeks of both closed-door and open depositions, Democrats have moved into the next phase of the impeachment inquiry (here is a list of who testified and what they said).

On Dec. 3, Democrats were expected to release their summary of events, laying out in detail evidence that suggests the president used his power in office for personal gain and to attack a political rival.

Then on Dec. 4, the inquiry shifts to the House Judiciary Committee, which will hear from lawyers who will testify on whether Congress has grounds under the Constitution to impeach. For the week of Dec. 9, the Judiciary Committee has invited a Democratic lawyer and Republican lawyer to present their cases. It was unclear as of Tuesday whether the White House would participate.

After that the Judiciary Committee may draft articles of impeachment and vote on them, followed by a full vote in the House, which requires a simple majority.

Impeachment doesn’t force presidents out of office. It’s more like a political black eye delivered by the House that kicks off a “trial” in the Senate.

If that happens, a group of House lawmakers -- all Democrats – would essentially act as prosecutors and argue the case before the Senate. Trump and his legal team would have equal time to put on their defense, with the Senate acting as a kind of jury.

If at least two-thirds of the nation’s senators vote against Trump, he would be removed from office – a high bar in a Senate currently controlled by Republicans. (The Senate doesn’t have the power to send a president to jail, only oust him.)

One big concern for Democrats – and a reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to be initially reluctant to consider impeachment – is that Trump could be impeached by the House, only to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate and possibly come back stronger politically as his base rallies to his defense.

That’s what happened in 1998 when Democrat Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath to try to hide an extra-marital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. While the GOP had clear evidence of the wrongdoing, he was acquitted by the Democratic-controlled Senate and saw a boost in his approval ratings.

(President Andrew Johnson also was impeached and acquitted by the Senate in 1868).

To hear Democrats tells it, nothing less than the soul of the country is at stake.

“There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,” said Rep. John Lewis., D-Georgia, on the House floor last September. “To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.”

Republicans like Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry disagree.

“I believe it was inappropriate. I do not believe it was impeachable,” he recently told ABC’s “This Week.”

As for Trump, he says it’s nothing more than “the Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!”

Rep. Elijah Cummings' daughters back aide over his widow in race to fill seat,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-elijah-cummings-daughters-back-aide-widow-race/story?id=67493366,"
The late Rep. Elijah Cummings’ daughters, Jennifer and Adia Cummings, have endorsed his longtime aide Harry Sparks, over the congressman's widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, in what is shaping up to be a crowded race to fill his seat.

“My sister and I are supporting Harry Spikes for Congress because for the past 15 years he’s worked alongside our father to meet the needs of the people of the [Maryland] 7th Congressional District,” Jennifer Cummings, 37, said in a statement provided to ABC News. “Harry knows this community. Our father often said of himself that he was ‘an ordinary man called to an extraordinary mission,’ and Harry embodies that same spirit.”
The race for the 7th Congressional District--which includes a large swath of Baltimore-- is packed with high-profile names. Rockeymoore Cummings, the congressman's widow, stepped down from her position as the Maryland Democratic Party chairwoman to run for the seat. Kweisi Mfume, the former president of the NAACP who previously held the seat, also announced he would compete to return to Congress.

“His memory and spirit to fight back and fight on is alive and well and here with us today,” Mfume said at his early November campaign launch. “I need you with me. I need you with me because like you, like you, all of us believe in the American right to clean water, to clean air, to a good education for children no matter where their zip code or what their surname is… I ask all of you to join me in this fight.”
Mfume also ran for an open Maryland Senate seat in 2006, but narrowly lost the primary to Ben Cardin.

Rockeymoore Cummings, Spikes, Mfume and Cummings’ daughters all eulogized the congressman at his Oct. 25 funeral. Spikes highlighted the leadership qualities that he admired most in Cummings.
“The congressman once told me that a true leader shares leadership. To get the ball down the court to win, share the ball, give others the opportunity to lead,” Spikes said in his eulogy. “If he were here the congressman would tell me, ‘Harry, remember to be greater than your pain. Transcend darkness and become the light to lead to better days. Continue to fight when all hope is lost.’”

According to Jennifer Cummings, Spikes represents the next generation of leadership.

“Harry, as one of the youngest candidates in the running, also has the unique ability to build a multigenerational and diverse coalition of support,” Cummings said in her statement. “Dad wanted as many freshmen members assigned to his committee as possible because he believed in preparing and passing the baton to the next generation.

“Dad would say, ‘This isn’t about me. This is bigger than me.’ And Harry knows the mission to serve is bigger than him-- it’s about the people of Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Howard County.”

Cummings was the chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee. Neither Spikes nor Rockeymoore Cummings responded to ABC News' request for comment.
In addition to candidates with national recognition, nearly two dozen other Democrats are running in the special election to represent the district, including a number of statewide lawmakers. State Sen. Jill Carter, and Del. and Majority Whip Talmadge Branch and Del. Terri Hill are also running for the safely Democratic seat.

The special primary election to replace Cummings is slated for Feb. 4. The special general election will be Apr. 28, the same day as Maryland’s 2020 primary election.

Trump aides weigh embracing swift Senate trial following House impeachment: Sources,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-considers-swift-senate-trial-house-impeachment/story?id=67686375,"
As the House Judiciary Committee headed toward a historic vote in favor of impeachment on Thursday, some top aides to President Donald Trump appeared to be warming to the idea of a short trial in the Senate and possibly not calling any witnesses at all, according to multiple sources familiar with internal deliberations.

The approach runs counter to what Trump has advocated publicly and what some aides have discussed. But according to sources familiar with discussions, the thinking inside the White House has begun to morph following the release of two articles of impeachment.
The articles, which allege abuse of power and obstruction of justice, were more limited in scope than the White House had anticipated, officials said. Meanwhile, top Republicans in Congress have signaled little appetite for a protracted trial, leading some presidential aides to consider urging Trump to allow a swift Senate trial and move past impeachment altogether, officials said.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and because no firm decision had been made.
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met behind closed doors with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland.

""The president did nothing wrong,"" Ueland told reporters afterward. ""It's a fatally flawed process and distracts from the work of the American people.""

When asked if the White House believed calling witnesses in the Senate trial was necessary, Ueland told reporters, “I think the president has been pretty clear on priorities that he’s laid out when it comes to this. But while we focus on the questions of how best to deal with the process in the Senate, we’re also focused on substantive results on the President’s agenda for the American people.”
Earlier this month, Trump said he wants several witnesses to testify who he says would bolster his account of events. Included on his list is his political rival Democrat Joe Biden and Biden's son, Hunter, who worked on a board of a Ukraine gas company while his father led U.S. policy on Ukraine as vice president. No evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced, and Hunter Biden has said he regrets the perception of a conflict of interest.

""I want them to testify but I want them to testify in the Senate where they will get a fair trial,"" Trump said earlier this month.“What did Hunter Biden do for the money?” @SenJohnKennedy A very good question. He and Sleepy Joe must testify!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2019 “What did Hunter Biden do for the money?” @SenJohnKennedy A very good question. He and Sleepy Joe must testify!
According to one source familiar with the president’s thinking, the president is waiting to make a final decision until he sees the finalized articles after they are voted out of the House Judiciary Committee, expected later Thursday.

Another official described the White House as being in a wait-and-see mode, with aides looking to keep their options open with a likely trial still weeks away, saying it's premature to say definitively what the White House approach will be.

""Whatever else happens in the Senate, it needs to provide the president with the fairness and due process that was denied to him in the House by Speaker Pelosi and Chairmen Schiff and Nadler,"" a senior official said.

Witnesses or not, one thing still in flux is who would represent the president in an impeachment trial. Sources tell ABC News any team would consist primarily of lawyers from the White House counsel’s office however it is possible outside counsel could be added, including the presidents lead personal counsel Jay Sekulow.  Rudy Giuliani, who held an active role in representing the president during the Mueller investigation has been sidelined from working on the impeachment case, sources have previously told ABC.
As reported last night, multiple sources tell ABC the president and his top advisers are considering adding attorney Alan Dershowitz, who appeared with Trump at a White House Hanukkah celebration Wednesday evening. His past client list includes Jeffrey Epstein, O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson. No final decision though has been made.

Supreme Court weighs dismissal of New York gun rights case,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-weighs-dismissal-york-gun-rights-case/story?id=67435712,"
The first gun rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court in nearly a decade boiled down to a debate over whether there's still a case at all.

The New York City law in question -- which had banned the transportation of licensed, locked and unloaded handguns outside city limits -- was voluntarily rescinded last year and New York state later passed a new law mandating that no such restrictions ever be re-imposed.

The justices on Monday appeared narrowly divided on whether there is still a reason to get involved at the request of gun rights groups or dismiss the appeal altogether.
""What's left of this case?"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Paul Clement, the attorney for gun rights groups challenging the law, asserting the first question at Monday's oral arguments.

""Petitioners have gotten all the relief they sought,"" she said, in her first public appearance on the bench since a health scare and hospitalization last month.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor was similarly skeptical.

""You're asking us to opine on a law that's not on the books anymore,"" Sotomayor told Clement.
""I don't think it's bad when people who have an argument settle their argument,"" interjected Justice Stephen Breyer.

The National Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations, backed by the Trump administration, insist the argument is still very much alive. They want court to expand Second Amendment protections to explicitly include transport of lawfully possessed arms to a second home or gun range.
""We'd like something more than (the city's) representations to protect us in the future,"" Clement told the court, asking for an authoritative ruling.

""They didn't get all that they wanted,"" Justice Samuel Alito said of the plaintiffs. ""They wanted a decision that this law is unconstitutional period.""

Justices Neil Gorsuch criticized New York for what he said was an attempt to evade the Supreme Court review by repealing the contested law after the justices agreed to hear the appeal.

There were ""Herculean, late-breaking efforts to moot the case,"" Gorsuch said.
Chief Justice John Roberts may be the decisive vote in the case. During questioning, Roberts signaled that he might consider dismissing the case so long as anyone who may have been found in violation of the now-defunct New York law wouldn't be penalized.

""Is there any way a finding of mootness would prejudice future options in this case, including damages?"" Roberts asked Richard Dearing, the attorney for New York City.

Gorsuch asked Dearing to guarantee that there would be ""no collateral consequences to individuals who had violated the city's prior ban"" if the case is dismissed.

""Absolutely none,"" Dearing said. ""On the record; on behalf of the city of New York.""

Hundreds of gun safety advocates braved pouring rain and cold temperatures to rally outside the court, voicing support for dozens of state and local gun restrictions passed in recent years. The advocates worry that an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling could undermine that progress."
Pentagon IG opens review into $400 million border wall contract,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-inspector-general-opens-review-400-million-border/story?id=67672426,"
The Pentagon Inspector General has opened a review of a $400 million border wall contract after a congressman alleged that the Trump administration could have had an ""inappropriate influence"" on the award.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) earlier this month awarded a contract to Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. to build border wall along the southern perimeter of the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in Yuma County, Arizona.
In a letter to the Pentagon IG after that award, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), said President Donald Trump had ""personally repeatedly urged"" USACE to award the contract to the Fisher Sand and Gravel.

Thompson also cited reports that Jared Kushner, the president's son in law, and DHS officials had shown support for the North Dakota-based company.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations.
""These actions raise concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence on USACE's contracting decision,"" Thompson wrote. “Therefore, I am requesting that you review the award of this contract to ensure that the bid submitted by Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. met the solicitation standards and that USACE made the award in accordance with federal procurement law and regulations.”

In a statement on Thursday, Glenn Fine, the acting Pentagon IG, said his office intends to initiate an audit of the solicitation and award of the $400 million contract.

""The Office of the Inspector General has significant experience evaluating the award of Department of Defense contracts,"" Fine said. ""We will conduct a full audit of the award of this contract.""

An administration official with knowledge of the contract told the Washington Post last week that Fisher’s price tag of approximately $13 million per mile was lower than the two other companies that bid on the contract and that Fisher's contract met the technical specifications of USACE's request.

Tommy Fisher, the CEO of Fisher Sand and Gravel, has repeatedly appeared on Fox News, talking about his company's proposal to build the president's border wall.

Fisher Sand and Gravel did not respond to an immediate request for comment.

"Romney: 'No evidence' Ukraine meddled in 2016, but 'ample evidence' Russia did",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mitt-romney-evidence-ukraine-meddled-2016-elections-ample/story?id=67473053,"
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah again broke ranks with fellow Republicans and said, based on testimony he's heard from various American officials, he doesn't believe there's evidence to suggest Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections.

""I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from our representatives today from the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind that suggests Ukraine interfered in our elections,"" Romney said on Tuesday. ""We have ample evidence that Russia interfered in our elections.""
His comments come after the No. 3 State Department official, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he wasn't aware of Ukraine meddling in 2016.

""Are you aware of any evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election?"" the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, asked Hale during a committee hearing Tuesday.

""I am not,"" Hale replied.
Many Republicans, in both the House and the Senate, have continued to peddle the widely debunked theory that Ukraine did interfere in 2016, despite the intelligence community's clear assessment Russia was responsible.

At the Kremlin's direction, Russian intelligence services waged a pro-Trump disinformation campaign on social media and secretly stole tens of thousands of private emails from the Democratic National Committee, the U.S. intelligence community concluded.

The White House's former top Russia expert, Fiona Hill, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee last month as part of the House impeachment inquiry, also said the theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is ""a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""
GOP Sen. John Kennedy notably tripled down on Monday, telling reporters he believes Ukraine meddled in the election -- based on what he's read in the paper.
""I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,"" Kennedy said, holding up articles from the Financial Times, the Economist and The Hill. ""I don't think this is fake news. I think these pieces were all well-researched, and it is clear to me that Ukraine did meddle in the U.S. election.""'

Romney, on Tuesday, pushed back against Kennedy's assertions, cautioning Republican colleagues to be wary of conspiracy theories.

""We have to adhere to the facts presented to us by our intelligence community,"" Romney said. ""I know some people will look at newspaper accounts and say, 'Gee, this is what I read in the newspaper,' but you know not every article is exactly accurate, and sometimes your articles are being promoted by an intelligence source that is trying to push a narrative that that is not in our interest.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demurred when asked if he believed Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""The intelligence committees have the ability to look at any of these suggestions,"" McConnell said during a press conference Tuesday.
The Senate Intelligence Committee looked into the allegations and found no evidence of Ukraine meddling.

""The Senate Intelligence Committee spent years looking into this. The conclusions were unanimous that Russia interfered in our 2016 elections,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the committee's top Democrat, said Monday.

""Thank goodness, at least, Mr. Trump's own intelligence and law enforcement appointees recognize this threat, have validated this threat and are actively trying to pursue countermeasures against Russia,"" Warner added. ""I just wish all of us would get on the same page and recognize that threat still exists, and we have to be united.""

Even the president's top Republican ally in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, said Tuesday he's seen no evidence suggesting election interference by Ukraine.

""I have no knowledge that the Ukraine did anything to interfere with our elections other than the press reports,"" Graham told reporters, ""and to suggest that we know that, I think, would be a stretch, because I don't think anybody does."""
Key takeaways from Judiciary impeachment hearing,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-house-judiciary-committees-1st-hearing-trumps/story?id=67495621,"
The impeachment inquiry moved to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday with a panel of constitutional scholars tackling the million dollar question in the debate: Do President Donald Trump's actions warrant impeachment under the Constitution?

Three of the witnesses were lawyers handpicked by the Democratic majority: Pamela Khan, a professor at Stanford Law School; Michael Gerhardt a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law; and Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School.

The lone Republican-picked witness was Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.

Here's what you need to know about the hearing:

The Democratic-picked lawyers say Trump is what the framers had in mind with impeachment

Among the three Democratic-picked lawyers, there was no doubt: Trump, they testified, abused his power in office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival. And soliciting a foreign power for personal and political gain was exactly what the framers had in mind when they tucked impeachment powers into the Constitution, they said. If left unchecked, the president could continue to invite foreign powers to help his upcoming election, the lawyers argued.
""We three are unanimous,"" Gehardt said, when they were asked if Trump's actions amount to a ""high crime and misdemeanor,"" as identified in the Constitution.
""If Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution's carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,"" Gerhardt said in his opening statement. ""No one, not even the president, is beyond the reach of our Constitution and our laws.""

The most colorful examples came from Karlan, who described being so riveted by witness testimony in the impeachment hearings that she opted for a mail-order turkey this Thanksgiving so that she could spend her time combing through the details. One ""chilling line"" by Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony, she said, was that Trump didn't need Ukraine to pursue a corruption case against Democrat Joe Biden, but rather just announce one.

""This was not about whether (former) Vice President Biden actually committed corruption or not. This was about injuring somebody who the president thinks of as a particularly hard opponent,"" she said.
Karlan also compared Trump's actions with Ukraine to a president withholding disaster aid for a state.

""Imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding,"" Karlan told the panel.

""What would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, I would like you to do us a favor. I'll meet with you, and I'll send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.""

The GOP-picked lawyer had a somewhat surprising argument against impeachment

Turley, who testified during President Bill Clinton's impeachment inquiry 21 years earlier, gave an unusual argument on behalf of Republicans and against impeachment. He didn't defend the president's actions or Trump himself. Turley noted he doesn't support Trump politically and even voted against him in the 2016 election. He did say he's a longtime friend of Trump's attorney general, William Barr.

But Turley also argued that Democrats were setting a dangerous precedent that could one day be used to smear one of their own.
""I get it. You're mad,"" he told the panel in his opening statement. ""The president's mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad.""

Impeachment though won't lessen that anger, he warned. Turley said he didn't think Trump's actions were a ""clear case of bribery"" and that Democrats should wait for the courts to weigh in on their demands for more documents and witness testimony.
Democrats have said they can't wait because Trump's actions present a ""crisis"" that must be addressed.

""That's why this is wrong,"" Turley said of impeachment. ""It's not wrong because Trump is right. … It's wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president.""

He urged Democrats to consider what they will do ""when the wind blows again perhaps for a Democratic president.""

""Where will you stand then?"" he asked.

A conservative congressman attacked the panel as elitists

In perhaps the most explosive exchange of the day, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz attacked the panelists summoned by Democrats as politically motivated elitists and noted their past contributions to progressive campaigns.

According to records by the Federal Election Commission, Karlan has donated money to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's current presidential campaign, and Gerhardt donated money to both of President Barack Obama's election campaigns. Karlan also testified to having supported Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Gaetz, the conservative firebrand and provocateur who at one point crashed closed-door impeachment testimony, accused Karlan of living in ""the ivory towers of your law school."" He also criticized Karlan for making a joke about the president's teen son, Barron Trump.

Earlier in the hearing, Karlan was explaining that the Constitution was written in a way to make the U.S. president behave differently than a king, specifically excluding titles of nobility.

""While the president can name his son 'Barron,' he can't make him a baron,"" she said.

When it was Gaetz's turn to question the witnesses, he jumped on the remark as an attack on a ""minor child.""

""That does not lend credibility to your argument,"" Gaetz said. ""It makes you look mean. It makes you look like you are attacking someone's family.""

Karlan said she did not have contempt for conservatives and added, ""I have a constitutional right to give money to candidates.""

She later asked to apologize for alluding to Barron Trump.

""If I can say one thing, I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president's son. It was wrong of me to do that,"" Karlan said. ""I wish the president would apologize for the things he's said wrong, but I do regret having said that.""
Republicans tried to throw sand in the gears early on

Republicans immediately tried to throw a wrench in the works with demands of procedural inquiries and roll call votes to force testimony from other witnesses.

The theatrics on Wednesday succeeded in slowing down the pace of the hearing and hammered away at a key GOP talking point: The impeachment process is unfair, the Republicans have said repeatedly.
Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the panel, opened the hearing by saying the Democratic quest for impeachment didn't start with Russia or election meddling but rather when liberal voters refused to accept the 2016 election results.

""This is not an impeachment. This is simply a railroad job and today's is a waste of time,"" Collins said.

Roles were reversed during Clinton's impeachment

A poster standing in the hearing room quoted longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler, now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, in 1998 making the same argument Republicans are pressing now -- that impeachment is unfair because it attempts to undo the results of a national election.

Nadler indeed railed against GOP impeachment efforts at the time, when Clinton was impeached for lying under oath to try to hide an extra-marital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

""There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other,"" Nadler said at the time of Clinton's impeachment. ""Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come. And will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.""
On Wednesday, Nadler said one big difference between the two presidents is that Trump has refused to cooperate, noting Clinton's willingness to provide a blood sample to be tested for DNA at one point.

""President Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document, and directed every witness not to testify. Those are the facts before us,"" he said.
Turley, the Republican-picked witness who also testified in 1998, noted that both impeachment proceedings were driven by hyper partisanship.

""The stifling intolerance for opposing views is the same,"" Turley said.

Pentagon official sexually harassed staffers: IG,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagons-top-wmd-official-sexually-harassed-female-staffers/story?id=67690218,"
A top defense official sexually harassed three female staffers before ultimately resigning from his post last April, according to a report from the Pentagon Inspector General's office released on Thursday.

The official, Guy Roberts, was the assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs -- as well as a former Marine Corps infantry officer, judge advocate and staff officer.
In the report, the Pentagon IG said it found that Roberts ""engaged in a pattern of misconduct in which he sexually harassed women on his staff"" to include ""deliberate, unwelcomed physical contact of a sexual nature by hugging, kissing, or touching.""

He also created a ""hostile, intimidating, and offensive work environment for women"" on his staff by making ""deliberate, repeated, and public comments of a sexual nature to members of his staff in meetings and in a town hall forum,"" according to the report.
Roberts told the IG he disagreed with the report's conclusions and that it was not his intent to sexually harass the female employees, but he did acknowledge some jokes he made ""were inappropriate."" After taking into account his response to the report, the IG decided it would not alter its conclusions and said it stands by the findings.

The investigation into Roberts' conduct was opened after one of his female employees issued a complaint back in February. During conversations with some of the 18 witnesses interviewed throughout the investigation, the IG identified two other female employees who were also allegedly sexually harassed by Roberts.
The first employee said Roberts hugged and kissed her when they were alone, even whispering ""I love you"" in her ear and touching her thigh during a social event. That employee also said that Roberts invited her on dates for dinner and drinks, made comments to her about him living alone in an apartment without his wife -- which she perceived as an invitation to be alone together -- and expressed his desire to see her in a bikini.

The employee told the IG that she expressed to Roberts numerous times that she found the behavior inappropriate and told him to ""stop.""
The second and third employees alleged similar unwanted touching -- with the second employee saying Roberts routinely commented on her ""looks.""

Both employees told the IG that they did not report Roberts' behavior because of concerns that it could damage their reputation or negatively impact their careers.

“As a young female growing up in this business, you have to, whether right or wrong … be careful about what you say,"" the third employee said, according to the report.
Asked about the investigation's results during a Pentagon briefing on Thursday, chief spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said he was not aware of the report.

According to his Defense Department biography, Roberts was the principal adviser to senior Pentagon leadership on matters concerning nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, stepping into the role in November 2017.

When he abruptly resigned last April, a Pentagon spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for Roberts’s departure in a comment to Foreign Policy.

“The department’s commitment to modernizing the department’s nuclear force and closely cooperating with allies and partners remains unwavering, and will result in the increased defense of the nation,” said Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a department spokesperson. “We appreciate [Roberts'] service to the department and wish him continued success.”

Because Roberts has already left his post, the IG said they would give the report to the office of the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, for inclusion in Roberts' personnel file.

Financial executive tapped for soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/atlanta-financial-executive-kelly-loeffler-fill-vacant-georgia/story?id=67488262,"
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced Wednesday that he's appointing financial executive and Republican donor Kelly Loeffler to the state's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat.

""Today, I'm proud to announce that conservative businesswoman and political outsider Kelly Loeffler will be Georgia's next U.S. Senator,"" Kemp said, standing next to Loeffler, in a press conference in Atlanta. ""From the farm to the New York Stock Exchange, Kelly has really lived the American dream, and I'm confident that she will work every single day to keep that dream alive for our children, grandchildren and for the generations of Georgians and Americans to come.""
Kemp added, ""Like our president, Kelly is ready to take on the status quo, the politically correct and the special interests. She knows that Washington is fundamentally broken. She knows that we need to drain the swamp.""
Loeffler, who will be the first Republican woman to represent Georgia in the Senate, said she was ""humbled"" to be chosen, but added that she has ""a lot of work to do to earn the trust and support of my fellow Georgians."" She advocated strongly for Trump's agenda and against the ""socialist gang in Washington,"" which she said includes Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

""So here's what folks are going to find out about me: I'm a lifelong conservative, pro-Second Amendment, pro-Trump, pro-military and pro-wall,"" she said to applause. ""I make no apologies for my conservative values and I look forward to supporting President Trump's conservative judges. I am strongly pro-life.""

She added, ""Not every strong American woman is a liberal. Many of us are conservatives and proud of it.""

Over 500 Georgians applied for the seat. Kemp chose Loeffler over Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee and a fierce defender of President Donald Trump's in the ongoing impeachment saga. The president had called Kemp multiple times over the past few weeks to urge him to tap Collins, sources familiar with the effort previously told ABC News, but this past weekend, Kemp began telling lawmakers he'd decided on Loeffler, according to a source with direct knowledge of the decision.

Just Monday, Trump tweeted support for Collins, writing that he did a ""great job... over the weekend in representing the Republican Party, and myself, against the Impeachment Hoax!""

Loeffler will join the Senate after three-term Sen. Johnny Isakson formally retires on Dec. 31.

In a press release Wednesday, Isakson said serving in the Senate was ""the honor of a lifetime"" and congratulated Loeffler on her appointment.

""Kelly’s business experience and acumen will be an asset to Georgia and the Senate. The same tireless work ethic that has helped her succeed in business will also help her succeed in serving Georgians and our nation,"" he said.

In order to finish out his six-year term, though, she'll have to win a special election to be held on Nov. 3.
When she runs in the special election, she could help regain support among suburban female voters who have drifted from the GOP in recent cycles, inching historically red Georgia into battleground territory.

After the close 2018 gubernatorial race between Kemp and Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, of Georgia, said at a Washington Examiner summit, ""(Kemp) spent almost no energy trying to reach suburban and exurban women and he came close to losing.""

But she could still face a primary challenge from Collins, who on Sunday, didn't rule out running in the special election.
In an interview on Fox News, when pressed by the host about potentially running against Loeffler, Collins said, ""Let's see what the governor does first... if he does (choose Loeffler), then that'll be a decision we have to make at that point.""

In a statement to ABC News Wednesday, Collins said he respected Kemp's decision and congratulated Loeffler on her appointment.
""I appreciate the support I have received from the president and many others, and right now, my primary focus is defending our president against partisan impeachment attacks,"" he said.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threw his and his Republican colleagues' support behind Loeffler, calling her a ""terrific appointment"" for Georgia Senate.

""She will be an incumbent Republican senator and we will all be behind her,"" McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""I'm going to be behind her, and I'm confident that someone we're working with every day is going to enjoy almost total support within the Republican Senate conference.""

Loeffler is the co-founder and CEO of Bakkt, a Bitcoin futures trading platform, and a co-owner and co-chair of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream team, and she and her husband, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange Jeffrey Sprecher, are big Republican donors.

Together, they gave more than $1.5 million to the super PAC backing then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. And more recently, according to FEC filings, they each gave a $35,500 contribution, the maximum amount per year, to the Republican National Committee, plus an additional $39,500 donation each to the RNC's convention account.

In her application, which was submitted just ahead of the deadline, Loeffler called herself a ""lifelong Republican,"" and said she'll ""stand with President Trump, Senator David Perdue and (Kemp) to Keep America Great.""

But despite pledging to stand with the president, Kemp faced backlash from some Republicans as reports broke that he would pick Loeffler.
Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of the president's strongest allies on the Hill, on Friday called out the governor on Twitter, saying that appointing Collins would be the way to support Trump and his agenda.

""If you substitute your judgement for the President’s, maybe you need a primary in 2022,"" Gaetz wrote. ""Let’s see if you can win one (without) Trump."".@realDonaldTrump told you how to be supportive: Appoint @RepDougCollins. You are ignoring his request because you THINK you know better than @POTUS.If you substitute your judgement for the President’s, maybe you need a primary in 2022. Let’s see if you can win one w/o Trump https://t.co/vtjT4CyLMI
Kemp's press secretary, Cody Hall, pushed back against Gaetz, saying he's not the governor.

""A record number of Georgians elected @GovKemp to serve - and he’s doing it with sky-high approval numbers,"" he wrote."
'Artificial barriers' winnowing Democratic presidential field: Sen. Cory Booker,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cory-booker-kamala-harris-billionaires-race/story?id=67567954,"
Days after his Senate colleague Kamala Harris suspended her presidential campaign, Sen. Cory Booker decried the ""artificial barriers"" winnowing the Democratic presidential field, and argued that voters in Iowa and elsewhere should be determining the candidates' success.

""Something's wrong with the system,"" Booker, D-N.J., told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos during an appearance on ""This Week,"" noting that other metrics, such as a campaign's field organization or endorsements, were being discounted in favor of fundraising and poll numbers.

Mired in the low, single digits for much of the year and facing the prospect of missing this month's debate in Los Angeles, Booker maintained optimism about his chances, pointing to the campaigns of Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama, who came from behind to capture the Democratic nomination.

""This country is a testimony to the constant achievement of the impossible. So, we're doing like a lot of candidates have done in the past that were discounted by national media and press,"" he said, adding that in the aftermath of Harris' decision he's had a strong fundraising week and required ""overflow rooms"" for his campaign stops..@GStephanopoulos pushes back: Candidates who are ""not that wealthy"" are ""staying in and doing better,"" while billionaire Steyer is ""pretty far back."" Booker: ""It's not just billionaires. It's the fact that Iowa voters should have the right to choose."" https://t.co/mFDcD5A9yo pic.twitter.com/9P3yj6TmU6— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 8, 2019 .@GStephanopoulos pushes back: Candidates who are ""not that wealthy"" are ""staying in and doing better,"" while billionaire Steyer is ""pretty far back."" Booker: ""It's not just billionaires. It's the fact that Iowa voters should have the right to choose."" https://t.co/mFDcD5A9yo pic.twitter.com/9P3yj6TmU6
The New Jersey senator -- one of only two African American candidates remaining in the Democratic field -- campaigned in Iowa this weekend under a spotlight after Harris suspended her presidential campaign on Tuesday.

Booker lamented Harris' exit and the Democratic primary's waning diversity at his first Hawkeye State stop in Des Moines on Thursday.

""It is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party -- a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters -- didn't have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa,"" he said. ""It is a problem that we now have an overall campaign for the 2020 presidency that has more billionaires in it than black people.""
As he did with his own campaign, Booker compared Harris to a presidential campaign predecessor on ""This Week"" Sunday, noting that she was in a similar situation to John Kerry in 2004, but that Kerry was able to lend his campaign the funding to continue -- ultimately capturing the party's nomination.

""Kamala Harris cannot loan herself $5 million,"" Booker said. ""Kamala Harris stopped her campaign because of the campaign finance rules and the fact that she couldn't do what we see billionaires doing in this race, which is flooding ads to jack up their poll numbers and get in (to the debates).""

One of those billionaires, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, created controversy this week when he invoked Booker while addressing the field's diversity during a CBS interview that aired on Thursday morning. After describing the senator as ""well-spoken,"" Bloomberg faced backlash from critics who argued the comment was a racist trope. The former mayor later acknowledged he ""probably shouldn't have used the word,"" and on Friday Booker shared with ABC News his disappointment with the incident.

""It's not up to me to be his teacher on this issue,"" the senator said. ""Whoever is our nominee should not have to be explained to about why comments like that could be found to be offensive to a very important part of our constituency.""
Along with former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Booker's campaign has been particularly outspoken about the racial makeup of the participants in December's debate in Los Angeles. As of this weekend, only six candidates have gained entry to the debate, all of whom are white. Booker, who has reached the fundraising threshold to gain entry, is still four qualifying polls of 4% shy of qualification ahead of next Friday's deadline.

Booker joked on Thursday with supporters about how they can ensure his involvement in future debates.
""I'm asking you, when your caller I.D. is showing that some pollster's calling you, pick up the phone and answer, please,"" he said. ""Choose me. Choose us.""

As some Democrats raise concerns over the electability of the presidential field's candidates, the senator has pitched himself in recent days as someone who can build a ""broad coalition"" of diverse voters similar to that which first carried former President Barack Obama to victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses and, later, that year's general election.

""I'm hoping folks will see that within me, no matter who you are, that I'm the best person in this race to revive your -- what some people call the Obama coalition -- but I'm talking about a bolder, broader coalition,"" he told reporters in Iowa earlier this week, referring to his desire to ensure the Democratic nominee draws support from a diverse range of voters.

With his campaign headed toward a critical juncture, Stephanopoulos asked Booker if he could ""go all in on Iowa"" when serving as a juror in the president’s impeachment trial could make that strategy ""almost impossible.""

Booker acknowledged that he may be pulled off the trail should the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump lead to a Senate trial, but noted that he takes his Senate oath ""very seriously.""
""I'm going to be in the Senate and do my job"" and ""trust"" that we will ""continue to build on this momentum"" in Iowa..@GStephanopoulos: Can you go all in on Iowa? Will serving as a juror in Trump's trial make that strategy almost impossible?Cory Booker: ""I'm going to be in the Senate and do my job"" and ""trust"" that we will ""continue to build on this momentum"" in Iowa. https://t.co/mFDcD5iy9O pic.twitter.com/mIQd0fATkq— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 8, 2019 .@GStephanopoulos: Can you go all in on Iowa?

​The senator was additionally critical of Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the backchannels by which Giuliani has participated in U.S. foreign policy. Giuliani was in Ukraine this past week meeting with current and former Ukrainian officials as part of a documentary series by far-right network One America News Network.
On Sunday, Booker further denounced Giuliani because he has yet to publicly testify on his actions.

""What's going on right now is just unacceptable to anybody who's going to be a fair observer of fact,"" Booker told Stephanopoulos. ""And the fact that we can't get to the truth of this matter is Giuliani is not willing to testify and the president of the United States is holding back witnesses that could give the American people insights into the true breadth and depth of this corruption is just -- should be frustrating to everyone."""
Impeachment articles 'very strong': Pelosi,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-trump-impeachment-articles-theyre-strong/story?id=67685149,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump ""very strong"" even as he and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee argued that they allege no specific crime, such as bribery, was committed.

""The articles are what they are. They’re very powerful. They’re very strong,"" Pelosi said as the Judiciary Committee was debating the wording of the articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

The debate came ahead of an expected final vote Thursday to send them to the House for final votes next week.

Asked why no specific crime such as bribery was included -- a charge Pelosi herself has leveled against the president -- she answered, ""I, myself, am not a lawyer, although sometimes I act like one,"" saying that she had left the matter up to the committee chairs and legal counsel.

""The president is wrong,"" Pelosi said flatly, responding to his calling this ""impeachment lite.""
""Nothing swift about it, but it is urgent,"" Pelosi said, about the speed of the Democrats' impeachment effort, saying six committees have been working on the impeachment investigation ""for a long time.""

Democrats argue Trump poses a ""clear and present danger"" to American democracy because, unless he's stopped, they say, he might try to ""cheat"" again in next November's election.

Asked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce what message she had for moderate Democrats worried a vote for impeachment might hurt them politically, Pelosi said she would not try to persuade them -- including ones elected in districts that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I have no message to them. We are not whipping this legislation,"" she said, ""nor do we ever whip something like this. People have to come to their own conclusions.""""I have no message to them ... people have to come to their own conclusions,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells ABC News' @marykbruce when asked what her message is to moderate Democrats who are concerned that a vote for impeachment could hurt them politically. https://t.co/l8K4Z1nnsy pic.twitter.com/MUh9Wt08oq— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 12, 2019

""They’ve seen the facts as presented in the Intelligence Committee – they’ve seen the Constitution, they know it – they take an oath to protect and defend it.  But they see the constitutional experts speak about it.  They’ll make their own decisions.  I don’t say anything to them,"" she said.

""The facts are irrefutable,"" she said. ""The fact is we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy used his weekly press conference to rail against Democrats, saying they’ve been determined to impeach Trump since he took office.

He said if Republicans were in the majority, they would “not use our power simply for the sake of dislike of another individual.”

He added that the impeachment process has “weakened the office of the president” and the idea of democracy.

“I wish they would take one pause and think as an American, what does it do to the country?” he said.

On the upcoming Senate trial, McCarthy said he is not concerned.

“If it goes over to the Senate I don’t think it should have to last that long because there are no facts there to uphold impeachment,” he said.

“The articles they have, I don’t think stand on any merit,” he said.

Impeachment report details 'scheme' by Trump to pressure Ukraine for his benefit,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-report-details-scheme-trump-pressure-ukraine-benefit/story?id=67467779,"
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Tuesday released a sweeping new report on behalf of Democrats that lays out their case for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, calling it a “wrenching time for the nation” but insisting that nothing less than American democracy is at stake.

At a news conference shortly afterward Schiff said, ""The president ... was willing to sacrifice the national security of the United States ... in order to get what he wanted.""

Asking rhetorically ""What does this means for Americans? Why should they care?"" Schiff said, ""This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security,"" adding, ""Americans should care deeply about whether the president of the United States is betraying their trust in him.""

""We should care about this. We must care about this,"" Schiff said, arguing that if not, Trump would be ""back at it again.""
The report, which can be read here, directly accuses the president of a “scheme” that leveraged his power in office for his own personal and political gain. Democrats allege there is enough evidence from witness testimony and documents to find that Trump conditioned a White House meeting, as well as nearly $400 million in military aid, on Ukraine’s willingness to launch an investigation that included Trump’s 2020 political rival Joe Biden.

The 300-page report also accuses the president of obstructing the impeachment inquiry by telling witnesses to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. Several of those witnesses defied those demands and testified anyway.
“The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation’s upcoming presidential election to his advantage,” Schiff, D-Calif., states in a preface to the report. “In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.”

Schiff said the president and his supporters have attacked “the very idea of fact and truth.”

“America remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world … What we do will determine what they see, and whether America remains a nation committed to the rule of law,” he wrote.

While the report makes no explicit recommendation for possible articles of impeachment, it offers a detailed roadmap that the House Judiciary Committee is expected to use to write them. The report details the president’s actions to leverage Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the help of his close advisers -- specifically naming acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, along with other administration officials.

The report accuses the president of undermining U.S. national security interests and U.S. policy as it relates to Ukraine. It is divided into two sections -- one focused on the substance of the allegations detailing the president’s alleged abuse of power and the second section outlines the obstruction of the impeachment inquiry, focusing on witness intimidation and blocking witness testimony.
The report was released while Trump was attending a NATO summit in London, but the White House was ready with a dismissive response.

""At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump. This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff’s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released their own report Monday evening which refutes many of the findings laid out by the Democrats.

That 123-page GOP report argues that Trump should not be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to “benefit in the 2020 election.”
Republicans will have until Thursday to reply to the report voted on Tuesday with their own remarks that will also be passed along to the House Judiciary Committee.
Once the Judiciary Committee has had time to consider the report and conduct their own hearings, the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday, they’ll determine whether or not to propose articles of impeachment.
A joint statement on that point from Schiff and fellow Democrats -- Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney-- read: “It will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offense, whether the President shall be held to account, and whether we as a nation are committed to the rule of law—or, instead, whether a president who uses the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a U.S. election is something that Americans must simply ‘get over.’

“With the release of our report, the American people can review for themselves the evidence detailing President Trump’s betrayal of the public trust.”

A whistleblower report which alleged that Trump had dangled a White House meeting and military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukrainian officials opening an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy launched the House impeachment investigation earlier this year.

It’s been almost nine weeks since members of the House Intelligence Committee began hearing from witnesses as part of the impeachment investigation.
The committee publicly interviewed 12 officials over the two weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving recess. Those hearings followed almost six weeks of closed door depositions with 17 individuals.

During both public and closed door hearings, officials interviewed consistently testified that they believed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy was contingent upon Zelenskiy making an announcement of plans to investigate Biden.

This is a claim that Trump and other White House officials have denied.

House Democrats condemn DeVos' handling of loan forgiveness program,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-condemn-education-secretary-betsy-devos-handling/story?id=67686388,"
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday as she appeared before the House Education and Labor committee to defend her handling of a student debt relief policy.

The policy, called ""Borrower’s Defense,"" is designed to offer debt relief to students who claim to have been defrauded by certain for-profit institutions.

DeVos argues that not all claims should be approved, stating in her written testimony that, ""if claims are false, or students did not suffer financial harm, then hardworking taxpayers should not pay their student loans for them. It’s a matter of fairness.""
Chairman Bobby Scott, D-Va., in his opening statement, said DeVos’ ""refusal to process claims is inflicting serious harm on the students you have a duty serve.""

""While the Department has been searching for a legal method of shortchanging defrauded borrowers, those defrauded borrowers have been left with mountains of debt, worthless degrees, and none of the job opportunities they were promised,"" Scott's opening statement said.
He added, ""In many cases, they have been unable to go back to school, start a family, and move on with their lives.""

Scott also accused the Education Department of ""illegally"" collecting on ""45,000 borrowers who are waiting for you to take action on their claims.""

""In some cases, these individuals had their wages and tax returns garnished by the very government that was supposed to be providing them relief,"" Scott said.

Republicans, however, defended DeVos and the department’s management of the claims.

""Claims that Secretary DeVos is unnecessarily or purposely delaying relief for these borrowers is false,"" Ranking member Virginia Foxx of North Carolina said in her opening statement.

""Secretary DeVos is putting reforms in place that will help defrauded students navigate the process of getting the loan relief they deserve,"" she said. ""And Committee Republicans are supportive of these efforts. Defrauded students who have been financially harmed should get relief.""
But the Republican defense didn’t stop Democrats from aggressively going after DeVos and her leadership at the department.
At one point during the hearing, Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida asked DeVos, ""Why has every decision you’ve made harmed students instead of empowering them?""

Wilson said that although in the past she has often disagreed with her Republican counterparts over their approach to education, she has ""never, not one time, believed they were out to destroy public education, until I met you,"" speaking to the secretary.

Wilson continued to condemn DeVos' leadership, ""You are the most unpopular person in our government, millions will register to vote in 2020, many will vote to remove you, more than to remove the president.""

Following Wilson’s remarks, Foxx said the claim that DeVos is trying to ""destroy public education"" was ""going too far.""

""That kind of comment cannot stand in this committee,"" Foxx said.

In her written testimony, DeVos said that she agreed that there is a backlog of claims at Federal Student Aid.

""To say that I am frustrated by that backlog is an understatement,"" she said in her written testimony. ""But rather than focus on why there is a backlog, too many have instead focused on creating a media circus.""

The Note: Biden back in center of Democratic race,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-biden-back-center-democratic-race/story?id=67672552,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

If you’re looking for a new front-runner in the Democratic race, you could do worse than the old front-runner. Just don’t call him old.

A confluence of forces have vaulted former Vice President Joe Biden back to a solid position as the national front-runner in a range of polls released Wednesday, along with strong standing in the Super Tuesday giants of California and Texas.
President Donald Trump has made him the main focus of his attacks even as impeachment draws closer. Biden is also the potential beneficiary of recent scrutiny on Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- as well as Sen. Kamala Harris’ exit from the race, since that eliminated a potential major rival in South Carolina.

And Biden’s standing wasn’t shaken by the late entries of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Gov. Deval Patrick. Both candidacies were viewed as statements on Biden’s viability, or lack thereof.

One-term pledge or not -- and the answer is a definitive no, at least for now -- the concept that it would stabilize the country is a potentially powerful one for Biden.

His campaign wants to project steadiness. His poll numbers are nothing if not steady.

The RUNDOWN with Kendall Karson

Michael Bloomberg's attempts to define himself as a pragmatic alternative to the rest of the Democratic field are often thwarted by the heightened scrutiny that comes with becoming a presidential candidate, as he first has to dance around questions about his past, particularly his longstanding support for ""stop-and-frisk"" policing.

""We tried a lot of things; my whole focus was on reducing the murder rate, in looking back and certainly in the third term, I think it got out of hand,"" he conceded on Wednesday during a stop in California, one of the 16 Super Tuesday states and territories he is betting his presidency on. ""Maybe I should have paid more attention, but it got out of hand when we realized that it was too much. ... And then I said, 'Look I made a mistake,' and apologized for it.""
As Bloomberg referenced his rare apology -- which came a week before he announced a bid for the nation's highest office and was a stunning reversal for the former mayor who vigorously defended the policy throughout his tenure -- he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs, a young African American and rising Democratic star, who stepped in to defend the presidential contender as he was peppered with questions from reporters about ""stop and frisk.”

""I think a leader is one who apologizes,"" Tubbs said, after Bloomberg scored his endorsement.

But even when he drops $10 million for vulnerable House Democrats to help them compete against a slew of GOP-backed anti-impeachment ads, shifting the focus off himself, Bloomberg is still being dogged by the ghosts of his mayoral past. It appears his unconventional pursuit of the party’s presidential nomination is left more reliant on his massive $100 million TV ad buy -- where he gets up to 60 seconds of unfettered time to frame his candidacy.

The TIP with Chris Donato and Averi Harper

Two members of the so-called ""squad,” Reps. Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley will be hitting the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Friday trying to sway young voters for two candidates over 70.

The progressive congresswomen of color are lending their political capital to support progressive 2020 hopefuls.

Omar has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders while Pressley has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and is a co-chair for Warren’s campaign.
Omar will attend a town hall with Sanders in Manchester and cohost a rally in Nashua.

They’ll both bring their sway to young Democrats on Friday. Pressley will speak on behalf of Warren at the New Hampshire Young Democrats Granite Slate Awards. Omar will join Sanders when he, too, speaks at the awards in Manchester.

It’s the first trip to the Granite State for both members of the squad, a group that includes Sanders-endorser Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well. Pressley’s visit comes as Warren has seen a dip in the polls; in a Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week, Warren received 15% from voters, down from 28% on October.

Gearing up for an impeachment trial in the Senate, President Donald Trump and his top advisers are considering expanding his legal team and bringing on controversial attorney and professor Alan Dershowitz, multiple sources told ABC News. Dershowitz attended an event Wednesday at the White House and was asked to speak briefly by the president ahead of signing an executive order on anti-Semitism.

AP FACT CHECK: Trump and the people he forgets he knew,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-fact-check-trump-people-forgets-knew-67565249,"
When certain associates and acquaintances of President Donald Trump get into hot water, he forgets he ever knew them. Various figures from the Russia investigation and the Ukraine matter as well as a British prince have fallen out of familiarity with the president in this way.
For a few days, the stock market suffered a similar fate when it dipped  too low for Trump to boast about it. But he  rediscovered the market by the end of the week when it rose back up.
A look at some remarks by Trump from the NATO summit in London and from back home as the Democratic effort to impeach him moves ahead:
PRINCE ANDREW
TRUMP: “I don’t know Prince Andrew. ... I don’t know him."" — remarks Tuesday with NATO Secretary-General  Jens Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: Trump knows the British prince. Andrew hosted a breakfast for him in June, they toured Westminster Abbey together and photos spread over two decades capture some occasions when they've met. The prince stepped back from royal duties after his involvement with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was exposed.
Trump also recently declared, repeatedly, that he did not know Gordon Sondland, his ambassador to the EU, “very well” and “I have not spoken to him much.” Sondland provided some of the most damning testimony in the House impeachment inquiry about how he had tried to carry out Trump's wishes to persuade Ukraine to investigate the president's political rivals in the U.S.
Sondland testified that he's had many conversations with Trump, who called the ambassador “a really good man and great American” before Sondland's problematic testimony.
Several people in prominent positions in the Trump campaign or known as close advisers were similarly marginalized — as mere volunteers, hangers-on or low-level functionaries — when it became troublesome during the Russia investigation to acknowledge their stature.
———
STOCK MARKET
TRUMP: “If the stock market goes up or down — I don’t watch the stock market. I watch jobs."" — remarks Tuesday during NATO summit after stocks fell sharply.
THE FACTS: This is not true. Trump watches the stock market, as he demonstrated Friday when the market rebounded and he tweeted precise percentages of how much the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have gone up this year. “Stock Markets Up Record Numbers,” he tweeted.
Trump uses the stock market as a leading barometer of his presidency, giving the subject a rest only when the market's performance is down. 
It's an almost constant companion, through thick but not thin. 
On a good day, he will tweet about it. Otherwise, his rally speeches and White House remarks are laced with references to the market's growth since he became president. He takes credit for gains and blames losses on other things, like Democrats.
Trump tweeted about the stock market more than a dozen times in November as it repeatedly edged into record highs.
On one occasion, his boastfulness became too much even for him. He tweeted: “Stock Markets (all three) hit another ALL TIME & HISTORIC HIGH yesterday! You are sooo lucky to have me as your President."" Then he added: ""(just kidding!).”
———
MACRON
TRUMP, on French President Emmanuel Macron's assertion that NATO is suffering “brain death”: “He’s taken back his comments very much so on NATO."" — remarks Wednesday in London.
THE FACTS: No, Macron did not back off what Trump had called a “very, very nasty” statement about NATO. He conspicuously stood by it, before the summit, after it and when face to face with Trump in a tense joint news conference. If anything, Macron appeared to relish the provocation he had brought on.
“I do stand by it,” he said Tuesday as Trump looked on. “I assume full responsibility for it,” he said Wednesday. And Macron tweeted: “The comments I made about NATO prompted a debate among members of the alliance. This dialogue is a very good thing.” He likened himself to an ice-breaker smashing through ice.
Macron characterized NATO as brain dead last month, citing a lack of U.S. leadership and confusion in the alliance about what its fundamental missions should be. He said the U.S. was turning its back on NATO and — in light of Trump's unexpected announcement in October that he would withdraw troops from Syria — not coordinating with allies on strategic decision-making.
On Wednesday, Macron mildly praised the summit as “constructive” while emphasizing that the fundamentals that sparked his complaint had not been resolved.
———
OCEAN DEBRIS
TRUMP: ""I also see what’s happening with our oceans, where certain countries are dumping unlimited loads of things in it. They float — they tend to float toward the United States. I see that happening, and nobody has ever seen anything like it, and it’s gotten worse.""' — remarks Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say, when making this repeated complaint, is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores.
Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, “but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia.” In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin.
The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said.
“Most debris we find on the coast of the US is likely from the US,” Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia’s federal science organization, said by email.
Hardesty surveyed the U.S. West Coast from Washington to the California border with Mexico and found the dirtiest place was in Long Beach at the river mouth, where researchers found 4,500 items.
Marcus Eriksen, chief science officer and co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, which fights plastics pollution, said Asian fishing gear arrives as debris in Alaska and British Columbia because of north Pacific currents, a problem exacerbated by the lack of regulation of such gear. But in pointing the finger at Asia, Trump is ignoring “our own problems with plastic waste here at home.""
———
IMPEACHMENT
TRUMP: “The word ‘impeachment’ is a dirty word, and it's a word that was only supposed to be used in special occasions: high crimes and misdemeanors. In this case, there was no crime whatsoever. Not even a little tiny crime. There was no crime whatsoever, and they know it. ” — remarks Wednesday with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
THE FACTS: That's a misrepresentation of the conditions for impeaching a president. The         constitutional grounds for impeachment do not require any crime to have been committed. In setting the conditions, treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors, the Founding Fathers said that a consequential abuse of office — crime or not — was subject to the impeachment process they laid out.
Months after the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Alexander Hamilton         explained in the Federalist Papers that a commonly understood crime need not be the basis of impeachment. Offenses qualifying for that step “are of a nature ... POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself,"" he wrote.
As they move toward drafting articles of impeachment, though, Democrats are alleging crimes involving obstruction of justice as part of their case that Trump abused his office.
———
TRUMP, on his July 25 call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy: “All you have to do is listen to the call or read the call. We had it transcribed perfectly. But he was — he said — no pressure, no nothing. There was no nothing.” — remarks Wednesday with Conte.
TRUMP: “Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls ... case over!” — tweet Monday.
THE FACTS: Trump misleads in suggesting that Zelenskiy didn’t have any concerns about the call. Nor was the call “transcribed perfectly;"" only a rough transcript was released by the White House.
While Zelenskiy initially said there was no discussion of a quid pro quo, he said in an interview Monday with Time that Trump should not have blocked military aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy also criticized Trump for casting the country as corrupt, saying it sends a concerning message to international allies.
On that call discussing military aid, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Trump’s political rivals in the U.S.
“Look I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,” Zelenskiy said. “But you have to understand. We’re at war. If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness.""
On corruption, Zelenskiy said it unfairly undermines support for the country.
“Everyone hears that signal,” he said. “Investments, banks, stakeholders, companies, American, European, companies that have international capital in Ukraine, it’s a signal to them that says, ‘Be careful, don’t invest.’ Or, ‘Get out of there.’”
It’s true that in early October, Zelenskiy had told reporters “there was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.” But he did not state Trump had done “nothing” wrong, even as he let his criticisms simmer before surfacing them.
In any event, Zelenskiy         knew months before the call that much-needed U.S. military support might depend on whether he was willing to help Trump by investigating Democrats.
———
TRUMP: “For the hearings, we don’t get a lawyer.” — remarks Tuesday with Trudeau.
THE FACTS: Trump is wrong about being deprived of an attorney in the House Judiciary Committee hearings. The committee invited Trump and his lawyers to appear if he wishes, but the White House refused.
In a letter early in the week to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined the invitation for the president’s counsel to appear at Wednesday's hearing while Trump was at the NATO summit, insisting that the inquiry violates “basic due process rights.”
For hearings in the coming week, Trump had until Friday to decide whether he would take advantage of due process protections afforded to him under House rules adopted in October. He was offered an opportunity to ask for witness testimony and to cross-examine the witnesses called by the House. But he decided not to participate in that round, too. 
If the House impeaches Trump, the Senate trial will look like a normal trial in some respects, with senators as the jury. Arguments would be heard from each side’s legal team for and against Trump’s removal from office.
The Intelligence Committee hearings, in contrast, were like the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the person under investigation.
———
RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chairwoman, on Democrats who said the Russia investigation should be part of the basis for impeaching Trump, not just his actions with Ukraine: ""Are you kidding me? They lied for 2 years about collusion & POTUS was exonerated."" — tweet Thursday, using POTUS as an abbreviation of president of the U.S.
THE FACTS: She's wrong to suggest that special counsel Robert Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. 
Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office.
Mueller's         two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Clinton. 
On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. 
He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. 
Mueller noted some Trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the Fifth Amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony, making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign. The special counsel wrote that he ""cannot rule out the possibility"" that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation's findings. 
Mueller also did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice or broke any other law. 
He said his team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge Trump, partly because of a Justice Department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn't be indicted.
———
TRADE
TRUMP: “We won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations.” — remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.
The U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. won 91% of the cases it took to the Geneva-based trade monitor. 
As Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case.
As for Trump's claim that the U.S. “won” $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right.
Trump was referring to a WTO decision         in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion.
The WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus — a fight that began long before Trump was in office.
———
ISLAMIC STATE
TRUMP: “We have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe.” — remarks Tuesday with Macron.
MACRON: There are “very large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region.” Those from Europe are ""a tiny minority of the overall problem.""
THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. 
Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.
European nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims.
———
TRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: “We have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want."" — remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: That’s not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can’t do anything it wants with it.
As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat IS. “Maybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,” McGurk         told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil.
While Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he’s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any IS resurgence.
The Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to ""reinforce"" control of the oil fields and prevent them from “falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors.”
———
BRITAIN'S HEALTH CARE
TRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: “I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.” — remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a “rumor.”
Asked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said “when you're dealing in trade, everything’s on the table. So, NHS or anything else.""
The service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services companies can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. 
As well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharmaceutical companies more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs.
Leaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 — released by the Labour Party last week — said “patent issues” around “NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration” in talks.
It’s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be “selling off” the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill.
But it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would “want nothing to do"" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump’s words.

Buttigieg calls on McKinsey to release information about his consulting work,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/buttigieg-calls-mckinsey-release-information-consulting-work-middle/story?id=67550464,"
Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has called on his former employer, McKinsey and Co., to release information about his time working for the consulting firm in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Buttigieg has said he's personally unable to discuss what he did because of a non-disclosure agreement he signed with McKinsey he left the firm in 2010.

""I give authorization to McKinsey to release the full list of clients I was assigned to serve,"" Buttigieg said Friday night in a statement that included a summery of his work at the firm.

As ABC News previously reported, from 2007 to 2010, Buttigieg was working in the Middle East on behalf of McKinsey. But Buttigieg has said relatively little about his time in the region.

While with McKinsey, Buttigieg said that in 2007 he served a nonprofit health insurance provider for three months in Michigan, and in 2008 he worked in the Toronto area analyzing prices for a grocery and retail chain for about six months. In 2008 and 2009 he worked mostly in Connecticut on research to fight climate change by improving energy efficiency, and in 2009 he worked in California for an environmental nonprofit. In 2009, he also worked in Washington, with trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, for the U.S. government.
In Buttigieg's book, ""The Shortest Way Home,"" he scarcely mentions his consulting but does drop hints about his work in ""war zone economic development to help grow private sector employment."" He also refers to a ""safe house"" in Baghdad.

His final project for McKinsey was from 2009 to 2010. He analyzed logistics for a shipping provider.

The South Bend mayor's civilian work for the famously secretive consulting company -- and his silence on the matter -- has faced increased scrutiny as his popularity grows among the pool of 2020 Democratic primary contenders.

Asked by ABC News' Whit Johnson on Friday whether Buttigieg believes the American people should know about his work for McKinsey, Buttigieg said he believes it is important for this information to be released, and that he was urging McKinsey to release him from his non-disclosure agreement.
""I don't think that McKinsey should force me to choose between keeping my word in a legal document that I signed din good faith and the need for the American people to know,"" Buttigieg told Johnson. ""They can fix this by releasing it and getting that information out there.

On Friday morning, Buttigieg also addressed the issue in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio.

""Right now I am calling on McKinsey to release that information,"" Buttigieg said. ""Maybe they're not used to doing that, but they're not used to having somebody who used to work there being seriously considered for the American presidency. This information should come out and I'm happy to speak to it when it does.""

Reached by ABC News on Friday, a spokesperson for McKinsey declined to comment on Buttigieg's request to be released from his NDA.

Buttigieg continued to emphasize his calls for McKinsey to release him from his non-disclosure agreement at campaign events throughout the day.
""I believe in keeping your word,"" Buttigieg said Friday at a campaign event at a house party in Concord, New Hampshire. ""And I signed a legal document about client names and I am calling on McKinsey to release me from that.""

Buttigieg's comments came shortly after the Thursday publication of a New York Times editorial that called on the mayor to tell voters about his time abroad with McKinsey.

""Mr. Buttigieg owes voters a more complete accounts of his time at the company,"" the Times editorial board wrote. ""Voters seeking an alternative to Mr. Trump should demand that candidates not only reject Mr. Trump's positions, but also his behavior -- including his refusal to share information about his health and his business dealings.""
In Friday's statement, Buttigieg said his campaign first reached out in June about the scope of the agreement and have reached out additional times since.

""To date,"" the statement read, ""the company has not agreed."""
The Note: Trumpian defenses fail another Trump ally,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-trumpian-defenses-fail-trump-ally/story?id=67446644,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

He called it a ""witch hunt"" and a partisan attack waged by the Justice Department. Now, Rep. Duncan Hunter said he will change his plea to guilty on Tuesday in a federal campaign-finance case.

Hunter was the second House member to endorse candidate Donald Trump in 2016. He will now join the first to do so, former Rep. Chris Collins, in pleading guilty to a felony charge after initially claiming he was being prosecuted out of political malice.

It's the latest example of the limits of a defense of denial and deflection in the face of actual evidence. Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and others in and around the Trump orbit got similar lessons.
Now, with impeachment moving forward with an initial House Intelligence Committee vote on Tuesday, the bigger question is whether similar limits apply to someone who also has the powers of the presidency.

Republican House members from the Intelligence Committee are out with a pre-buttal, arguing that Democrats are relying on ""hearsay, presumption and emotion"" as a ""tool for settling political scores."" They're choosing not to contest the basic facts.

Impeachment, of course, is more a political process than it is a legal one. That distinction has kept the Democrats' push on a steady track -- and is helping keep Republicans in line.

The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks

President Donald Trump's trip abroad to London this week to meet with NATO leaders serves as poignant reminder to American voters that there is a long list of urgent policy matters facing the international community, including terrorism, refugee crises and the threat of Russian aggression beyond its borders.

A bipartisan group of senators on Monday called for new sanctions against one key ally in the alliance.

Sens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking him to consider sanctions on Turkey, following reports that the country is testing components of a Russian air missile system – the latest evidence that Russia's efforts to cozy up to the NATO partner are working.

Coordinated, collective defense and strategic communication between the allies in NATO is one of the perks of membership.
But Pentagon officials have said the Russian air system Turkey is testing poses a threat to NATO systems, because Russia could use its system to pinpoint the American F-35s capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.

Meanwhile, Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi is countering the president's foreign trip with one of her own.

To both represent the U.S. and serve as a foil to the current White House, she is leading a large congressional delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, as the Trump administration continues to distance itself from most global efforts on the topic.

The TIP with Cheyenne Haslett

Just over 60 days away from the Iowa caucuses, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has found herself slipping in the polls and running in a race that continues to shift around her.

And though Warren maintains that she doesn't ""do"" polls, nor does she plan to change in response to them, her recent swing through Iowa showed a glimpse of deviation in a campaign that's been set in its ways for nearly 11 months.
Shortening her stump speech and taking a dozen questions from the crowd, the different style -- however slight -- offered an air of unpredictability and, at times, tearful, candid moments. So is the candidate switching things up to regain enthusiasm?

""No,"" Warren told ABC News on Monday night. ""This is a chance to just talk to more people and hear their questions and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning, in Iowa.""

Expect the more voter-centered style to continue on the trail, especially in small towns or cities across Iowa where Warren has spoken multiple times before -- and where personal connections are the way to victory.

ONE MORE THING

A new report by House Republicans, reviewed by ABC News on Monday, argues that President Donald Trump shouldn't be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to ""benefit in the 2020 election."" The 123-page report is the official GOP response after several weeks of closed-door and public testimony that detailed Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to announce an investigation that included Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

What matters this morning with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos: Trump and impeachment,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matters-morning-abc-news-george-stephanopoulos-stories/story?id=66920901,"
It's Friday Dec. 6, 2019. Here are the biggest stories I'm following this morning. I’ll be breaking it all down with our team starting at 7 a.m. EST, on ""Good Morning America.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she has instructed House Democrats to draw up articles of impeachment of President Donald Trump, saying he had abused his power. While Democrats are still divided over the nature and scope of possible charges against Trump, House Judiciary Committee Democrats suggested they could pursue articles on abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress.

On Monday, attorneys with the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee will present evidence for impeachment before Judiciary Committee members, suggesting that elements of the Ukraine and Mueller investigations will be taken into account in the drafting of articles of impeachment.Lots to watch this Fri: Speaker Pelosi announcing House advancing, drafting impeachment articles. Deadline today: will Pres participate in hearings? Biden’s encounter w/ voter in Iowa. Plus a court hearing that may determine release of more StateDept docs related to Ukraine. @GMA pic.twitter.com/Y5r6QITTi0— GeorgeStephanopoulos (@GStephanopoulos) December 6, 2019

Lots to watch this Fri: Speaker Pelosi announcing House advancing, drafting impeachment articles. Deadline today: will Pres participate in hearings? Biden’s encounter w/ voter in Iowa. Plus a court hearing that may determine release of more StateDept docs related to Ukraine. @GMA pic.twitter.com/Y5r6QITTi0
My take: There’s no turning back now for the House after that dramatic announcement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday saying that the president has left them no choice but to go forward on impeachment. It sure looks like they’re on track for a vote by Christmas.

But today is a big day. There’s this 5 p.m. deadline for President Trump to decide whether he’s going to participate in this next round of hearings at the Judiciary Committee. That could affect both the schedule and the tenor of those hearings.

The other big question in play right now is how broad is the House going to go on these articles of impeachment? Are they going to reach in, or reach back, to the Mueller report and the evidence he laid out of obstruction of justice? That certainly is in play for Monday’s hearing.

One other thing to keep your eye on. An important court hearing in Washington could determine whether more State Department documents about Ukraine come out before Christmas. We’re going to keep an eye on that too.

Joe Biden confronted a man at a town hall in New Hampton, Iowa, calling him ""a damn liar"" after he pressed the former vice president on his son's business ties to Ukraine.

""You're a damn liar, man. That's not true. No one has ever said that,"" a heated Biden responded. ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong, and I did not on any occasion, and nobody has ever said it.""

Biden also challenged the man -- who also said Biden was too old to be president -- to do push-ups and take an IQ test with him to prove his physical and mental fitness to be president.

My take: My question for all of you is how did it play to you? Did it look like he was out of control, or was this a case of him standing up for himself that will actually help him with voters?

Staffer who allegedly posted vulgar tweets no longer with Sanders' campaign,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/staffer-allegedly-posted-vulgar-tweets-longer-sanders-campaign/story?id=67556656,"
A recent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign hire is no longer with the campaign after a series of vulgar tweets allegedly posted by the staffer nearly a decade ago surfaced on his Twitter account, according to the campaign.
The tweets, which contain anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic and racist language were originally reported by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative-leaning news outlet. The staffer, who was hired as the campaign’s deputy director of constituency organizing, allegedly posted the tweets in 2010, 2011 and 2012 according to the publication.
The Free Beacon report included screenshots of the tweets. The staffer's Twitter account has since been deleted.

When asked for comment, Sanders’ Communications Director Mike Casca said, “He’s no longer with the campaign and we wish him the best.”
Attempts by ABC News to reach the staffer were unsuccessful.

The Note: Speed defines Democrats’ impeachment push,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-speed-defines-democrats-impeachment-push/story?id=67497565,"
The TAKE with Rick Klein

If President Donald Trump's actions constitute a ""clear and present danger,"" as the House Intelligence Committee report asserts, House Democrats are pursuing a timeline that reflects that urgency.

That may be one reason for the speed that's defining Democrats' push for impeachment, with all signs continuing to point to a pre-Christmas vote on the House floor. But other reasons for quick action are coming into view -- with broader lessons for this moment in politics.

Among the most effective argument deployed by the GOP's impeachment expert, professor Jonathan Turley, was his counsel for Democrats to slow down.

""If you rush this impeachment, you are going to leave half the country behind,"" Turley warned.
Yet Democratic leaders don't want to chase ghosts when it comes to potential testimony from administration officials who may not have much to add anyway. They also don't want to clutter their arguments with any number of other potential items, from ground covered by Robert Mueller to issues raised by the emoluments clause.

Perhaps most relevantly, while House Democrats are largely convinced that they are on the right side of history, they are increasingly coming to the opinion that the public is unlikely to join them there in sufficient numbers any time soon.

""Opinion on impeachment seems to have hardened as a result of the public testimony instead of persuading people to change their position,"" FiveThirtyEight's analysis of recent polling finds.

To build on Turley's argument, this means that if half the country is being left behind, Democrats' working theory is that they want to stay there. That serves as its own warning as we enter a presidential-election year where the candidates would rather be talking about other things anyway.

The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks

The legal scholars testifying on Wednesday were tasked with putting the allegations against Trump into historical context -- around the framing and intention of the Constitution as well as in direct comparison to the past impeachment proceedings of other presidents.

President Richard Nixon was mentioned by name more than four dozen times over the course of the day.
At the start of his opening remarks, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler accused this White House of unprecedented obstruction.

""No other president has vowed to, 'fight all of the subpoenas,' as President Trump promised,"" he said. ""In the 1974 impeachment proceedings, President Nixon produced dozens of recordings. In 1998, President Clinton physically gave his blood.""

The past articles of impeachment laid against Nixon included allegations of obstruction of justice as Nixon, like Trump, fought legislative subpoenas tooth and nail. For Democrats, the failure of the White House to participate in the process is a sign that he thinks he is above the law. The Republican witness, Turley, pointed out that there are three branches of government, not two and that Nixon lost in the courts, as Trump has of late.

One of the Democratic witnesses, University of North Carolina professor Michael Gerhardt, used a Nixon analogy to argue that the president could have still engaged in wrongdoing even though Ukraine eventually received the congressionally approved aid.

""The fact that President Nixon was not ultimately successful in covering up the break-in was not grounds for not impeaching him. The attempt itself is the impeachable act,"" he said.

Stanford Law School professor Pamela Karlan drew direct comparisons too saying, ""Nixon abused domestic law enforcement to go after his political opponents. And what President Trump has done, based on the evidence that we have seen so far, is he has asked a foreign country to do that. Which means it's sort of like a daily double, if you will, of problems.""
The TIP with Briana Stewart

Fourteen candidates filed to compete in the ""First in the South"" contest in South Carolina and, as anticipated, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg will not be on ballot. He is running an unconventional national campaign, skipping the first four early voting states and focusing on battleground states where he'll have more time to make a case for his White House bid ahead of Super Tuesday.

Trav Robertson, chairman of the state's Democratic Party told ABC News that he understands Bloomberg's strategy, but called his decision not to file a ""missed opportunity""--  not only for the Palmetto state, but for the billionaire's own campaign.  Robertson said Bloomberg's state campaign could have expanded Democratic chances in purple counties, increasing the possibility to win over more moderate Obama-Trump Republicans and independent swing voters. More notably,  South Carolina's primary also functions as a litmus test among minority voters and can propel successful candidates into Super Tuesday, where they compete in a cluster of states that feature a more diverse electorate.

""If you're going to make a play and make a stand, it's cheaper and more cost efficient to do it in South Carolina knowing that if you can't put together a message that communicates with people of color and a diverse electorate like we have in this state, then you're probably not going to be successful on Super Tuesday or in some of the larger states in America,"" Robertson told ABC News.

Sen. Kamala Harris' exit from the race has forced Democrats to have a frank conversation about the depleting diversity in the presidential campaign. Sen. Cory Booker told MSNBC that there are now ""more billionaires than black people in the race,"" calling out Bloomberg and Tom Steyer who are outspending their rivals in political ads without matching their competitors' ground game. Meanwhile, Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang are all struggling to raise funds and meet the Democratic National Committee's qualifications to make the next presidential debate.

Russian nationals indicted in alleged massive hacking and bank fraud scheme,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-nationals-indicted-doj-alleged-massive-hacking-bank/story?id=67518005,"
Two Russian nationals have been indicted on bank fraud and international computer hacking charges over an alleged decade-long scheme that “deployed two of the most dangerous financial malware ever used and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to victims worldwide,"" according to the Department of Justice.

Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev, described by prosecutors as leaders of “one of the most sophisticated transnational cybercrime syndicates in the world,” are accused in the 10-count indictment of deploying a malware system designed to steal personal and financial information, including online bank information, from infected computers.

The FBI on Thursday issued a wanted bulletin for both individuals, and the State Department announced a $5 million award for the arrest of Yakubets specifically. Both are believed to currently reside in Russia, according to FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.
""These two cases demonstrate our commitment to unmasking the perpetrators behind the world's most egregious cyberattacks,"" Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said.

According to the indictment unsealed Thursday, the malware deployed by Yakubets and Turashev infected tens of thousands of computers across North America and Europe, including two banks, a school district, four Pennsylvania companies and a North Carolina firearm manufacturer.

The indictment said the malware was delivered to victims via ""phishing emails,"" which Yakubets and Turashev would draft to appear as if they were coming from legitimate companies and organizations. Once victims would click on a link in the phishing emails, it would infect the computer and allow hackers to ""hijack"" a computer session and pull up a prompt requesting the user's bank account information.
Once the hackers were in possession of the bank credentials, they would use ""money mules"" to funnel the funds into foreign bank accounts. In one case, an employee of a Pennsylvania school district clicked on a graphic in a phishing email sent by Yakubets and Turashev, and the two later attempted to transfer nearly $1 million from the district's bank account to a bank in Ukraine.

The DOJ has connected Yakubets and Turashev to cyberattacks as recently as March of this year, according to the indictment. As a part of its investigation, the U.S. in 2010 transmitted a mutual legal assistance treaty request to Russia, and according to Bowdich, the Russian government was ""helpful to a point.""

Since that exchange, however, there is believed to have been no further communication between the two countries regarding Yakubets and Turashev.

Speaking to reporters at the Justice Department, Bowdich said the case stresses the need for all Americans to practice ""good cyber hygiene,"" such as regularly updating online passwords, implementing two-factor authentication on sensitive accounts, and heightened awareness and suspicion regarding links sent over email.

What matters this morning with George Stephanopoulos: Impeachment moves forward,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matters-morning-abc-news-george-stephanopoulos-stories/story?id=66920901,"
It's Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2019. Here is the biggest story I'm following this morning. I’ll be breaking it all down with our team starting at 7 a.m. EST, on ""Good Morning America.""

The investigation into President Donald Trump enters a historic next phase on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the constitutional grounds for drafting articles of impeachment. The process of drawing up any articles, now becoming increasingly likely, could begin shortly after members question legal and constitutional experts about what the Constitution requires.

Expected to be highly contentious, the hearing comes a day after the House Intelligence Committee, led by Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, published its report on its investigation into alleged misconduct by the president in regards to Ukraine.Next critical phase in the impeachment inquiry starts today in the House Judiciary Committee—will be watching for fireworks among the members on that committee. Breaking it all down today on @GMA ahead of our coverage of the hearing on @ABC later this morning. pic.twitter.com/Kzc3EsRn0o
My take: The next critical phase of the impeachment inquiry starts today in the House Judiciary Committee. Those hearings that are basically going to be to write the charges based on the evidence compiled by the House Intelligence Committee. Sent over to the Judiciary Committee last night, that 320-page report from [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff outlining mostly what we knew about the scheme, Adam Schiff calls it, by the president to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and the Democrats and what he calls “overwhelming evidence” of obstruction.

As well, what was intriguing about the report last night was that new evidence of phone calls they had, including Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, of course who has been indicted as an associate of Rudy Giuliani, and what looks like officials in the OMB [Office of Management and Budget], probably Mick Mulvaney, and the president himself.

One of the big questions is what’s going to happen with that new evidence, also how fiery the scene in the House Judiciary Committee is going to be today. You’ve got a lot of combative members on that committee. It’s still looking like the House is heading towards having this all wrapped up by Christmas but with new evidence coming in, no question there’s a chance that could extend into January.

GOP breaks with candidate over controversial email,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-republicans-break-gop-house-candidate-traitors-hanged/story?id=67497549,"
National Republicans are breaking with a U.S. House recruit, George Buck, who is running in Florida's competitive 13th Congressional District, after he sought donations from supporters by insinuating that several Democrats, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, should be hanged.

In a fundraising email sent last week, the Republican candidate's campaign for the St. Petersburg-area seat, singled out Omar and falsely accused the Somali-born Democrat, elected in last year's midterms, of working for the country of Qatar and asserted she should be punished, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The email also mentions Buck's Democratic rival, incumbent Rep. Charlie Crist, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

""We should hang these traitors where they stand,"" the email reads, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The campaign literature does not explicitly state who he is referring to as alleged traitors, the paper reported.

ABC News has not independently reviewed the campaign literature.
Buck initially told the Tampa Bay Times he did not write the email, even though it included his signature, adding, ""I would never talk like that.""

In a statement to ABC News Wednesday, when asked about the fundraising email and the NRCC's decision, Buck asserted that treason is a crime punishable by death.

""I am a decorated veteran of the 101st Airborne Division. As someone who has taken the oath to defend the Constitution, I take that oath very seriously,"" he said in the statement. ""Anyone who commits treason against the United States should be tried to the full extent of the law.""

""Treason is one of the few crimes the Constitution has as punishable by death,"" he added.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, he also said, ""Any Republican who calls me out for my rhetoric but doesn't call out the Democrats for theirs are hypocrites.""

Buck did not respond when asked by ABC News if he is suggesting Omar or the other Democrats mentioned in his campaign literature committed treason.

Omar's campaign did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., disavowed Buck's email, saying in a statement Wednesday, ""there’s no place for inciting violence in politics.""

""Instead of doubling down on these disgraceful comments, the candidate ought to apologize unequivocally and denounce these unacceptable statements,"" he continued.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm, dropped Buck from its ""Young Guns"" program, the party's recruitment and mentoring program for rising House candidates running in competitive races -- a move that distances the GOP from the controversial candidate who is standing by the email.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made the decision to remove Buck from the program, and NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer, a Minnesota congressman, agreed with the decision, according to a committee spokesperson. Buck was announced as a member of the program on Oct. 30, alongside 23 other Republicans.

Tlaib, one of Omar's key allies, quickly came to her defense, condemning Buck's email in a tweet: ""The fact that those who make these violent threats very publicly without hesitation reaffirms just how much white supremacy has spread within the @NRCC. They are raising money on a call to hang a Black Muslim member of Congress and too many are silent. @IlhanMN.""

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump has frequently ridiculed Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley--four minority congresswomen who have dubbed themselves the ""Squad"" on the campaign trail, drawing criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for his rhetoric.

Ocasio Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib were born in the U.S., and Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee when she was a child, has been living in the country since she was 12 years old and is a U.S. citizen. In the 2018 midterm elections, all four women won a popular vote to claim their seats in Congress.

Trump has particularly targeted Omar calling her ""an America-hating socialist.""

The president threaded a vicious string of verbal attacks against Omar at an October campaign rally in her home district, calling out her positions on Israel, which elicited scattered ""send her back"" chants from the crowd.

""She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months,"" he continued.
Buck isn't the only congressional candidate to take aim at Omar.

Twitter suspended the account of Danielle Stella, Omar's Republican opponent in the 5th Congressional District race, after she falsely suggested the congresswoman may have passed intel to Iran and should be ""tried for treason and hanged,"" according to the New York Times referencing a screenshot of a tweet sent from her account.

ABC News did not review the original tweet, which can no longer be accessed.

Omar previously denied the allegations made against her according to The Jerusalem Post. Her office told the New York Times that such stories are “outlandishly absurd.”

House Dems combat anti-impeachment attacks,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-elevate-prescription-drug-bill-combat-gop/story?id=67690066,"
The House's moderate freshman Democrats, seen as some of the party's most politically vulnerable members, scored a legislative victory on health care Thursday, solidifying their argument that they can execute legislative priorities while also undercutting Republican claims that impeaching President Donald Trump thwarts progress for the country.

In between the hours of debate inside the House Judiciary Committee's markup of the impeachment articles, House Democrats passed a big-ticket piece of legislation, H.R. 3, aimed at reducing the price of prescription drugs. The vote, which was the culmination of a months-long effort to rally the caucus behind a single approach to lower drug prices, will do so by negotiating costs through Medicare and its vast bargaining power.

With centrist-minded Democrats wary of the political backlash of impeachment, the move bolsters their argument that they can still focus on and advance a comprehensive legislative agenda while simultaneously holding the president accountable for what they argue is an abuse of power. But the bill, not supported by Trump, is likely dead on arrival in the Senate.
The latest legislative accomplishment comes after a bruising few weeks for vulnerable Democrats, who have found themselves at the center of anti-impeachment attacks, including a $2.2 million anti-impeachment ad buy from the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action targeting 27 Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016.

Republicans are pouring millions into television and digital ads to capitalize on the Democrats' impeachment push. As ABC News has previously reported, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee launched a $10 million anti-impeachment ad blitz in September, with $2 million from the RNC targeting more than 60 vulnerable House Democrats in Trump-won or key congressional districts. Last month, conservative nonprofit American Action Network also launched a $7 million TV and digital ad campaign opposing the impeachment, including $5 million in TV ads across 20 congressional districts.
The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm, has also spent $90,000 so far on digital ads targeting Democrats for not ""getting anything accomplished.""

""Socialist Democrats' obsession with unilaterally removing Trump from office comes at the expense of getting anything accomplished for the American people and it will cost them their majority next November,"" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Chris Pack said in a statement to ABC News.

But now national Democrats are closing ranks around their vulnerable members by highlighting their policy bonafides to run counter to Republicans' massive impeachment offensive.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a new digital ad campaign, their opening salvo for 2020 backed by a mid-five figure buy, across the House battleground's swing districts.

""This targeted ad buy is a reminder that while House Democrats continue to put the priorities of the American people first, Washington Republicans once again showed they will always prioritize padding the pockets of their special interest backers over the people they were elected to represent,"" said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos.
The digital ads on Facebook will target voters across the congressional battlefield, which includes the DCCC's front-line members, the party's most vulnerable candidates up for reelection, and their top GOP targets. The ads, which underscore the efforts by House Democrats to continue to make health care a top election issue, will run in multiple languages, according to the committee.

The ad buy follows presidential contender and billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg lending a sliver of his personal fortune to the arms race on the current congressional battlefield.
On Wednesday, a senior aide to Bloomberg confirmed he will donate $10 million to the House Majority PAC to help defend vulnerable House Democrats, as they face a slew of well-financed Republican attacks on their support of impeachment against Trump. The latest move continues his long history of deep-pocketed donations to buttress candidates. In the 2018 midterm elections, he spent upwards of $100 million on House Democrats, supporting their efforts to flip the chamber.

The legislation passed Thursday, named the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act in memory of the congressman who died earlier this year, is a key plank of Democrats' 2018 winning campaign platform, which helped them overtake the House majority.
Trump, who campaigned on making lowering drug costs a top priority, opposes the measure, which passed 230-192 in the House with unanimous support from Democrats. The bill is not expected to make it through the Senate. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Tuesday night, saying, ""If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto the bill.""

Regardless of the GOP's lack of support for H.R. 3, Democrats are training their focus on the issues.

""Democrats are keeping our promises on health care,"" said Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez in a statement on the passage of H.R. 3. ""We’re working to lower drug prices for middle-class families and passing historic investments in Medicare, while Trump’s agenda spikes costs, jeopardizes protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slashes billions from Medicare and Medicaid. As Trump and Republicans break their promises at every turn, Democrats will keep working to improve the lives of everyday Americans.""

FBI director pushes back on conspiracy theory,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-pushes-back-debunked-conspiracy-theory-2016/story?id=67609244,"
FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday undercut a theory pushed by President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies that the government of Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

""We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,"" Wray told ABC News in an exclusive broadcast interview on Monday.NEW: Asked about Pres. Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Rudy Giuliani and others, FBI Dir. Chris Wray tells @PierreTABC, “we have no information” supporting the theory. https://t.co/mYAwH5acs4 pic.twitter.com/2qiF6ZwKze— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019 NEW: Asked about Pres. Trump’s desire for Ukraine to investigate debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Rudy Giuliani and others, FBI Dir. Chris Wray tells @PierreTABC, “we have no information” supporting the theory. https://t.co/mYAwH5acs4 pic.twitter.com/2qiF6ZwKze
Wray is the most senior, currently serving, government official to undercut the claim -- pushed as recently as Sunday by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in an interview about the ongoing impeachment inquiry.
""Here's the game the media is playing. Because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election,"" Cruz said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

When asked about the claim, Wray urged Americans to be cautious about their sources of information.
""Well, look, there's all kinds of people saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information, to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear,"" he said. ""And I think part of us being well protected against malign foreign influence is to build together an American public that's resilient, that has appropriate media literacy and that takes its information with a grain of salt.""
In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump requested he look into claims about ""CrowdStrike,"" referencing a debunked conspiracy theory that claims Ukraine, not Russia, hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer networks in 2016.

Asked about that theory, Wray didn't directly respond to the president's claim but underscored that the FBI has no evidence to support such a claim.
""As I said, we at the FBI have no information that would indicate that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"" he said.

In addition, Wray said that he didn't speak with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, about any investigation into the Bidens.

""I haven't had any conversations with Rudy Giuliani,"" Wray said.

Wray also cautioned that election interference is still a concern moving into 2020.

""Well, as far as the election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat to the election cycle itself,"" he said.

""But we certainly know that other nation states, China, Iran, others have an interest in influencing our democracy in other ways through different forms of engagement, different types of malign foreign influence. So we are trying to make sure that we're working hard with others to protect America against all those threats,"" Wray added."
Prosecutors request bail be revoked for Rudy Giuliani associate,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bail-revoked-rudy-giuliani-associate-lev-parnas/story?id=67670466,"
Federal prosecutors in New York have asked a judge to revoke bail for Rudy Giuliani-associate Lev Parnas

""There is no set of conditions that will reasonably ensure his appearance and compliance with the terms of his release,"" prosecutors said.

Parnas is accused of making false statements to pretrial services regarding his assets and income.
Prosecutors also said he represents an extreme risk of flight, compounded by ""continuing and troublesome misrepresentations to pretrial services.

In their filing Wednesday night, prosecutors say, ""Parnas failed to disclose ... the fact that in September 2019, he received $1 million from a bank account in Russia.""
An attorney for Parnas told ABC News he is ""reviewing"" the filing from the Southern District.

""We will file a written response in the coming days,"" Parnas' lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, told ABC News. ""We look forward to a hearing next week in court.""

Parnas was arrested on Oct. 9, along with associate Igor Fruman, and charged with four counts, including conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud, false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and falsification of records.
They have pleaded not guilty.

According to the original indictment, Parnas sought then-Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's ouster earlier this year along with his efforts to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the president's political rival, matters that have repeatedly emerged in the House impeachment inquiry.

As ABC News has previously reported, Giuliani's relationship with Parnas and Fruman is the subject of a criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York, according to sources familiar with the matter.
