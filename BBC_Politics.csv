"PM 'misrepresenting' Brexit deal, says Corbyn",https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50684881,"Jeremy Corbyn has said a leaked document obtained by Labour shows Boris Johnson is ""misrepresenting"" his Brexit deal and the ""devastating"" impact it will have on Northern Ireland.He called the paper ""hard evidence"" NI would be ""symbolically separated"" from the rest of the UK after Brexit, with customs checks on goods. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said there will be no border in the Irish Sea.He dismissed Labour's claims as ""complete nonsense"".Asked about the document during a campaign visit in Kent, Mr Johnson said he had not seen it but insisted his agreement would offer ""unfettered access"" to the British market for Northern Ireland businesses.The Conservatives said the leaked Treasury document was an ""immediate assessment, not a detailed analysis"".It had not been written for ""decision-making purposes"" or been seen by the PM, the chancellor or ""any of the senior officials involved in the negotiations"", the party added.But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who oppose the agreement, said it had warned Mr Johnson that it would be bad for Northern Ireland and this was ""further evidence"". The row comes as the leaders prepare for the last TV debate of the election on BBC One on Friday at 20:30.Ahead of the encounter, Labour sought to increase the pressure on the prime minister, who has claimed his agreement with the EU on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will ""get Brexit done"" by 31 January. Mr Johnson has said the whole of the UK will leave the EU at the same time and that there will be no checks on any goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.At a press conference in London, Mr Corbyn said the 15-page Treasury document - titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market - disproved this and showed Mr Johnson's claims about his own deal were ""fraudulent"". By John Campbell, the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editorThe analysis in this leaked document matches that published in a government risk assessment in October.The initial study said the PM's deal could mean a reduction in business investment, consumer spending and trade in Northern Ireland. But this time the language is even blunter and confirms the worst fears of unionists.It concludes that the deal would see ""Northern Ireland symbolically separated from the Union.""And it once again suggests the government has not been straight about the extent of new red tape on trade across the Irish Sea. Page one of the document says ""at a minimum exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from NI to GB"".The prime minister has repeatedly said those declarations would not be required.""What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson's own government, marked official, sensitive, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,"" he said.""This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country, 15 pages that paint a damning picture of Johnson's deal on the issue of Northern Ireland in particular.""As well as customs and security checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, he said goods moving the other way would be subject to regulatory and rules of origin checks and potentially tariffs - which would force up prices and be highly ""disruptive"". ""This drives a coach and horses through Boris Johnson's claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea.""Before he succeeded Theresa May as prime minister, Mr Johnson told the DUP's annual conference in 2018 that no UK government could agree to any border in the Irish Sea. Mr Corbyn said this showed Mr Johnson's word could not be trusted.But the prime minister said his agreement was superior to his predecessor's as it would give the Stormont Assembly the power to decide whether to remain aligned with the EU after four years.Mr Johnson said the only checks would be on British exports to the Republic of Ireland going via Northern Ireland.BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said this was not correct, as the agreement actually envisaged checks at Northern Irish ports on British goods not formally bound for the Republic, with items ""at risk"" of being transported on there being liable for duties. This Treasury document sets out things that trade experts have been saying pretty clearly, but that the government has refused to accept.Boris Johnson's EU Withdrawal Agreement says customs declarations and documentary and physical checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be ""highly disruptive to the Northern Ireland economy"".The document notes that 98% of businesses that export to Great Britain are small and medium businesses that are ""likely to struggle"" to bear the cost.None of this is a huge surprise to anyone committed enough to have read the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland carefully, but it is not what the prime minister has been saying about his own deal.Another striking line from the leaked document says the withdrawal agreement ""has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK's internal market"".That is why, in a nutshell, Mr Johnson lost the support of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, and it was his lack of a working majority in Parliament that led in turn to this.Under the PM's agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. Northern Ireland will also continue to follow EU customs rules but will remain part of the UK's customs territory.A government risk assessment published in October said it would lead to new administration and checks on goods from west to east. But Mr Johnson has insisted Northern Irish businesses will not be hit with additional paperwork or fees, telling a BBC phone-in during the campaign that ""we will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB"".The DUP said it would use whatever influence it had in the next Parliament to push for changes to the agreement.  ""Despite the prime minister's protestations, the facts are in black and white,"" said spokesman Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. ""We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal.""Mr Corbyn said Labour's promise of another referendum within six months of his winning power would ""end the division"" over Brexit as well as protecting jobs and the peace in Northern Ireland.Under Labour's plans, voters would get to choose between a ""credible"" renegotiated Leave deal, including a customs union with the EU and a close single market relationship, and staying in the EU under current terms. However, Mr Corbyn again declined to say which way he would vote - saying he would not ""take sides"" so he could faithfully carry out the result. In contrast, his chief Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said he would campaign against the new deal Labour negotiated and back remain.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don't back up his wild conspiracy theories.""But Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the document showed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal ""would be in fact a knockout blow to the economy of Northern Ireland"".SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said it made it ""clear"" that ""Scotland will take a disproportionate hit from Boris Johnson's disastrous Tory Brexit deal"".Speaking in Dublin, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said that under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal Northern Ireland would ""remain in the UK customs territory and, at the same time, benefit from access to the single market without tariffs, quotas, checks or controls"".""EU state aid and VAT rules will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, under the control of the European Court of Justice,"" he added."
Johnson 'could look at' abolishing BBC licence fee,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50718366,"Boris Johnson has said the possible abolition of the BBC licence fee needs ""looking at"".Speaking at a rally in Sunderland, the prime minister questioned how much longer funding a broadcaster out of ""a general tax"" could be ""justified"".Ministers have agreed the licence fee will stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends.The fee for a colour TV licence is currently £154.50 a year. It will rise in line with inflation until 2022.Licence fee income was worth £3.6bn to the BBC in 2018-9, accounting for approximately 75% of the broadcaster's revenues and funding TV, radio and online content. Last year, 25.8 million households had TV licences.The government and the BBC are currently involved in a dispute over the funding of free TV licences for the over-75s.Mr Johnson was asked by a member of the public whether he would consider axing all TV licences.The prime minister said that, while he would not make up policy with three days to go before the election, it was an issue that was worth ""looking at"" in the future. ""You have to ask yourself whether that approach to funding a media company still makes sense in the long term given the way that other organisations manage to fund themselves,"" he said.""The system of funding out of what is a general tax bears reflection. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels.""Various alternatives to the licence fee have been floated over the years, including subscription services or a compulsory broadcasting levy. It is customary for election campaigns to strain relations between the BBC and whoever happens to be in government. But the advent of social media - where criticism of the BBC frequently goes viral - and the rise of streaming giants which operate a different model, has increased pressure on the BBC recently. So too has the prime minister's refusal to be interviewed by Andrew Neil for the BBC. Last week, Mr Neil, who interviewed all the other party leaders, issued a challenge to Mr Johnson, and showed an empty chair. That clip has been viewed several million times on social media. No 10 didn't appreciate that much, and doubled down on its position. Lured by the internet, many younger viewers now spend much more time on Netflix or YouTube than watching BBC services. That does pose a significant, perhaps existential, challenge to the BBC in the long term.The BBC has always argued, however, that the licence fee is vital to its public service model and that if it moved to a subscription model it would necessarily be driven only by those who could afford a subscription, and not the whole country.Sooner or later, a decision needs to be made about how best the BBC can compete, and satisfy the British public, in today's global media. It's probably best that discussion takes place when there isn't an election on.At the time of the last Charter Renewal in 2016, the government said the licence fee was likely to become ""less sustainable in the long run"".While ministers said there were no plans to replace it with a subscription model, they said the BBC should be given an opportunity to explore whether to make any of its content available on a subscription-only basis.In its manifesto, Labour says it will ensure a ""healthy future"" for all public service broadcasters, while the Liberal Democrats are promising to ""protect the independence of the BBC and set up a BBC Licence Fee Commission"".The Brexit Party is pledging to ""phase out"" the licence fee."
How many trees can you plant in a day?,https://www.bbc.com/news/50591261,"The political parties have been promising huge increases in tree planting in their election manifestos.The most eye-catching is Labour's plan to plant two billion trees by 2040.Impossible, some say - that's more than a quarter of a million trees every day. But it's not necessarily unrealistic. It's just that it will require a sea change in the way things are done today. In the year to March 2019, the number of trees planted across the UK went up: 13,400 hectares of new woodland was planted. Most of it was in Scotland (11,200 hectares), while there was actually a decrease in planting in England. But these UK-wide figures fall way short of where they were in the late 1980s, when about 30,000 hectares were planted every year. Experts who advocate sustainable woodland are not huge fans of the way planting was done in that decade, but it does show that the current rate of planting could rise dramatically.Meanwhile, the Conservatives have pledged to plant at least 30 million more trees every year, the Lib Dems and the SNP each say they will plant 60 million trees a year, while the Green Party would aim to plant 700 million trees by 2030. Tree-planting How many trees are the parties pledging to plant?Labour: 100m a year (2bn by 2040)Greens: 70m a yearLib Dems: 60m a yearSNP: 60m targeta year Conservatives: 30ma yearIt's difficult to say precisely because trees can be planted at a density of anything between 1,000 and 2,500 per hectare.  But if you take a mid-range, then planting 30,000 hectares means you are planting roughly (and we should stress this is an estimate) 50 million trees a year.That's still a long way short of the rate of planting Labour would need to achieve, in order to meet its target. But it suggests that it could be done. UK, 1976-2019Experts can plant trees incredibly quickly. But the Woodland Trust, the UK's largest woodland conservation charity, says several things need to happen to encourage a huge tree-planting programme:""We know that the investment needed will pay back,"" says Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust. ""It will require landowners willing to provide the public benefits that society needs, and public funds to support it.""The Committee on Climate Change, a statutory body which provides advice to government, says the UK needs a net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland every year for the next 30 years, in order to help achieve the legally-binding target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. That equates to about one-and-a-half billion trees. Again that sounds like an awful lot, but at the moment only 13% of the UK's land area is covered in trees (and in England it is 10%). The aim is to increase that UK-wide figure to 17% by 2050. The average tree cover across the EU is about 35%, so it's actually quite a modest overall target.To put things into further perspective, there have been multiple efforts elsewhere in the world to plant millions of trees in a single day.Guinness World Records say roughly 50 million were planted by volunteers in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on a single day in 2016. So, ambitious targets for the UK should not be dismissed out of hand. But to get there, from where we are now, will take a gargantuan effort. And political promises on tree planting have been broken before. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touchRead more from Reality CheckFollow us on Twitter"
Who gets to take part in opinion polls?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50247874,"In the run-up to the general election, we will hear a lot more about how the parties are doing in the opinion polls and who the next government might be.But how do the polls work, whose opinions are asked and how valuable are the results? Opinion polls provide a snapshot of people's views on a particular issue. They are widely used when elections are approaching.People may be asked things like which party they would vote for, their views on party leaders and which issues most concern them.Opinion polls can be useful to see how different parties are doing, but they may not reflect the make-up of the next Parliament.The UK's first-past-the-post voting system means that the local candidate in each constituency who receives the most votes becomes an MP. And the party with the most winning candidates nationally normally forms a government. So, a party that is predicted to have 10% more of the vote than its main rival, for example, will not always end up with 10% more MPs.They are not perfect, but the average of errors on polls going back more than 70 years is only a couple of points, says Will Jennings of the University of Southampton.Over the last few elections, 90% of polls conducted just before the election have been within four percentage points of the vote share for the major parties.During this general election campaign, the clear trend has been the Conservatives and Labour going up - and the Brexit Party and Lib Dems going down.Poll results were criticised after both the 2015 and 2017 general elections.A review by the British Polling Council said that polls before the 2015 vote were among the most inaccurate since surveying began. They failed to predict the Conservative Party's majority win and over-represented Labour voters.The review suggested the main reason was unrepresentative sampling.Two years later, the opinion polls all suggested a clear Conservative lead over Labour in the run-up to the election. While the Tories did win, it was without the predicted majority.The polls were right about theirs and the Lib Dems' vote share, but they were wrong about Labour's. It was also thought that an assumption of a low turnout from younger voters was wrong.The number of people questioned varies from poll to poll. Most political polls ask between 1,000 and 2,000 people. However, to be involved you usually need to have signed up to be on a survey panel, unless the poll is conducted by phone or in person.People do not join these panels specifically to give their views on politics. Many will only ever be questioned on issues like their views on the best pizza delivery firm or where they go on holiday.But the panels are also generally where the opinion poll companies collect their views at election time.The panels can be very big - some containing up to one million participants. However, the actual number of people actively taking part on a regular basis may be only about 25% of such a total.People are given various incentives, such as shopping vouchers or a small financial reward, for doing the surveys.Many people will never be asked questions by pollsters, but this does not mean that polls are not accurate. Two methods of ensuring that polls represent the voice of the nation are random sampling and quota sampling.The random way involves pulling out people's contact details from a list and contacting them.Quota sampling means having certain numbers of people of certain ages, genders and locations taking part in a survey.During this election campaign YouGov published a poll based on the views of 100,000 voters, applying national trends to individual constituencies.The results of polls can often be released very quickly. A poll can be finished in the afternoon and the results published later that evening.Polls are helpful for tracking changes in support for the different political parties. But they can only ever provide an approximate picture and shouldn't be treated as a reliable guide to what will happen in the election. It's particularly important to look at long-term trends - rather than focusing on individual polls. The BBC has strict rules about this. So you will never see the result of a poll in the headlines of a TV news bulletin for example.Instead we look at the polls over time in the BBC poll tracker. That takes in all voting intention polls published by members of the British Polling Council. The BBC's aim is to try to smooth out specific errors in any individual poll. However, it's still possible for all of the polls to be systematically inaccurate. So even the tracker should be treated with the right degree of caution."
Lib Dems pledge help for small businesses,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50698834,"The Liberal Democrats plan to scrap business rates to help small firms and will provide greater support for entrepreneurs, if the party wins the general election on Thursday.Nearly a million businesses in the UK have closed in the past three years, analysis from the Lib Dems suggests.The party says Brexit uncertainty has added to the high street's demise.Labour says it will base a network of small business advisers in Post Office branches if it wins the election.Meanwhile, the Conservatives have said they will reduce business rates for smaller firms and give them a larger discount on National Insurance payments. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is due to visit Hertfordshire on Saturday - Small Business Saturday - to discuss her policies with the owners of small businesses in a bid to convince them to back her party, which is in favour of revoking Article 50 and stopping Brexit.Citing figures from the Office for National Statistics, the Lib Dems said 978,285 businesses closed their doors between 2016 and 2018 - a 28% rise from the 765,000 that shut over the previous three years.The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has previously warned the government of the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the UK and European Union, saying that leaving with a deal is essential to protect the economy and jobs.Sam Gyimah, Lib Dem shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday that it was ""no coincidence"" that in a period of such uncertainty, businesses had to close their doors.Mr Gyimah said: ""We have a situation where the Conservatives and the Labour Party are going to throw the economic cards up in the air and gamble with our future. And all the other things pale in comparison when you look at the issue of Brexit and its consequences.""The Lib Dems plan to boost small businesses by replacing business rates with a new land value tax on landlords, and expand the ""future high streets fund"" to support redevelopment in town centres and high streets.A new ""start-up allowance"" supporting business owners with their living costs in their first few weeks is also being pledged.Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem spokesman and former Labour MP, warned that ""crashing out"" of the EU would see ""even more damage to businesses up and down the country"".Mr Umunna accused the Conservative government of having ""completely failed"" small businesses, ""saddling them with years of Brexit uncertainty and ignoring urgent calls to reform business rates"".""Liberal Democrats are proud to be a party that supports businesses. We will stop Brexit, get back to dealing with the issues that really matter to small businesses, and build a brighter future,"" Mr Umunna added."
Tories claim first scalps in Wales election results,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766203,"Wales' first female Conservative MP has been elected after the party took two targeted seats from Labour.Sarah Atherton's 2,131 majority win in Wrexham followed the Vale of Clwyd which James Davies regained after losing his seat two years ago.Exit polls have forecast a large Tory majority in the UK.Labour held on to Caerphilly and Swansea West, while Plaid Cymru held on to Arfon with Hywel Williams increasing his majority from 92 to 2,781.According to exit polls, the Tories appear on course to take 368 seats, 50 more than the last election. In Wales, Wrexham, Vale of Clwyd, Clwyd South, Delyn, Bridgend, and Alyn and Deeside are forecast to turn blue.Labour is forecast to take an estimated 191 seats, down 71 from the 2017 poll. Plaid Cymru is forecast to take three seats, down one.After 7 of 40 seatsIf you cannot see the graphic click here.Paul Davies, the Conservative leader in the Welsh assembly, said: ""People want to see Brexit delivered and that's why they have come out to vote for us, if this poll is correct.""His predecessor Andrew RT Davies said: ""People across the country have stood up and told their politicians that democracy should be respected and have also emphatically rejected the hard-left socialist dogma of Jeremy Corbyn.""Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies said he was ""very encouraged by what we have seen so far"", and the former Gower MP said the constituency was looking ""close"".Meanwhile, Russell George, Tory AM for Montgomeryshire, said his constituency was looking ""positive"" for his party, as was the current Lib Dem seat of Brecon and Radnorshire.Labour's Chris Bryant, who is standing in the Rhondda, called it the ""worst night for Labour since 1935"". Speaking on BBC Wales' Election 2019 programme, he said his party would have ""lost four elections in a row"" and were now looking at ""being out in the wilderness for even longer"" unless there was ""some serious soul-searching"".Stephen Kinnock, the party's Aberavon candidate said if the exit poll was correct he would ""urge"" Jeremy Corbyn to consider his position.""I think he has to seriously consider his position. I don't think a leader who has lost two elections can seriously just stand up and pretend that nothing has happened,"" he said.""If you're losing your heartland seats you're losing your sense of purpose, your sense of mission.""Vaughan Gething, Welsh Labour health minister, said if the exit poll was borne out it would be a ""bad night for the Labour party"" and ""a bad night for the country"".The pro-EU politician said voters had seen both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as ""marmite"".""We did understand that traditional Labour voters, older Labour voters, had a real issue voting Labour in this election,"" he said.Stephen Doughty, who has held the Cardiff South and Penarth seat for seven years, tweeted: ""I fear the future for our younger generation. I fear for the public institutions and integrity of our country. Dark times. Some of us must offer new hope amidst despair.""However, Plaid Cymru AM Delyth Jewell struck a note of caution, saying two of the seats the party was defending were ultra-marginal.""I would have liked to have seen us having more seats, but we always knew this was going to be difficult,"" she said.Welsh Liberal Democrat Baroness Randerson said the exit poll was ""obviously disappointing"". ""When we've been canvassing it seemed at times like an unpopularity contest between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn,"" she added.Other seats that could change hands include Ynys Mon, Arfon, Brecon and Radnorshire, and Gower.Prof Laura McAllister, from Cardiff University, speaking on the BBC Wales Election 2019 programme, said: ""There's irony here if these results do play out. Labour might be looking at having the bulk of its MPs in the south Wales valleys - the part of Wales which is most resistant to Jeremy Corbyn. ""It will be interesting how that plays out for the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, who is himself a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn.""But Prof Roger Awan-Scully, also of Cardiff University, said: ""The Conservatives record of winning any post-war general election is winning 14 seats in Wales.""I think that could well be under threat tonight and we could be on course for a historic Conservative performance.""We could see the Labour Party wiped out in north east Wales and under threat in a number of south Wales seats as well."""
Tories probe candidates over anti-Semitism claims,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50700874,"Three Conservative election candidates are being investigated over allegations of anti-Semitism, the party has confirmed.Sally-Ann Hart, Richard Short and Lee Anderson are facing claims relating to their social media use.Labour has called for the candidates to be suspended, adding that leader Boris Johnson ""must answer for the anti-Semitism being promoted in his name"".A Conservative spokeswoman said abuse or discrimination of any kind is wrong.Among those who are facing an investigation is Sally-Ann Hart, the Tory candidate in Hastings and Rye, which is ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd's former seat.Also being investigated is Richard Short, who is standing in St Helens South and Whiston, and Lee Anderson, who is running in Ashfield and Eastwood.A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: ""These matters are being investigated.""She added: ""We are committed to stamping out the scourge of anti-Semitism in our society and supporting our Jewish community.""Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one, but there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour, including conditions to undertake training, periods of suspension and expulsion, and these are applied on a case-by-case basis."" The probe comes after leader Mr Johnson previously told reporters that ""if anybody is done for Islamophobia, or any other prejudice or discrimination in the Conservative Party they are out first bounce"".Andrew Gwynne, Labour's national campaign co-ordinator, said: ""Boris Johnson said members who make racist comments are 'out first bounce'. So why is he refusing to suspend these three candidates, none of whom appear to have apologised?""Johnson has never called out and condemned anti-Semitic Soros narratives among his supporters.""On the contrary, the Conservatives whipped their MEPs to vote in support of the Hungarian government which peddles the Soros conspiracy and appointed a senior government adviser who promotes this narrative.""Mr Gwynne added: ""Anti-Semitism is clearly rife in the Conservative Party from top to bottom.""Johnson must answer for the anti-Semitism being promoted in his name.""Jewish multi-billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who has given away £32bn, has been the topic of numerous fake news stories and conspiracy theories, many of which are anti-Semitic.Under electoral law, if a candidate is suspended after nominations close, they will still appear on the ballot paper and affiliated to that party. Mr Johnson has previously apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" that has been caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party.Meanwhile, Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Corbyn has apologised for incidents of anti-Semitism in Labour on several occasions and said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong""."

Pound soars on exit poll forecast of Tory majority,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50766233,"The pound surged against the dollar after an exit poll indicated that the Conservative Party has secured an 86-seat majority in the general election.Sterling gained 3% to $1.35 - its highest level since May last year - on hopes that a big majority would remove uncertainty over Brexit.The pound also jumped to a three-and-a-half-year high against the euro. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 January.The BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, said a big win for the Conservatives pushed leaving the EU without a deal into the distance, and the financial markets are breathing a sigh of relief.""The most disruptive form of no deal has been taken off the table. The market reaction is a reflection not just of the result, but of the fact that [a big majority] gives the prime minister room for manoeuvre.""UBS Wealth Management economist Dean Turner said: ""Just as Boris Johnson was desperately seeking his majority, this result would give the markets their ultimate wish: clarity.""Capital Economics chief UK economist Paul Dales said there is no guarantee that the exit poll numbers will be confirmed as the results of the general election come in overnight.But he said: ""If the Conservatives do win a majority, passing a Brexit divorce deal in the coming weeks would remove any risk of a no deal Brexit on 31 January, reduce the immediate uncertainty and lift business investment at least a bit. ""And in a Budget in February, the Conservatives would probably give the economy an extra kick by raising public investment by up to £20bn.

McDonnell underlines Labour pledges on inequality,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50659150,"Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has outlined his party's pledges on inequality, blaming 10 years of Tory government for increased living costs.In a speech in the West Midlands, he said Labour's plans could save families more than £6,700 a year, although experts have questioned this figure.He reiterated measures including raising the living wage to £10 an hour and scrapping universal credit.But the Tories said Labour's ""reckless pledges"" will mean higher bills.And last month influential research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said neither the Conservatives nor Labour were offering ""credible"" spending plans ahead of the general election on 12 December.Speaking at an event in Birmingham Mr McDonnell said his party wanted to ""abolish poverty once and for all"", saying the level of inequality in Britain was not reflective of a country with Christian roots.""Children going hungry and homeless in the fifth largest economy in the world begs the question: are we really living up to the values of Christianity - or any other of our religions or beliefs for that matter?"" he said.""We don't believe it's enough to offer people a hand up out of poverty. We want to abolish poverty.""That's why we committed in our manifesto to abolishing in-work poverty within five years.""Labour's figures for boosting household income may not stand up to close scrutiny - mixing immediate benefits with less certain promises of lower utility bills in future.But the political message that ""you will be better off with Labour"" is seen by some party insiders not only as essential, but overdue.John McDonnell's speech was in the West Midlands - part of the country where traditional Labour voters who backed Brexit are showing more willingness to support the Conservatives this time.And they need good reasons to. In union leader Len McCluskey's words: ""Come home to Labour.""It was felt that Labour's myriad ""retail offers"" - from free broadband to reducing rail fares and offering free prescriptions and dental checks - hadn't been quite as popular as anticipated.So the announcements are being repackaged, to get across the message that the party will put money in your pockets, unless you are already well-off.This in part was due to Labour being put on the back foot on its tax plans, getting bogged down in arguing over whether anyone outside the top 5% would be worse off.Now the party wants to go on the front foot and stress that the message isn't so much ""you won't pay any more"", it is: ""overall, you will benefit.""Another problem is that voters are sceptical that Labour can deliver.So over the next week, expect to see more details on how Labour will prioritise its programme.Attacking the Conservatives, Mr McDonnell said: ""While wages are still lower than before the financial crash, inaction and economic mismanagement by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats over the last decade has meant the cost of living for most households has actually soared.""He said Labour's manifesto will ""tackle the burden of rising living costs"".Mr McDonnell added that, over the next few days, he would put together an outline of what the first 100 days of a Labour government would look like.""We want to hit the ground running,"" he said.""We can't wait for the implementation of those policies because they are so desperately needed.""Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, said: ""It defies belief that Corbyn's Labour are claiming they would reduce living costs at the same time as standing on a manifesto containing tax rises which would hit ordinary hardworking people across the country.""He said the Conservatives have pledged to cut taxes and will introduce ""record increases"" in the National Living Wage, adding: ""Labour can't be trusted with the economy and their reckless pledges will mean higher bills and more tax for everyone.""Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Ed Davey said Mr McDonnell's promises were ""worth nothing as long as Labour is committed to negotiating Brexit"".""Either a Tory or Labour Brexit would mean less money in people's pockets and less tax revenue to fund our public services,"" he said."
Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49798197,"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election.The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off.That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static.Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats.If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote.It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017.And there are only ten days to go.Our poll tracker smooths out the bumps in polling by including old polls.Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures.The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you.That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar.But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. 28 November 2019YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest.A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies.Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68.However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons.It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority.Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate.Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll.That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December.So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be.One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies.If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them.Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems.The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%.Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls.Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign.In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall.There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures.Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time.However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country.The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies.Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive.Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before.The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before.In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017.As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats.That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending.Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs.Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons.A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week.These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends.But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up.If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two.We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down.The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party.Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing.Other pollsters have said they will follow suit.We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency.So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks.Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape.  But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately.We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down.The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party.Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing.Other pollsters have said they will follow suit.We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency.So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks.Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape.  But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately.The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days.The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer.Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case.Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April.And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago.YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland.In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%.Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place.The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems.However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date.There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December.There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast.Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards.There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September.Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days.There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore?Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election.Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign.However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit.That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place.It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects.Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue.On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options.The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls.In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards.Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat.Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate.Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes.The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain.  Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year.The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls.The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say.Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party.There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?).We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov.Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference.We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available.The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points.This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on a British Polling Council analysis of the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017.The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK.This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics in Scotland and Wales on their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source.  In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people.Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like.In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking.But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female).So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population.One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting.That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results.Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different.It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference.Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for?Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another partyPrior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"".

Javid's homelessness statistics questioned,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50721308,"The chancellor's use of statistics has been questioned after he said the number of homeless people peaked in 2008, under the last Labour government.The UK Statistics Authority received complaints after Sajid Javid made the claim on Sky News and BBC Radio 5 Live on 5 December.Mr Javid also said that since then the number has decreased by almost half. The Conservative Party has since said that the chancellor misremembered the statistics.The UK Statistics Authority, an independent body, says figures from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government show that ""statutory homelessness in England peaked in 2003 before falling to a low of around 42,000 households in 2009. ""Between 2009 and 2017, statutory homelessness then increased from this low point to around 58,000 households.""It added: ""Other statistics show that there has been an increasing trend in the number of households living in temporary accommodation over the last decade.Following recommendations made by the Authority in 2015, MHCLG have been improving the UK's suite of homelessness statistics.""On the same day as Mr Javid made the statements, Labour announced new plans to tackle homelessness, including £100m a year for emergency winter shelters, £600m to build new hostels, and £200m to refurbish existing ones.Separately, the Liberal Democrats have said they would end rough sleeping in England within five years,Their plans include introducing a duty on local authorities to provide immediate emergency accommodation and abolishing no-fault evictions.The Conservatives, Labour and the Green Party have also said they want to end rough sleeping."
Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge',https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50711868,"Putting Boris Johnson's plan for Brexit into action will be a ""major"" challenge for government due to new customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, according to a leaked document. The PM has said the UK will fully exit the EU by December 2020 if he wins the election and MPs approve his plan. But the document says government will struggle to deliver the infrastructure and staffing needed by that deadline.The PM did not directly comment on the report when asked.But Mr Johnson instead said his plan was a ""great deal"" for both Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and would ""give the country real momentum"". The SNP said the leak was ""just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson can't be trusted"".It comes as the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said Mr Johnson ""broke [his] word"" after promising there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit - a red line for her and her candidates. Throughout the election campaign, the PM has denied there will be checks in the Irish Sea, despite telling the BBC in the days after his deal was agreed that some checks would be needed.Mr Johnson's deal with the EU does mean there will be checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks on goods going in the other direction.Mr Johnson has pledged to finalise leaving the EU by 31 January, and said a trade deal will be done with the bloc by the following December. However, he has also said if no deal is done by that deadline, the UK will still leave - meaning all transition agreements will come to an end by the close of 2020.First reported by the Financial Times, the document from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) has cast doubt on whether the government will be ready to meet this proposal when it comes to new arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BBC has also seen the document - which was circulated to senior officials in Whitehall last week - that warns of ""high levels of checks and controls"" as a result of the deal, and says there may be ""legal and political"" impacts.  It reads: ""Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.""DExEU said it would not comment on leaks. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who sits on the ""exit operations committee"" for Brexit planning - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been ""incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on"".He said such planning meant the UK was in ""very good shape, not just to deal with new trading relationships, but all the other things"". Commenting on the leak, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""Even his own civil servants know the UK government aren't in a position to deliver Brexit on his promised timescale.""If we leave the EU, the UK faces years of difficult and contentious trade talks. If you've not liked Brexit so far, you ain't seen nothing yet.""The pro-Leave DUP has previously backed the Conservative Party, giving Theresa May a working majority in Parliament, but it has been critical of both her withdrawal agreement with the EU and Mr Johnson's.Speaking to Today, Ms Foster said the DUP had spoken to HMRC officials after Mr Johnson's deal was done, and they had made it ""very clear"" to her that there would need to be checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.""This is very concerning for us as it goes to the heart of the act of union,"" she said.""Boris wants to, in his words, 'get Brexit done', and I completely understand that. But you can't leave part of the UK in a worse-off position.""Asked repeatedly whether she could now trust anything the prime minister said, Ms Foster added: ""It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the words but the detail. It says more about the person who broke their word."""
Alliance's Stephen Farry wins North Down,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766004,"Stephen Farry of the Alliance Party has won North Down, the first seat declared in Northern Ireland.Mr Farry, deputy leader of the party, defeated Alex Easton of the DUP by just under 3,000 votes.North Belfast remains too close to call while the SDLP is confident of winning Foyle.Mr Farry won 18,358 votes to Mr Easton's 15,390 to take the seat formerly held by independent MP Lady Hermon.North Down was represented by Lady Hermon from 2001 until she stepped down this year.Meanwhile the DUP's Jim Shannon was re-elected in Strangford with a majority of 7,000.In North Belfast BBC News NI political reporter Jayne McCormack has heard Sinn Féin's John Finucane is on course to take the seat from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.The UK-wide exit poll released at 22:00 GMT suggests a large majority for the Conservative Party with more than 360 seats.Some 102 candidates are competing for the 18 Westminster seats allocated to Northern Ireland.A total of 1,293,971 people were eligible to vote at 1,300 polling stations in Northern Ireland - up by 51,000 from the last general election.An exit poll is not conducted in Northern Ireland.In his victory speech, Mr Farry said that ""voters had sent out a clear message that North Down wanted to remain [in the EU]"".He said there was no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit and that ""all forms of Brexit are damaging for Britain"".Mr Farry added that Northern Ireland still stands up for Remain and if the prime minister was determined to push ahead with a hard Brexit that would have ""massive implications"".The first results in the 2017 general election were known at about 01:00.This time around there are fewer count centres - just four across Northern Ireland in Belfast, Magherafelt, Omagh and Bangor. You can use the feature below to search for your constituency and see results. If you can't see it click here. If the exit poll results are borne out the Conservative Party will not require the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to help it achieve a working majority.The DUP propped up Theresa May's minority administration for two years following the 2017 general election.But the party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said as Mr Johnson sought a trade deal with the EU there would still be opportunities for the DUP to influence proceedings.Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey said if the exit poll proved accurate it would take the ""dead hand"" of the Tory-DUP relationship away from the political process in Northern Ireland.He predicted it would make it more likely that the DUP would do a deal with his party to restore devolved government.The power-sharing executive at Stormont collapsed in January 2017 after a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin over a flawed green energy scheme.Fresh talks aimed at restoring the executive are due to start on Monday.Meanwhile Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said if the exit poll is correct Northern Ireland is in for a ""world of hurt"" with Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.The Alliance Party will be thinking their decision to stand candidates in all 18 constituencies- and not get involved in a pro-remain pact - has paid off.Not only have they taken North Down with Stephen Farry's win, but in East Antrim and Lagan Valley - two DUP strongholds - they are running a closer race than expected and the DUP vote looks to be down.""A very good night,"" an Alliance source tells me, also indicating they could be playing for third spot in South Down.Alliance went into this election hoping to re-take East Belfast but are now hopeful for entirely different reasons.They are privately conceding they are unlikely to defeat DUP's Gavin Robinson, but I'm also hearing it will be closer this time than two years ago.Voters faced some wet and windy weather, but turnout was said to be high in many places."
SNP pledges 'could mean more austerity' - IFS,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50657846,"Introducing the SNP's general election pledges in an independent Scotland could lead to more austerity, according to an economic research group.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the SNP's manifesto set out plans to increase spending while also setting out a list of tax-cutting measures. It said the SNP had not costed these pledges, unlike the other main parties. But it said spending cuts would have to be made elsewhere, or other taxes would have to rise to pay for them.The IFS has previously said that the spending pledges of both the Conservatives and Labour ahead of the election were ""not credible"", and accused both parties of not being honest with voters.It said the Liberal Democrats' manifesto would involve lower levels of borrowing than under Labour or the Conservatives, but would still be seen as ""radical"" in ""most periods"".The SNP manifesto was unveiled last month by leader Nicola Sturgeon, who said her party was offering Scottish voters a chance to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"".In his analysis of the SNP's manifesto, IFS associate director David Phillips said it differed from those of the other three major parties because it was not ""a plan of action for five years of governing the UK"".Writing in the Scotsman newspaper, Mr Phillips argued that the document was instead about ""starting the process of leaving the UK in the next year"".He highlighted the party's call for the UK government to dramatically increase spending on the NHS in England, which would add hundreds of millions of pounds to the Scottish government budget through the Barnett Formula.He said spending proposals such as the abolition of the so-called ""bedroom tax"", ending the two-child cap on means-tested benefits and other increases to Universal Credit would benefit low-income, working age families.But he said other proposals aimed at pensioners, such as keeping universal free TV licences for the over-75s and offering ""compensation"" for the so-called Waspi women, could actually increase inequality. This is because pensioners are already ""less likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population"", he said. The SNP has also set out a list of tax-cutting measures - including reducing VAT on e-books, bikes, solar panels and energy efficiency measures and calling for National Insurance thresholds to ""fit devolved income tax rates"" - which Mr Phillips said could mean changes that reduce revenues by billions of pounds across the UK as a whole.He argued that it could therefore have been ""problematic"" for the party to have set out the cost of the measures it was proposing. Mr Phillips said this was because the SNP's own Growth Commission, which examined the finances of an independent Scotland, had already recognised that the country would ""start life with a significant budget deficit"".He said the SNP should be ""commended"" for setting out a plan through the Growth Commission to reduce the budget deficit significantly over the course of a decade.But he said it was ""inconsistent"" to claim that the Growth Commission's plans would not be austerity but at the same time argue that the UK government had been pursuing austerity in recent years.He added: ""Pursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways.""Therefore, in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more, not less, austerity.""Of course, that does not mean Scotland could not afford to be independent, or even that in the longer term better governance and better policymaking as an independent country could mean a stronger economy and more to spend on public services. That is possible - although far from guaranteed.""It just means that an independent Scotland would have to count its pennies and pounds in at least its first decade of life.""Kirsty Blackman, the SNP's deputy Westminster leader and economy spokeswoman, insisted that investment in public services would increase ""year in year out"" after independence, which she said was in ""stark contrast to the brutal austerity that is the hallmark of successive UK governments.""She added: ""The Growth Commission explicitly rejected austerity and instead proposed that Scotland's inherited deficit be reduced by growing the economy, not cutting spending.""The latest Gers figures proves that this is possible. It shows that Scotland's notional deficit fell by 1.1% at the same time as spending increased by 2.5%. This was achieved because growing the economy increases tax receipts.""Brexit is the biggest threat to Scotland's economy and will have a deep and lasting impact on our public services.""But Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said it was clear that ""independence means more not less austerity"", and that the SNP was looking to ""lead Scotland down the road to economic ruin, all for the price of a flag"".Scottish Labour finance spokeswoman Rhoda Grant claimed that the SNP had ""abjectly failed to come up with serious and credible policies"".And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said independence would mean ""at least a decade of new deep cuts at a time when we need to invest in education and boost mental health services"".In analysis published last week, the IFS said it was ""highly likely"" the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto pledges, while Labour would be unable to deliver its promised spending increases.Neither party was therefore being ""honest"" with voters, IFS director Paul Johnson said.The Liberal Democrats' manifesto, he said, would involve lower levels of borrowing than under Labour or the Conservatives, but would still be seen as ""radical"" in ""most periods"".However, he added that, given the uncertainty around Brexit, it was difficult to determine what the exact effects of the three parties' offers would be."
Where are the seats that could turn the election?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50349111,"There are 650 constituencies in the UK but most of the campaigning for the general election will take place in a smaller number. As ever, much of the focus will be on marginal constituencies - places where the winning majority in 2017 was small.However, at this election the parties will also be targeting a large number of constituencies beyond the marginal seats.There will be a lot of focus on areas that voted strongly to Leave or strongly to Remain in the EU referendum - even where the majorities are large. Big swings cannot be ruled out.A striking aspect of the 2017 general election was that the result in lots of constituencies was very close.The normal working definition for a marginal seat is one where the majority is under 10%, which usually means under about 5,000 votes - although that does depend on turnout and the size of the constituency.Then, within that group of seats, there are the ultra-marginals: places where the majority is under 2% - about 1,000 votes.In 2017 there were 51 of these ultra-marginals - considerably more than in previous elections. In fact there were eight seats with a majority under 50.All those will be hotly contested. The Conservatives will be hoping to win back some of the seats they lost last time - like Canterbury, Keighley and Kensington - while Labour will try to take seats where it got within a whisker - such as Arfon, Pudsey and Southampton Itchen. And the Lib Dems will hope to win seats they've previously held like Richmond Park, St Ives and Sheffield Hallam. In Scotland there are 46 marginal seats, using the 10% definition, out of a total of 59. So almost all the constituencies are potentially in play.Of particular interest will be the 21 seats lost by the SNP in 2017. Nearly all voted Remain in the EU referendum so the SNP hopes its anti-Brexit stance will help it to recapture as many of them as possible.In many cases it would only take a small shift - places like Stirling and Gordon, held by the Conservatives, and Rutherglen & Hamilton West and Midlothian, both held by Labour.Another seat to keep an eye on is Fife North East. It's the most marginal constituency in the whole country with an SNP majority over the Liberal Democrats of just two votes. In fact, that's the smallest majority in any seat this century.It's not just Scotland where Brexit will influence which seats are targeted. Strongly Leave and strongly Remain areas are likely to be crucial.The Conservatives are hoping to capture longstanding Labour constituencies that voted heavily to Leave - even those outside the normal marginal range. The map shows that these are concentrated in the Midlands and parts of the north of England - seats like West Bromwich West, Bolsover, and Hyndburn.However, the Brexit Party has a similar goal. It describes Hartlepool as its number one target.On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats are targeting heavily-Remain seats, mostly in the south of England, even though some have quite big majorities. Places like St Albans, Winchester, and Cambridge.Another feature of the Brexit battle at this election is the agreement made by the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party to stand aside for one another in 60 seats across England and Wales.It's impossible to know whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies but it should give a boost to Plaid in places like Llanelli and Ynys Mon and to the Lib Dems in seats including Hazel Grove and Thornbury & Yate.Where parties choose to put up candidates could have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than anywhere else.In Belfast South, for example, Sinn Fein is standing aside in favour of the SDLP to increase its chances of ousting the DUP. The SDLP will return the favour in Belfast North.Meanwhile in Fermanagh & South Tyrone the DUP will stand aside to assist the UUP, as it did in 2017.Another seat to keep an eye on is Foyle where it's a different story. It's the most marginal constituency in Northern Ireland and was a Sinn Fein gain from the SDLP last time. One of the features of recent general elections has been Labour's increasing dominance in London.As a region it used to be fairly representative of the whole country, politically speaking, but over time that has changed. In 2017 Labour won 49 of the 73 seats across the city.There's also evidence that the effect has started to spill out from central London to the outskirts and to constituencies in the surrounding areas.That seems to be linked to an increase in the number of people leaving London - especially those in their 30s and 40s.Labour will be hoping that this demographic change could help it in seats like Chingford & Woodford Green, Crawley, and Milton Keynes South - all popular destinations for people leaving London."
How significant is migration to the UK?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50658968,"In the lead-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, polls suggested immigration was seen as the most pressing issue facing the nation, not EU membership.Today, concern about immigration is far lower, even though many of the underlying factors have not changed.  Whether or not we leave the EU, there are a huge number of unanswered questions over exactly what a reformed immigration system would look like.For almost a decade, the number of migrants coming to the UK was the primary focus of the Conservative Party. David Cameron pledged to push net migration - the balance of people arriving minus those leaving in any one year - below 100,000. He failed. There is no doubt that many who back Brexit hope it will lead to greater control of immigration. But recent immigration statistics clearly show leaving the EU may not affect the overall number of migrants coming to the UK, because of the continuing economic pull the country exerts on the rest of the world. In the year to June 2019, an estimated 212,000 more people moved to the UK than left. Within that total, the number of EU citizens arriving was its lowest level since 2003. At the same time, net migration from the rest of the world has continued to go up and now stands at an estimated 229,000. Migration today is a fundamental part of the British economic landscape, as is the case for every other leading industrialised nation. This narrative is now being adopted by all the main political parties, although it is being packaged in quite different ways. Rather than making promises they will never be able to keep on numbers, all of the political parties are promising control and management. The Conservatives pledge an ""Australian-style points-based system"" which will end freedom of movement.  In essence, this means that someone's chances of getting into the UK comes down to the skills they can offer. The party says this provides ""real control"". The Brexit Party has also pledged to introduce a points-based system, and promised to cut migration to the UK to 50,000, although this figure did not appear in its manifesto.Proposals for a points-based system are not remotely new. It is a rather staggering 14 years since a Labour government first used these words - but the resulting system looks nothing like the Australian model because it has been constantly tinkered with by successive governments. So creating an Australian system would be a massive undertaking and could take years to implement. What's more, the exact shape of this system entirely depends on what happens with Brexit. If the UK stays in the EU, then freedom of movement remains. If we leave, the system could be influenced by the trade deals the UK makes with other countries. For instance, the EU or India may hold out on a deal until the UK offers preferential access to their workers. Labour has not made such an explicit reference to Australia as the Conservatives - but pledges to ""recruit the people we need"". It says that EU freedom of movement may be ""subject to negotiations"".The Conservatives say there will be ""fewer lower-skilled migrants and overall numbers will come down"". But this raises specific questions for specific sectors of the economy. What, for instance, would it mean for social care? There are more than 120,000 vacancies in this increasingly crisis-ridden sector. Most potential workers are not classed as skilled, and the problem is said to be getting worse because the weak pound is putting off many would-be immigrant workers. Labour talks about filling labour shortages. This could mean a very open approach, dictated by business leaders unconcerned about the effect that migration may have on housing and the population. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, explicitly propose taking control of work permits out of the hands of the Home Office and into the Departments for Business and Education. Detractors say this would have the same effect as Labour's policy.Critics say these proposals also raise the prospect that British workers' wages will be undercut. Labour claims it can stop that through regulation and by targeting labour exploitation more effectively. The Conservatives are pledging a suite of measures - some already existing - which aim to ensure migrants pay their way. The current NHS surcharge - paid on entry - will continue, as will another for ""skills"".The party also promises that leaving the EU means European migrants will only be able to access to some key benefits in the way that non-EEA migrants currently do - after five years. It will also stop people claiming child benefit to send to families back home.Labour, the Liberal Democrats and other parties accuse the Conservatives of running a ""hostile environment"" for immigrants who should be made welcome. In particular, Labour and the Lib Dems say migrants should have the right to have their family living with them - which means, among other things, ending a complex minimum income scheme that prevents some spouses coming to the UK. One interesting unanswered question is how the UK counts migrants. At present, the UK is not doing a very good job at doing so, as I have explained elsewhere. The Conservatives say that after Brexit they will track who is coming in and out of the country. However, implementing such a system has not been stopped by the EU, but a combination of technological failures and cuts. The UK once had paper records of migrants, but they were scrapped more than 20 years ago. Tony Blair's Labour then promised an ""e-Borders"" system - but it staggered from crisis to crisis. The Conservative-Lib Dem coalition scrapped that plan in 2010, and to this day there is still no single system in place to count all people in and out. And that perhaps raises the biggest issue. Whatever your view of migration, every expert in this field - from former border officers to academics - says the British immigration system has become a total mess over 20 years: underfunded, blown from crisis to crisis amid competing and contradictory policy objectives and implicitly undermined by a lack of consensus as to what the nation wants.

Ofcom dismisses Tory ice sculpture complaint,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50646185,"Ofcom has decided not to investigate a Conservative Party impartiality complaint about a Channel 4 special.The party complained ahead of the Climate Debate on 28 November about C4's intention to ""empty chair"" the Conservatives with an ice sculpture.It criticised the channel's refusal to accept Cabinet Minister Michael Gove as the Tory representative if the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, didn't attend.But Ofcom concluded the Conservative viewpoint had been given due weight.The one-hour programme went on to ""empty chair"" both Mr Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who was also replaced with an ice sculpture. In a statement, the media watchdog said: ""Ofcom's election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4's use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative's viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight.""The Conservative complaint had described the use of the ice sculpture to replace Mr Johnson as ""a provocative partisan stunt"".But Ofcom said: ""The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the Prime Minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants.""Channel 4 told Ofcom the programme was intended to be a party leaders' debate from the outset.It added that the leaders of the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the co-leader of the Green Party, all agreed to participate in the programme on the understanding it was a leaders' debate.

Labour pledges to cap class sizes at 30 pupils,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50666078,"The Labour Party is promising to cap class sizes at 30 pupils across all schools in England if it wins next week's election.The pledge is an extension of a commitment in its manifesto to limit classes to this size at all primary schools. The party said it would fulfil the pledge by recruiting nearly 20,000 extra teachers over five years. The Conservatives said English schools were rising up international rankings.The party has pledged an extra £14bn over the next three years for schools in England. Labour's pledge to recruit nearly 20,000 teachers is similar to a promise made two weeks ago by the Liberal Democrats. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran accused the party of trying to ""copy"" them, but added that Labour had ""no hope of meeting this target"".She added that Labour would not be able to ""square these promises"" with leaving the EU if voters back the party's Brexit deal in its planned referendum, due to ""thousands of EU teachers coming to work in schools each year"". Labour said the recruitment would be funded from an extra £25bn in schools spending over the next three years. The party has also committed to ensuring all teachers have formal teaching qualifications within five years.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Labour's pledges would ""transform education standards in this country for every child"".""We will invest in record per pupil funding, restore the pupil premium and close the gap in support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, to give every child the support they need,"" she said.She accused the Conservatives of having ""slashed school funding for the first time in a generation, leaving pupils taught by unqualified teachers, crammed in to super-sized classes, and not receiving the support they need"".There is a teacher shortage in England, with the latest official statistics showing a 15% shortfall in numbers beginning training for secondary schools.  But Labour's promise to recruit more may not be easy to deliver.  In subjects such as physics, fewer than half the required graduates have begun to train.  Schools hire teachers, not the government, and it is harder to attract and keep teachers to work in poorer areas. The party also says it would cap all class sizes at 30. At the moment, just over 12% of secondary pupils are taught in classes with between 31-35 pupils. In 2009, when Labour was last in government, it was just over 10%.  While slightly smaller class sizes could appeal to parents, the international evidence suggests it may make less of a difference to results than the quality of teaching. The National Association of Head Teachers said 47,000 secondary teachers and 8,000 primary teachers would be needed by 2024 to keep pace with an expected increase in pupil numbers. Its general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""We need significantly more recruits than Labour are suggesting just to meet rising demand, never mind reduce current class sizes."" ""The new recruits we need will not magically appear, and nor will they stay if we don't also address the stress and unnecessary workload that is widespread in the system.""Schools minister Nick Gibb said that in government Labour would ""would wreck the economy, leaving no money for public services"". He added that figures this week from the OECD's international school rankings showed English schools had risen up the league tables.He added that schools in Wales, where schools are run by the Labour-led devolved government, were the lowest performing within the UK. ""Conservative education reforms are improving standards in our schools, meaning children can get a better start in life,"" he added. Labour are also announcing new plans to tackle homelessness, including £100m a year for emergency winter shelters, £600m to build new hostels, and £200m to refurbish existing ones. In a speech later, shadow housing secretary John Healey will accuse the Conservatives of being ""directly responsible"" for an increase of people living on the streets. A Conservative party spokesman said: ""There is record investment going in to tackling homelessness - £1.2bn until April 2020 with a further £422m for 2020-21."" The Conservatives, like Labour, have pledged to end rough sleeping within five years if elected to government. "
Five key things in the BBC's Johnson-Corbyn debate,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50695308,"This head-to-head debate was touted as the last chance for both leaders to convince the public they are the best man for the job. But after a tumultuous week for both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, did either of them succeed?We will find out for sure on 13 December, but for now, what were the key things from the 60-minute exchange?Let's be honest, it was always going to be a running theme in tonight's debate, wasn't it? For Mr Johnson, his phrase of ""get Brexit done"" was used tens of times  and seemed like his answer to most conundrums.  There were a few awkward moments, though, when he used this tactic - for example, when saying the nastiness in politics that had seen MPs threatened could be ended by his deal. But the PM also got the backing of some audience members for his determination to put the whole issue to bed and move forward with his other priorities.Mr Corbyn faced further scrutiny of Labour's Brexit position - to negotiate a deal with the EU and put it to a referendum - and his own position of staying neutral in any campaign. He was attacked by Mr Johnson for his ""failure of leadership"" by not taking a side, and asked repeatedly about his beliefs. But like the PM, Mr Corbyn won over some of the audience with his pledge to bring the country together, whatever the outcome of another vote on the EU - which he thinks he can achieve as PM by staying neutral.  We have never seen an election where former prime ministers have intervened in quite the way they have this time. Rather than coming out for their successors, the likes of Sir John Major and Tony Blair have been condemning the leaders and questioning whether voters should back them - especially over their positions on Brexit.In question one, we got our audience star in the form of John Purcell, as he asked whether such interventions were ""worrying"" to the party leaders. Or were the elder statesmen, Mr Purcell asked, ""just a couple of old has-beens""?The new kids on the block were polite to their predecessors, though happy to call them wrong.Mr Johnson said he had the ""utmost respect for all former Conservative leaders"" ""but I don't think [Sir John] is right"". Instead he repeated that the Tories had an ""oven-ready plan"" for Brexit, and it would lead to a stronger future for the UK. For Mr Corbyn, both Mr Blair and Sir John were ""welcome to make their comments"". But he ""urged them to think for a moment of the reality of nine years of austerity"" under the Tories before they cast their vote. A quick question emailed by a far-flung audience member really got to the core of the difference between a vote for Mr Johnson and one for Mr Corbyn. Which of the philosophies - socialism or capitalism - had helped the poor the most, the absent questioner asked? The Labour leader went first, ""Socialism, carried out in a democratic way, in this country, Scandinavia and elsewhere, has raised the living standards"", he said, citing the post-war Labour government which created the NHS. His rival then made the argument for capitalism, saying his ""One Nation Conservatism"" understood that having a ""dynamic market economy was the only way in which you can pay for fantastic public services"". And that, he said, offered the ""balance and symmetry"" needed. But Mr Johnson then went on to condemn his opposite's position, accusing Labour of wanting to ""overthrow capitalism"", and calling such an attack on it ""absolutely senseless"".Mr Corbyn, however, replied: ""My kind of socialism is one where you don't leave people behind"". He then accused the Tories of allowing inequality to grow. We can't see either leader swapping sides anytime soon. There was a titter from the audience when the two leaders were asked what punishment they deemed suitable for lying during political campaigns. Mr Johnson, to further audience giggles, called for such fibbers to be ""made to go on their knees through the chamber of the House of Commons"". He then turned his phrase to poke fun at some of Mr Corbyn's revelations, saying such politicians should be ""scourging themselves with copies of offending documents that claim to prove one thing and prove something different"".Mr Corbyn took a straighter approach to his answer, saying he wanted a ""stronger, not weaker House of Commons to hold the government to account"" - and hopefully one led by him. But he did get a hit back at Boris Johnson, saying there should be independent monitoring to ""test statements on the side of a bus"" for their validity. Some of these debates have become a little rowdy in the run-up to the December poll as emotions have run high. This final head-to-head avoided the boos the leaders had sometimes encountered in the campaign, and remained calm. But it did raise applause. It wasn't only their policies that got the claps going though - such as the regular promise to get Brexit done, by Mr Johnson, and repeated pledges for the NHS by Mr Corbyn . It was the jibes. Mr Johnson laid into his counterpart on a number of occasions, accusing him of supporting the IRA, wanting to ""break up the union"" and ""failure to take a stand"" over Brexit.But the Labour leader had his comebacks, and called for the PM to ""show a degree of honesty"" in his answers. The audience seemed to enjoy the bit of spice it added to the proceedings. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. "
What does 'Get Brexit done' mean?,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50222315,"The Conservative slogan ""Get Brexit done"" suggests a quick and easy path to leaving the European Union (EU), allowing the UK to focus on other things apart from Brexit. But it's not that simple.We know the Brexit deadline has been delayed again - this time until 31 January 2020.If the Conservatives win a clear majority in this election, Brexit day could be earlier than that, otherwise it could be delayed again.Either way, though, it won't be the end of the matter. Boris Johnson wants it to happen as soon as possible.""It is fair to say you're getting Brexit done because you are coming out of the EU and you're coming out of the legal order of the EU,"" the prime minister told the BBC.""You are really taking back control of all the things - money, border, rules - you are doing all that.""But while the day of Brexit would certainly be a big symbolic moment (loved and hated in equal measure), it would also leave an enormous amount unresolved.That's because Brexit is not really a single event - it's a complex process that will go on for years.The UK would no longer be a member state of the European Union. That would be a significant change. But - and this assumes the UK left with a withdrawal agreement - only a few issues would actually have been sorted out. Among other things:Almost everything else would still be up for grabs. Brexit would not be done. The legally binding deal we're talking about at the moment covers only the divorce, not the future relationship.That is dealt with in an accompanying political declaration, which is non-binding and sets only a direction of travel. A future government could still change course.  Initially, the UK would enter a transition period during which it would continue to follow all EU rules and regulations and continue to pay the same amount of money into the EU budget.The transition would be due to end in December 2020, but under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it could be extended by one or two years.The government, though, has now said it will not ask for any extension. The advantage of transition is it would be a soft landing. There would be no sudden changes to the way the economy works, which would give some certainty to businesses. And there would be time to start negotiating the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU.But for as long as it lasts, the UK would have to follow all the rules policed by the European Commission, and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, without having any say in making those rules.There is a lot we need to talk about. What kind of free-trade arrangements would be put in place? What kind of security and police cooperation would be negotiated with the EU? How would data be exchanged in the future? It usually takes years to negotiate a free-trade deal but the UK and the EU would initially have a matter of months. The withdrawal agreement says the two sides would have to decide by 1 July 2020 whether to extend the post-Brexit transition period. So if the UK was to leave on 31 January, at the end of the current extension, there would be exactly five months to negotiate a trade deal. That's not enough, not even close.It's true the two sides would start from the same place (with all the same rules and regulations). But it's also true this would be the first trade deal in history when two parties were trying to move further away from each other rather than closer together.  Trade negotiations are not for the faint-hearted - naturally enough, everyone is looking after their own interests. Some sectors of the economy would do well but others with less political clout might suffer. The fishing industry (which represents only about 0.1% of the UK economy) is fearful of this because it knows trade deals involve trade-offs. One other thing: as well as negotiating with the EU, the UK would also need to sign up to a series of trade agreements round the world to replace those it has as part of the EU. All of that could take up most of the next decade. It won't be done when the UK leaves the EU - it will only just have begun. If the UK were to leave with no withdrawal agreement, of course, there would be no transition period. Supporters of no-deal call it a clean break - we've looked at what that would entail here.The UK would certainly be free of EU rules and regulations straight away. But it would be a sudden jolt that government forecasts and the vast majority of independent economists say would do serious damage to the economy. All those negotiations about the future would still have to take place but they would do so in a much less harmonious political atmosphere. And if the government sticks with its pledge to rule out any extension to the transition period, its opponents fear a new kind of no-deal could happen at the end of next year - ending the transition without any free trade deal in place.  Talking of harmony, part of the government's ""Get Brexit done,"" argument is it would help heal the divisions in society that have emerged since the Brexit referendum.But many people are opposed to the government's proposed Brexit deal. Those who support remaining in the EU would continue to campaign for another referendum - a final say before Brexit happens. And if they were to fail, they could transform their campaign into a movement to try to rejoin. On the other side of the argument, those who favour a clean break could continue to argue that the compromises the government has had to make to come to an agreement with the EU amount to a betrayal of their Brexit vision. Leave and Remain has become a more important dividing line in many ways than UK party politics and it doesn't feel like that will suddenly come to an end. Whatever happens in the next few months, the fallout from the Brexit referendum will remain with us for years to come.     What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

PM hails Nato 'solidarity' after anniversary talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50653296,"Boris Johnson has hailed Nato as ""the most successful alliance in history"" after talks with leaders near London. The PM insisted there was ""very great solidarity"" within the alliance, amid tensions on its 70th anniversary. He also praised the role of the United States, adding the country had been a ""pillar of stability"" on security issues. Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to ensure Nato focused on reducing ""tensions around the world"". Leaders of the 29-member military alliance have been discussing shared security issues at a special meeting to mark 70 years since its formation. In a statement issued after talks at a luxury resort near Watford, leaders acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism.On Tuesday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries in the alliance had added $130bn (£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised how much other allies spend on defence.Speaking to reporters at a press conference afterwards, Mr Johnson said member countries were making ""real progress"" towards meeting a target to spend 2% or more of their economic output on defence.Asked whether President Trump was good for the UK, the prime minister said the US had always ""should shoulder to shoulder"" with the country.He added that the country's response after the Salisbury poisonings last year had been a ""fantastic testament to the transatlantic alliance"".Pressed directly to comment on Mr Trump as a leader, Mr Johnson said the administration he leads ""could not have been more supportive"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party was committed to remaining part of the Nato alliance, adding it was ""important to be part of"".""I think we'll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance, principally through the United Nations,"" he added. Although Labour's manifesto pledges to maintain the UK's commitment to Nato, Mr Johnson accused Labour of wanting to ""destroy"" it. Mr Corbyn has previously attacked the organisation ""as a danger to peace"", but on Wednesday said: ""We have decided we'll remain in Nato as a party, and that's it.""He added that he thought Nato was going in the ""wrong"" direction back in 2011, but the alliance has since ""changed its focus"". On Tuesday evening, leaders attended receptions at Downing Street and at Buckingham Palace.The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism at No 10.He had faced questions over whether he was avoiding a one-to-one meeting with Mr Trump, over concerns it could blow his election campaign off course, but Downing Street said the two men had a low-key, off camera meeting.On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he had not talked about the NHS during the meeting, but did talk about ""all manner of areas of cooperation, from Nato to Syria to trade"". Labour has claimed throughout the election campaign that the future of the health service could be threatened by a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.  Later in the evening, Mr Johnson was filmed chatting with a group of leaders during a reception at Buckingham Palace - they appeared to be discussing the US president.Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest he did not take Donald Trump seriously after the video emerged.President Trump has cancelled a planned press conference, telling reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who said he intended to ask the US president for ""reassurances"" that the NHS would be ""off the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks - was also at the reception, but says he did not have an opportunity to speak to him.Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Mr Trump had said he wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, adding he would not touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"".Asked whether he could work with Mr Corbyn as prime minister, he said he could ""work with anybody"", although earlier he said he thought Mr Johnson would do a ""good job""."
Exit polls explained: How accurate are they?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50716626,"As the polls closed at 22:00 GMT on Thursday night, the UK had its first real indication of the general election result with an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky News. The survey taken at UK polling stations suggested that the Conservatives would get 368 MPs - 50 more than at the 2017 election - when all the results have been counted.The exit poll is a survey of thousands of voters just after they have cast their ballot. It covers England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland, where a different set of parties dominate politics. The exit poll is based on 144 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales. The constituencies are chosen to be demographically representative of the country, balanced between rural and urban seats, and weighted slightly in favour of marginal areas. The same constituencies are surveyed from one election to the next, for consistency. But there are a number of exceptions to this rule: if a seat disappears from the electoral map because of boundary changes, for example, or if the seat is held by the Speaker, whose election is traditionally not contested by other parties. Exit pollsters base themselves at a selected polling station in a chosen constituency. Voters emerging from the polling station are waylaid at regular intervals - every 10th voter, for example - by these fieldworkers, employed by polling specialists Ipsos Mori. They are given a replica ballot paper and asked to fill it in without anyone watching. They then drop the replica paper into a box that will be opened later. Crucially, they do not have to say out loud how they voted - the idea is this increases the accuracy of the results, says Stephen Fisher, associate professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford. The results are then analysed by a team of experts at a secret location in London.It has been becoming more accurate as the methodology improves. The rough rule of thumb is an exit poll that comes within 15 seats of the final outcome is considered accurate, Prof Fisher says. The 2015 exit poll was more accurate than the opinion polls during the campaign but did not predict a Conservative majority.In 2017, the first take of the exit poll correctly predicted the Conservatives would be the largest party, but stopped short of saying there would be a hung Parliament. One of the worst misfires was in 1992, when two separate exit polls, for the BBC and ITN, both predicted a hung Parliament. Instead, John Major's Conservative government held its position, albeit with a significantly reduced majority.The first result from the 2019 exit poll will not cover the last half hour or so of voting. If there's a late rush of voters that could change the result, the exit poll could be updated with a new headline after about 23:00 GMT. They are not included directly but the analysts do consider any evidence the changes among postal voters in the polls are different from those among in-person voters, Prof Fisher says. It may take some time for the full picture to emerge but if there's a strong trend, the first seats to declare, traditionally in the north-east of England, will confirm the exit poll's prediction - or not. The only way to find out is to be watching on Thursday night. "
How likely is Boris Johnson to lose his seat?,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-50570468,"A battle is raging in a commuter town on the outskirts of London to unseat Boris Johnson - a prime minister defending the smallest constituency majority for nearly 100 years. A carnival floods the streets of Uxbridge. With glitter on their faces, a sea of young people follow a red Routemaster. Loud music booms from the open-top bus.Despite the rain, residents dance along with the parade as it snakes through the west London suburb, which lies 17 miles from the Houses of Parliament. Others watch with disgust as the group's occasionally lewd banners pass by. One of the less offensive reads: #KickBorisOut. Flyers are thrust into the hands of bystanders, urging them to register to vote. The rally is run by an anti-Tory group which says people here are fed up with an MP who is a ""power-hungry Eton boy who lives in a million-pound house on the other side of London"". That MP happens also to be the prime minister. But could Boris Johnson actually face defeat in Uxbridge and South Ruislip? Last month, election modelling by YouGov estimated Mr Johnson was on course to win his seat comfortably. Yet a member of the protest group was undeterred. ""From what we're seeing, he should be worried.""The A40 splits Uxbridge and South Ruislip in half. Depending on which side of the road you live could mean an eight-year gap in your life expectancy. Voters living in Eastcote, in the affluent north of the borough, can expect to reach 84 years of age. Those living in Botwell, in the poorer southern tip, tend to make it just past 76. The south of the constituency is dominated by a large student population, centred on Brunel University. And this commuter-belt corner of London, 15 miles or so from Parliament itself, has a large, affluent immigrant population, mostly of South Asian heritage. The streets here are lined with independent shops and market stalls. An entrepreneurial spirit runs through the town, and two major infrastructure projects bear down on it - both of which could influence the election here. The first phase of the HS2 high-speed railway passes through Ruislip. But a bigger issue looms overhead. Heathrow airport is in the next-door constituency, where a third runway is expected to bring an extra 730 flights a day. Mr Johnson is seen as particularly vulnerable over Heathrow. Before reaching government he was a vocal critic of the airport's expansion. As mayor of London he vowed to ""lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the... runway"". Yet, as an MP, he was a notably absent in June 2018 when Parliament voted for the project. Last month, Greenpeace protesters gave him the chance to fulfil his promise, parking a bulldozer outside Uxbridge Tube station. It could be an important factor here. In 2017, Boris Johnson won the seat with a majority of 5,034. It was the smallest majority of any sitting prime minister since 1924 and is the 181st-slimmest majority out of 650 seats. It was also the 69th most marginal Tory seat. Given who the MP is, Uxbridge and South Ruislip has become one of the most high-profile contests of the election.56.4%Leave43.6% RemainMany residents look back fondly on Mr Johnson's eight years as mayor of London. Justify Salon in Ruislip Manor, was one of many businesses in the area that benefited from grants handed out during Mr Johnson's time in City Hall. Owner Justine McKenna still keeps a photo of her and Mr Johnson in the salon. But she's losing faith. ""He's not around very much since he became an MP. It leaves him at risk,"" she says. ""I don't think he's doing a lot for small business any more."" She says ""a lot of people are looking at Jo Swinson"", the Liberal Democrat leader.Both Shan Baker and her husband Phil are considering not voting Conservative for the first time.""We don't like him as a man,"" says Mrs Baker, who runs a market stall in Uxbridge town centre.""We were very supportive of him. We thought he was a good mayor, but he's turned out to be very self-serving as an MP,"" Mr Baker adds. ""He's got all these Brexiteers in the cabinet and I think they're not very nice people. The Tory party has moved quite a lot to the right, and we like our centrists.""Brexit will be a factor here. In 2016, Hillingdon, the London borough that includes Uxbridge and South Ruislip, voted 56% in favour of leaving the European Union. It was one of only four London boroughs to vote Leave.There is a definite weariness among voters after three years of Brexit debate. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Joanne Humphreys, is hoping to offer a compelling Remain option in the seat of the nation's most prominent Brexiteer. But this still feels like Brexit country. The idea of cancelling Brexit, or running another referendum horrifies some.Jamie Follett, a market stall holder in Uxbridge, says he will be voting Conservative until ""Brexit is sorted"".  ""It doesn't matter how I voted. The fact is we voted, and there has been an outcome and you have to deliver on it.""Mr Follett likes the prime minister's energy. Even the recent legal troubles over Mr Johnson's attempt to suspend Parliament for five weeks ""shows he is trying to be different"". ""I know it was wrong, but I appreciated it,"" Mr Follett says. ""We need someone strong to just get us through. In general people like me would vote Labour but I need Conservatives to stay in, at least for a little bit, to keep it nice and steady.""Mr Johnson's personal brand has definitely won him fans. ""We're not just going to support Boris, we are going to campaign for him,"" says Asif Meer, owner of a motor mechanics garage in the nearby area of Yiewsley.He recounts how one meeting with the PM turned Mr Meer from a Labour voter into a passionate ""team Boris"" supporter. He had previously been upset by Mr Johnson's comments about women in burkas ""looking like letter boxes"". ""When I met him he explained he doesn't mean it that way,"" he says. ""I like him as a person. It's a personality rather than the national issues. He's a good guy.""Despite the high stakes, the local Conservatives' campaign will not change too much from previous years. ""We don't sense a feeling for change,"" says the Conservative leader of Hillingdon Council, Ray Puddifoot.Seasoned local activists continue the same door-knocking routes and advertising campaigns they did at the last election. These are the tactics that have helped Mr Puddifoot lead a Conservative majority on the council for 20 years. All the councillors in Mr Johnson's corner of the borough are Conservatives. ""We're taking nothing for granted but I think it's looking good at the moment,"" Mr Puddifoot says.It is unclear how much time Mr Johnson has spent here during the campaign.Despite repeated questioning the Conservatives were unable to say how often their candidate had visited the area. The first local hustings was cancelled as it clashed with a TV leaders' debate. At a hastily re-organised debate, held in Yiewsley on Thursday night, Mr Johnson failed to show.But even without visiting, Mr Johnson's presence looms large.Most people here have a story of meeting Mr Johnson, or a child who has accepted a school award from him.But political groups from across the spectrum can smell blood. A huge door-to-door campaign is under way, with Labour activists trying to capture floating voters.""We've definitely noticed a shift towards Labour,"" says the party's candidate, Ali Milani. ""This election will be won on local issues,"" he says. ""People can have a conversation with me and bring up a local school or a local hospital and I've used those services. Everyone says to me that we should be worried because Mr Johnson is a much better campaigner than Theresa May, but that's not what I've seen.""Momentum, the pro-Jeremy Corbyn grassroots group, has dispatched thousands of activists to the area. ""This is going to be a good turnout battle,"" Laura Parker, Momentum's national co-ordinator, says. ""It is doable. It's not fantasyland because we fancied doing a stunt.""I'm old enough to remember the Portillo moment,"" she says, referencing the defeat of the then Tory cabinet minister Michael Portillo in 1997. ""And oh, what joy that was. This would be even bigger.""The student vote could also prove  important. Brunel University has a population of nearly 10,000 potential voters. Students have the option of voting in the home constituency or registering to vote at university. ""I've registered to vote here because I want to vote Boris out,"" says Ellie Hiatt, a Brunel student. ""Everyone's registered to vote here.""Fellow student Rebecca Stone adds: ""I'm not going to be at home for the election. Uxbridge is a marginal."" Yet neither is sure exactly who will get their vote.No prime minister has ever lost their seat. If the Conservatives win the general election but Mr Johnson loses his seat, constitutionally the country would be in uncharted waters. He could remain prime minister while attempting to rejoin Parliament. A supportive Tory MP in a safe seat could be asked to make way, leading to a by-election. But there would be intense political pressure for Mr Johnson to step down.Taking down the prime minister would be the ultimate scalp. With so much at stake, neither side is backing down. Labour's Mr Milani says Uxbridge and South Ruislip has ""become the battleground of the country"". And by the early hours of 13 December, voters here might ultimately have decided which person gets the keys to Downing Street.Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues, such as Brexit, education and the NHS. "
10 reasons why we're not a divided nation,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49762140,"Much of the talk since the Brexit referendum has been of a nation divided, split by geography, income, education and age.But despite the Remainer v Leaver rhetoric, most people in the UK actually appear to agree on a wide variety of subjects, and share an increasingly socially liberal outlook.Here are 10 subjects that unite most of us in Britain, according to recent polling.Almost all of us Britons - 99% - feel ""some"" or ""significant"" responsibility to be faithful to our partners, a ComRes survey for BBC News suggests. Women appear more likely to feel significant responsibility than men - of those surveyed, 86% of women felt significant responsibility, compared with 79% of the men.Among the men surveyed, those in older age brackets were more likely to feel significant responsibility than those in younger groups. Some 87% of the men over the age of 55 felt this level of responsibility, compared with 66% of those aged 16-24.There is almost universal support for the principle of equal pay between men and women, the annual British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey suggests.Of those surveyed, about nine in 10 of us (89%) said it was wrong for men to be paid more than women doing the same job in the same company.There were differences in the strength of opinion between men and women, however, with 78% of the women surveyed considering this pay inequality ""very wrong"", compared with 57% of the men. Three-quarters of Britons reject the idea women should be ""homemakers"" and men should be ""breadwinners"", according to BSA data.Not only did those surveyed see women as having a role outside the home, they were also unlikely to see particular roles as being men's or women's work. Most of us also think men and women are mostly equally suited to working in a wide range of roles, including doctor, councillor and MP, the BSA survey suggests.About half said men and women were ""equally suited"" to ""all"" or ""almost all jobs"", with a further third saying men and women were equally suited to ""most jobs"". Four in 10 said a mother should take most of a parental leave period, with the father taking some. A third said it should be shared equally between both parents.Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of Natcen Social Research, which carries out the British Social Attitudes survey, says the shifts in attitudes towards women's roles and rights, as well as sexual relationships, are one of the ""most striking stories"" seen in the survey over the past few decades.And while it may appear politically divided right now, particularly around Brexit, the country remains ""very, very united"" on a number of social issues. ""On all of those kinds of things we've become increasingly socially liberal,"" she says. ""This is very different from the US, where alongside very political divides, you see what you might describe as a 'culture war' - we don't see that at all in our data.""Such trends are longstanding and researchers expect them to continue, she adds, suggesting Britons will continue to agree on some of the fundamental social issues in the UK.Two-thirds of Britons say sex between two adults of the same sex is ""not wrong at all"", according to the BSA survey, an increase of almost 50% since the question was first asked, in 1983.It suggests approval for same-sex relationships has risen steadily after a fall in the mid-1980s - the time of the Aids crisis and the government's ""Don't die of ignorance,"" campaign.According to the BSA researchers, this rise is not just down to a generational change: older people too have become more liberal in their views, and so have those who do not follow a religion.However, the BSA survey does note the liberalisation in attitudes to sexual relationships appears to be slowing down.The proportion of respondents stating sexual relations between two adults of the same sex are ""not wrong at all"" has remained at about two-thirds (64%, 68% and 66%) for the past three years.Researchers say this suggests a significant minority of people remain uncomfortable with same-sex relationships. This is, perhaps, ""reflecting the marked divides between the attitudes of religious and non-religious people"", they say.There is near unanimous support (92% in 2016) for abortions when a woman's health is in danger, according to the BSA survey. And since 2005, support for allowing an abortion if the woman does not wish to have a child has increased from 60 to 69%. More than eight in 10 Britons trust university scientists ""to do their work with the intention of benefitting the public"" and 67% trust company scientists to do the same, according to the BSA survey.An even higher percentage - 94% - believe medical research in particular will ""lead to an improvement in the quality of life"" over the coming decades. Graduates and those in managerial and professional occupations have a particularly high level of trust in university scientists at 90%, compared with 73% of those with no qualifications. There is little evidence of a ""disenfranchised population turning against the institutions of science"", BSA researchers say, despite popular accounts of declining trust in ""experts"".Almost eight in 10 people (77%) believe the NHS is crucial to British society, according to a survey by Ipsos Mori for the King's Fund think-tank.This support has remained constant through changes in government and fluctuations in the economy.About 90% also support the NHS's three founding principles - that it should be free at the point of delivery; provide a comprehensive service available to everyone; and be primarily funded through taxation. Perhaps more surprisingly, two-thirds are also prepared to pay more tax to maintain the level of spending needed to keep the NHS going.However, satisfaction with the service appears to be dropping, according to the British Social Attitudes Survey. Overall satisfaction was 53% in 2018 - a three percentage point drop from the previous year and the lowest level since 2007.More than seven in 10 Britons believe it is ""very"" or ""quite important"" for the country to continue to have a monarchy, according to the BSA survey.However, the size of this majority did shrink significantly between the 1980s and 1990s, before growing again in the 2000s.In 1983, more than 86% were in favour of the monarchy. But this figure fell to 66% in 1994 - around the time of the Prince of Wales' separation from Diana, Princess of Wales, and ahead of her death in a car accident, in 1997.But public opinion rose again following a low in 2003, to reach 76% in 2012 - the year of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.Britain has marked a number of other royal milestones in the past few years: the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding, in 2011, and that of the the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in 2018, as well as a number of royal births.As many as 95% of Britons think climate change is at least partly due to human activity, according to the 2018 European Social Survey (the European sister of the BSA).Some 36% say it is ""mainly"" or ""entirely"" due to human activity, while 53% think human and natural causes are equally to blame. Just 2% say climate change ""definitely is not happening"". When it comes to things - rather than social views - celebrities, charities and food dominate the collective most-loved list, according to YouGov.David Attenborough comes top, with a massive 87% approval, its polling suggests.And he is followed on its most-popular-things list by a number of health charities, including the St John Ambulance Brigade (87%) and Macmillan Cancer Support (86%) and actor Tom Hanks (84%).Overall, 19 of the top 100 entries are charities. A quarter are people - mainly actors - and a quarter are foods.A study by Dr Paul Hanel, research associate at Bath University's department of psychology, suggests those on either side of the Brexit argument actually agree on a wide range of subjects.His research indicates the views of Leavers and Remainers are actually 90% similar across a number of topics, including poverty, climate change, housing, British identity, life satisfaction, the importance of involvement in communities.Even on subjects viewed as the most divisive, such as attitudes to immigrants and national identity, the two groups showed more than 50% similarity, Dr Hanel says.He says a focus on ""differences"" means we overstate the gap between Leavers and Remainers, and that the evidence that they have more in common may help heal the wounds caused by the Brexit debate.""Its easier to talk to someone else if there are more similarities between you than you might expect,"" , Mr Hanel says.Design by Mark Bryson, Joy Roxas and Sana Jasemi."
Who are the Scots who won't vote in the election?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50658588,"About a third of the record four million people across Scotland who are registered to vote in next Thursday's general election are not expected to do so.Many simply won't get round to voting this time, while others have never voted.But with disillusionment with politics and politicians said to be on the rise, some say they no longer want to endorse what they claim is a broken system.Clair Ellis, from Armadale in West Lothian, has been unemployed, homeless and a single parent at different points in her life.The 37-year-old says those experiences shaped her view that politics is a ""circus"" that does little to actually improve people's lives - and that politicians with ""lavish lifestyles"" are out of touch with the struggles faced by many of their constituents. Ms Ellis believes many promises the parties make before elections are little more than attempts to bribe voters, and that they will ""hardly ever come to pass"".And she argues that the failure to deliver Brexit more than three years after the referendum shows that the electorate have ""no control"" and that votes can be ""overturned at the drop of a hat"". For her, not voting has therefore become a deliberate choice, a political act in itself, rather than apathy. Ms Ellis said: ""I think the very act of voting now is only to give us the sense that we have some sort of control. In the end they all just do what they want.""A lot of people say women died for our right [to vote]. I don't doubt it - but they died in vain if you ask me."" Carly Frame, 32, has always voted in the past - although she says she has never been committed to a single party - but says she has already decided not to this time. ""I don't think there's a difference between any of the parties now, they're all as bad as one another"", she insists. ""They don't care about the public. No matter who you vote for it's going to be wasted - particularly in Westminster under first-past-the-post."" Her view of politics has also been soured by the Brexit process, which she believes has left politicians of all parties ignoring the day-to-day issues that are actually important to people, like the NHS and the environment.And she believes politicians will ""just keeping holding election or referendums"" until they get the result they want. Ms Frame, from Hamilton, says: ""I feel my vote stands for nothing because I voted for Brexit and I voted [for Scotland] to remain in the UK.""If either referendum result had gone different, I wouldn't be out campaigning for a new referendum because it didn't go my way.  I'm sick of politicians trying to derail the results.""Recent research by the BBC showed that the number of non-voters was greater than the sitting MP's majority in 551 out of the 650 constituencies at last election in 2017. In other words, the result of the election could potentially have been very different indeed if everyone had turned up.Of the 10 seats across the UK with the lowest turnouts, four were in Glasgow - including Glasgow North East, which was the lowest of all at just 53%.And with many seats in Scotland won by a few hundred votes or less - and one by only two votes - the last time, it can genuinely be said that every vote could count on 12 December.For Rachael Farrington, this suggests that the best way to bring about change is to turn up and vote - even if your preferred candidate has no realistic chance of winning.She set up the Voting Counts campaign when she was at school after discovering that her friends didn't plan to vote. And she believes that voting for a candidate who doesn't win will still put pressure on the winning candidate to take notice of your concerns, adding: ""If you don't have your voice heard someone else's will be so don't let other people make those decisions for you"".  Even if you can't bring yourself to vote for any of the parties or candidates, she argues, it is better to spoil your ballot rather than stay at home because it will ""show a difference between disaffection with the choice available and disinterest"".Willie Sullivan, of the Electoral Reform Society, agrees that many people don't think the political system works for them, and have effectively decided to opt-out. He says some non-voters believe that taking part in the election will give legitimacy to a political system they believe is broken. Turnout at general elections has been lower in recent elections than it has been at any point since the end of World War Two.And Mr Sullivan believes big changes are needed if that trend is to be reversed - including more proportional electoral system, the replacement of the House of Lords with an elected second chamber and the decentralising of power away from Westminster. He also says government policies are often specifically targeted at swing voters and marginal constituencies - which can lead parties to take their traditional heartlands for granted. Mr Sullivan added: ""This disengagement and alienation is about a lack of power. Non-voters are not going to endorse a system that perpetuates that.""What are your questions about the general election?

When do we find out who has won the election?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50672511,"The polls have closed and election night is upon us which, for some at least, means a night of strong cups of coffee, swingometers and a battle to stay awake.There are 650 seats in the House of Commons up for grabs, meaning the winning party needs 326 to claim a majority.But how long will it be before we know who's won, and what the next government could look like? Here's an hour-by-hour guide to what to look out for and when. What to look for: Who is the fastest to declare?As the exit poll is announced, expect the main parties to spend the hour saying things like, ""it's early days"", ""the polls have been wrong before"", and ""we're not counting our chickens yet"". But rest assured they'll be watching. The exit poll (you can read more it here) has proved to be very accurate in recent years. In 2017 it caused jaws to drop by forecasting the Conservatives wouldn't earn a majority. In 2015, when all the talk was of a hung Parliament, it forecast a Conservative majority. In the absence of any actual news, there will be a flurry of analysis in this first hour as political experts (who will have been bound by broadcast rules for election day) can finally tell you what the parties have been saying to them during the day.And we should also get one actual result after about an hour. Or more likely we'll get two. Counters in the rival Labour seats of Newcastle upon Tyne Central and Houghton and Sunderland South will race (literally race) to be the first to declare. In 2017, Newcastle Central declared first, at 23:01, followed by Houghton and Sunderland South nine minutes later. What to look for: Is Labour's ""red wall"" crumbling?After that initial excitement, there might be a bit of a lull as results start to trickle in. Expect the early chat to be about Labour in the north-east of England, as places like Halton, Washington & Sunderland West and Newcastle upon Tyne East will declare early. Experts have talked about Labour's ""red wall"". These are traditionally Labour seats in north-east Wales, the Midlands and the north of England that voted in favour of Brexit. They're seen as key targets for the pro-Brexit Conservatives. One early seat to look out for is Workington (remember all that talk of Workington man?), which is likely to declare shortly before 01:00. Labour has held the seat for 40 years, yet 61% of people there voted Leave. Has the ""get Brexit done"" Tory message cut through?What to look for: Are the Tories winning in places like Wrexham?Things should begin to speed up a little bit. Look out for the result in Labour's Darlington, which will declare at about 01:30. The Tories have targeted it. And if it's going to be a good night for Labour, they might hope to take Swindon South off Justice Secretary Robert Buckland (he has a 2% majority). And Hartlepool could be interesting: Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice is standing there.The Tories will hope to win Vale of Clwyd and Wrexham, which form the western end of that ""red wall"" we mentioned above. Meanwhile, in London, Justine Greening's former seat of Putney is up for grabs. Labour is eyeing it. And if it's a three-way, winner-takes-all, battle royal you're after, you're in luck. Just 360 votes separated the SNP (who came first), the Conservatives (second) and Labour (third) in Lanark & Hamilton East last time. There could be fireworks when it declares at about 01:30.What to look for: Was Iain Duncan Smith the first big casualty?Key Conservative targets including Labour's Stockton South (1% majority) and Great Grimsby are likely to declare before 03:00. And Caroline Flint's seat of Don Valley could also be vulnerable to the Tories. Watch out for those.Labour is aiming for Alun Cairns's seat of Vale of Glamorgan and will be looking for a big scalp in the shape of Iain Duncan Smith, in Chingford and Woodford Green. The prominent Brexiteer and former Tory leader has a 2,438 (5.2%) majority.We should also get a sense of how the Lib Dems' night is going. They expect to win St Albans but it is unclear how successful ex-Labour MP Chuka Umunna will be in Cities of London and Westminster. Also watch out for Sheffield Hallam, where Labour's Jared O'Mara is standing down - that's Nick Clegg's old seat. Leader Jo Swinson's seat of Dunbartonshire East is also expected to declare about now. Her majority is just over 5,000.Labour shadow Scotland secretary Lesley Laird could lose her Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat and Dartford, a bellwether seat that flip-flops between the Conservatives and Labour, should declare at about 03:00. That could be interesting. At about the same time Islington North, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's seat, should announce its result.What to look for: Beast of Bols-over - did Dennis Skinner lose?Watch for a Lib Dem win in Devon North as it could spell trouble for the Conservatives in the South West. The Lib Dems are also eyeing a cabinet scalp in the shape of Dominic Raab. His Esher and Walton seat has returned Tory MPs for 100 years, but Remain-supporting voters could make it vulnerable for the party.It is worth watching if Labour firebrand Dennis Skinner loses Bolsover to the Conservatives after almost 50 years. John Mann's former Labour seat of Bassetlaw could turn blue. The same might happen in Ashfield, while Canterbury might also go back to the Conservatives - Rosie Duffield has a majority of just 187.Having defected from Labour and leaving her Liverpool Wavertree constituency, Luciana Berger is hoping to win Finchley and Golders Green. Another Lib Dem convert - Sam Gyimah - could be part of a three-way marginal in Kensington (if he's lucky)And two results are due from Belfast just after 03:00. In Belfast South, Sinn Fein is standing aside in an attempt to help the SDLP oust the DUP. The SDLP is returning the favour in Belfast North. About an hour later we should also hear from Fermanagh & South Tyrone where the UUP will hope the DUP's decision not to stand again helps them beat Sinn Fein.What to look for: Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and of course Boris JohnsonHundreds of results will be in. But there's still more to come. Can ex-Tory Dominic Grieve win Beaconsfield as an independent? And can fellow ex-Tory Anna Soubry win Broxtowe, or will she just open the door to a Labour gain? We should find out about now.Stoke-on-Trent North and Stoke-on-Trent Central are both Brexit-supporting Labour seats under threat from the Conservatives. And Labour targets Milton Keynes South and Hastings and Rye are worth watching.Labour is also targeting Loughborough, the former seat of ex-minister Nicky Morgan, who has stood down.Finally, will Boris Johnson be slightly nervous in Uxbridge and South Ruislip? He has the smallest majority of any sitting prime minister for 100 years. We'll find out if he wins at about 04:30.What to look for: Recounts, concessions and victory speeches Most counts will be completed by 06:00. But there could still be time to watch a big beast face defeat. One of Labour's best chances of a significant scalp is beating Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers in Chipping Barnet. Independent Claire Wright has high hopes in Devon East, having come second last time and if the Lib Dems have made little progress so far, they should at least expect to win Richmond Park. Zac Goldsmith won the seat last time by just 45 votes. That should be about it. And if you've made it to 07:00, congratulations."
Early gains for SNP as exit poll predicts 55 seats,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766014,"The SNP could be on course to win 55 of the 59 seats in Scotland, according to an exit poll published as voting ended in the UK general election. If the forecast is correct, it would see the SNP win 20 more seats than the 35 it won in 2017.The poll, carried out on behalf of the BBC, ITV and Sky News, also suggests the Conservatives could win 368 seats, Labour 191 and the Lib Dems 13.That would mean the Conservatives would have an overall majority of 86. The first general election results have already started to come in, with Newcastle Central the first constituency in the UK to declare. The final total expected to be known by Friday lunchtime.The predicted result would be a remarkable success for the SNP, and would see the party return a similar number of MPs to the historic 56 it won in the 2015 general election.It would also potentially add weight to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's demands for a second independence referendum, which she wants to hold next year. Exit poll suggests good night for @theSNP - but it is just an exit poll and there are many marginals, so let’s just wait and see. What it indicates UK wide though is grim. #GE19End of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonMs Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, tweeted that the exit poll suggests it could be a ""good night"" for SNP, but she cautioned that ""it is just an exit poll and there are many marginals, so let's just wait and see"". She added: ""What it indicates UK wide though is grim"".Ms Sturgeon has already pledged to send a letter to the prime minister before Christmas requesting that Holyrood be given the power to hold indyref2. The UK government's cabinet minister, Michael Gove, told ITV he does not believe that another independence referendum is inevitable, despite the SNP's strong showing in the exit poll. The exit poll also predicts that the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson would lose her East Dunbartonshire seat to the SNP.For a nationwide breakdown of results, see our results page, which will be updated throughout the night.If you can't see the look-up click here.Or you can browse the A-Z list.But the Liberal Democrats have insisted that the exit poll does not reflect what the party was seeing on the ground in Scotland. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said that the SNP figure for Scotland was the part of the exit poll ""about which frankly we are least confident"",And he said he would not be surprised if the party's gains were ""rather less"" than predicted. It comes at the end of an election campaign which had focused heavily on the key constitutional issues of Brexit and an independence referendum.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that if the exit poll figures are broadly correct then Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will get the backing he needs in Parliament to take the UK out of the EU next month.It would be the biggest Conservative victory since 1987 and Labour's worst result since 1935, the poll suggests, with the party forecast to lose 71 seats.In the exit poll. voters are asked to fill in a mock ballot paper as they leave the polling station, indicating how they have just voted.The exit poll was conducted by Ipsos Mori at 144 polling stations, with 22,790 interviews.Scotland has only 12 sampling points so the exit poll is harder to forecast than in other parts of the country.Exit polls have proved to be very accurate in recent years. It correctly predicted a hung Parliament in 2017, with no overall winner, and in 2015 it predicted the Conservatives would be the largest party.This has been a remarkable election campaign, unprecedented given the nature of the contest - with Brexit and independence and huge fundamental issues at play.And this is quite a remarkable exit poll.We have to put in all the caveats - these are real voters in real polling stations who have really voted and given their views to pollsters as they came out, but this is only a sample - it can't be drilling down to be 100% accurate.Before the election Ruth Davidson said she would go skinny dipping in Loch Ness if the SNP won 50 seats.If the exit poll is right, she'd better get to the banks of the loch.An increase of 20 seats would put the SNP nearly to the level they were at in 2015, and give Nicola Sturgeon the mandate to demand a further independence referendum."
Should we mute politicians in election debates?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50574247,"TV election debates are still a bit of a novelty in the UK. Each time an election is called, there's the question of whether any will take place, how they will be organised and who will take part. Broadcasters are still experimenting - this time putting on two-way debates, seven-way debates, a climate change debate and a special youth audience debate, among other permutations.So is there room for improvement? And, if so, what might that look and sound like? Here are some expert suggestions. No-one likes it when leaders interrupt and talk over each other. It puts the focus on confrontation rather than discussion and does little to showcase anyone's qualities as a potential prime minister. As US academic Bryan Van Norden puts it, writing for the Hipporeads website, ""There is absolutely no professional or political context in which elegantly interrupting others or being interrupted by others is a useful skill.""He suggests simply switching off leaders' microphones when it's not their turn to speak. As soon as each person has finished talking, off it goes and the next one turns on. Knowing they will go silent could also stop them ""filibustering"", or trying to run down the clock by refusing to stop talking.UK televised debates tend to feature glitzy sets, rows of podiums and heavy intervention from moderators. They are also often quite short by international standards. Time can therefore be tight and the result heavy on soundbites and low on substance.It wasn't always like this. One of the UK's earliest televised political debates was between rival Labour frontbenchers Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn during the 1975 European referendum campaign. They debated the single issue for 50 minutes, with no studio audience, no fancy set and very little intervention. Its often viewed now as a model of ""proper"" debate - two intellectual heavyweights tussling with serious issues, listening to each other's points and responding reasonably. The French presidential debates have run on a similar no-frills model since the 1970s. Candidates sit across a table and there's no studio audience. The most recent, between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, lasted two-and-a-half hours and drew an audience of 16.5 million. It was brutal, with the pair trading bitter insults, ""but it didn't half make for riveting viewing,"" said BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. ""[A]nd at the end of the day, the debate did its job."" No one who watched was left in any doubt who stood for what.If we can't trust politicians to get facts right and tell the truth, then having debates at all is pointless. Much effort already goes into fact-checking, with the likes of independent fact-checking charity Full Fact and the BBC's Reality Check deploying journalists to scour statistics and consult experts in order to verify politicians' claims. Viewers can get updates online during debates or read the verdicts afterwards. But of course not everyone does this, meaning politicians might not be adequately held to account. So the race is on to speed up fact-checking and put it at the heart of the debates themselves. The BBC News channel already uses on-screen Reality Check ""push-backs"" - or text boxes - during its live debate broadcasts. And Full Fact has started live checking for other broadcasters, such as LBC.But as Will Moy, Full Fact's chief executive, says, ""It's something audiences really want but it's hard to do it fast enough to make it matter."" The game-changer looks likely to be the use of artificial intelligence. Full Fact is developing software that can check facts far faster than humans, training machines to spot claims and trawl for data which can prove them right or wrong, So the day when we see automated fact-checks appearing on TV screens in real time during debates may not be far off.Back in 2010 the UK's first modern TV election debate took place in front of a respectful and hushed studio audience, There was no jeering or cheering and they were banned from clapping. Since then, audiences have become more vocal, with spectators cheering, clapping and even booing. It can feel a bit like Punch and Judy.Dr Nick Anstead, associate professor at the London School of Economics' media and communications department, thinks we should go back to silence - and aim for an audience of genuinely undecided voters. ""It would at the very least remove the distortion of the audiences we now tend to have. It would change the atmosphere in the studio and make it less of a bear pit.""Debates routinely involve ordinary members of the public - often by asking them to submit questions for politicians to answer. But this could be taken further. Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, suggests asking people to send in video clips about their lives and problems, which could be sprung on the leaders mid-debate. ""What specifically will you do to help this person?"" they could be asked.Or could broadcasters rip up the debate formula altogether and task politicians with convincing a real voter, while the cameras roll?Matthew Flinders, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield would like to see ""not a debate but a conversation with someone picked out from the public, who would sit down and get to know the politician, understand about their life, where they're coming from and how that flows into their their policies and beliefs.""It could make it harder for politicians to wriggle out of questions and expose them to intense scrutiny - but it would also give them the chance to come across as ""normal"". This could be electoral gold dust: ""It's an element that's been missing so far, No politician has really made an emotional connection with voters,"" Prof Flinders says. Since the UK has never settled on rules for debates, broadcasters and politicians must thrash them out each time. This year the Lib Dems and SNP went to the court to challenge ITV's decision not to include Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon in its prime ministerial debate - though the challenge was rejected.Dr Anstead says there are three conflicting dynamics surrounding debates: the politicians, who want to get their messages across and ""will do anything to avoid generating a negative clip that could go viral""; the broadcasters ""who just want to make good TV""; and ""the democratic need to actually inform voters"". Although politicians and broadcasters would dispute this characterisation, the absence of proper rules means the ""first two are dominating at the moment"", says Dr Anstead.Like the US, Canada has an independent commission tasked with organising official election debates. There are clear rules, consistent formulas for deciding who gets to be in which debates and they are the same from year to year. In the UK, Sky News has been pressing for something similar, with its Make Debates Happen campaign. This year its petition received more than 140,000 signatures and was debated in Parliament.The government's response? ""Televised election debates are a matter for political parties. The government has no plans to change electoral law to make the debates mandatory."""
The voters who can't make up their minds,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50547243,"Will this election be decided by voters yet to make their mind up?The 2017 election did not turn out the way anyone expected. When the election was announced, polls showed the Conservatives with a massive lead over Labour. In the end, the Conservatives lost their majority and there was a hung Parliament.Support for Labour had steadily increased throughout the campaign. In 2019, with just over a week to go, could undecided voters make a crucial difference at this late stage? It used to be the case that few people changed their minds during election campaigns. Most voters had a long-term stable psychological attachment to a political party and they voted for the same one, election after election.  This no longer seems to be the case. British Election Study data indicates that currently just 16% of Britons feel a very strong party identification. Compare this with the mid-1960s, when almost half of the UK population had a very strong party attachment.  In 1966, only about 13% of voters switched parties between elections. In 2015, that figure was 43% - and in 2017, it was 33%. Overall, across the past three elections, almost half the UK electorate (49%) voted for more than one party.In 2017, a significant number of voters changed their minds during the campaign itself - and the same may yet happen in 2019. A recent YouGov poll estimates 13% of the electorate who intend to vote have yet to decide for whom. This group of voters is highly likely to switch parties from last time. Additionally, a recent Ipsos Mori poll suggested 40% of voters might still change their mind between now polling day:Brexit may well play a part in how undecided voters make up their minds, because identification as leavers or remainers appears to have outstripped party allegiance. The British Election Study suggests 50% of people across the UK strongly identify with one side of the debate, which Prof Sir John Curtice calls the emotional legacy of Brexit.  The extent to which this election is dominated by the issue of Brexit could have a substantial impact on the result. In 2017, Labour managed to shift the debate from Brexit to austerity.In the process, it picked up many votes in the latter half of the campaign from younger voters and women hostile to public-spending cuts.The dominant news stories of the past few days of this campaign - and how the parties manage to direct and shape election coverage - could be critical in helping a significant chunk of the electorate make up their mind. Generally, there is little difference between men and women's electoral participation - but women are apparently more likely to be undecided voters than men. In the run-up to the 2017 election, 18% of women and 10% of men did not know for whom to vote, according to the polls. Men and women turned up to vote in equal proportions. But, like many of those who made up their mind later on in the campaign, more women than men voted Labour.   13%Voters have yet to make up their mind 19%of female voters are undecided7%of male voters are undecided16%of C2DE (working class) voters are undecided12%of ABC1 (middle class) voters are undecidedIn 2019, again the polls suggest a smaller proportion of women than men have made up their minds - 19% of women say they don't know for whom to vote, compared with 7% of men. People in working-class jobs are also disproportionately represented among the undecideds - 16% say they don't know for whom to vote, compared with 12% of middle-class voters.  And these undecided working-class voters could make a significant difference to the result, especially in marginal northern English seats where Labour, Conservative, the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems are all  competing for their votes.  There is a great deal of research suggesting the local constituency ground war, and particularly face-to-face contact, matters for mobilising voters - and traditional door-knocking works. And although only a very small number of voters' minds are changed by local canvassing, they can make a crucial difference in marginal seats. There also is strong evidence voters prefer candidates with local connections - research has even indicated the distance between a voter's home and the candidate's residential address is a predictor of their level of support. But we know much less about the impact of targeted messaging on social media.In 2017, Labour was able to compensate for the Conservatives' greater social media spend with more boots on the ground and more individuals sharing posts for free. We don't yet know what the fallout of the online - and offline - campaign of 2019 will be. And without a system for publicly sharing, we might never know.

Major urges support for ex-Tory Brexit rebels,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50687225,"Sir John Major has urged people to re-elect three MPs who were expelled from the Conservatives for voting against Boris Johnson over Brexit.The ex-Tory PM is backing independent candidates David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, all running against his party in the general election.Sir John said ""tribal loyalties"" had been loosened by Brexit.But Mr Johnson described the comments as ""very sad"" and ""wrong"", calling his predecessor's views ""outdated"".The Conservatives say they will take the UK out of the EU in January if they win a parliamentary majority.They say this honours the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of people backed Leave.In September, 21 MPs were expelled from the parliamentary Conservative Party after they had voted against the possibility of the prime minister pursuing a no-deal exit from the EU. Later, 10 of the MPs were allowed back.Of the remainder, Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton are all running as independents in the seats they held at the 2017 general election.In a video message, Sir John, a prominent Remain campaigner, described Brexit as ""the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime"".He called Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve and Ms Milton ""principled, decent human beings"".He added: ""None of them has left the Conservative Party; the Conservative Party has left them.""Without such talent on its benches, Parliament will be the poorer, which is why - if I were resident in any one of their constituencies - they would have my vote."" In response, Mr Johnson said he disagreed with his ""illustrious predecessor"".He added: ""I think it's very sad and I think that he is wrong, and I think that he represents a view that is outdated, alas, greatly that I respect him and his record""And I think that what we need to do now is honour the will of the people and get Brexit done.""Another former prime minister, Labour's Tony Blair, warned that Brexit ""won't be over"" in January.He added that it was ""undemocratic"" to be ""mixing up Brexit with a general election"" .Mr Blair also said: ""Brexit is the substitute of a comforting delusion for the discomforting challenge of a changing world.""Mr Johnson says a Conservative government would be able to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020.Mr Gauke was among those who disputed whether this was possible within the timeline suggested by the prime minister.But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier.Mr Gauke said he was ""delighted"" to have backing from Sir John, who ""represents the best traditions of the Conservative Party"".And Mr Grieve said he had been an ""outstanding PM and Conservative whose moderation and common sense put Mr Johnson to shame"".Speaking on a visit in Hampshire, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the ex-PM's intervention showed Mr Johnson had taken the Conservative Party ""off to the extreme"".""This is a party that bears no resemblance to the One Nation Conservatives that many moderate people in this country have appreciated and that's one of the reasons so many of those people are now going to be voting Liberal Democrat,"" she said.Sir John, who was prime minister between 1990 and 1997, is a long-standing critic of the government's Brexit plans.In September, he joined a lawsuit against the suspension of Parliament by Mr Johnson, arguing it was designed to stop MPs being able to prevent a no-deal Brexit on the then deadline of 31 October.The Supreme Court declared the suspension unlawful."
The 12 key policies in the Labour manifesto,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50501411,"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election.The full document runs to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December?The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS.The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding.Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six monthsThe short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies.This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum.  It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage.The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to £10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting £10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It won't cost the government a penny as it's employers who pay wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay.This would apply to the whole of the UK.Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed.Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst.It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters.For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK.Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care.Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas.Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only.To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s.The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030.In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UKThe party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT.Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government.This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit.Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years.This would apply across the UK.There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students.The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at £12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be £10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010.Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership.Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than £200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a £250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"".Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK.It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country.The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions.This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.  Start a rapid programme of homebuilding.Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies.Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS.

They do this by promoting the party's policies and their candidates' personal qualities. Each candidate must pay a £500 deposit to run for parliament. The money is paid by the parties or the candidate themselves, and they get it back if they win 5% or more of the votes cast.

The results are analysed and used to forecast the overall result of the election. An election where no one party wins a majority is said to end in a hung parliament. Usually the largest party then tries to form a partnership with another party as a coalition government.A majority in Parliament means one party has at least one more seat than all the others put together. That means it is likely to win votes on its policies and plans in Parliament, which can then be implemented.Opinion polls ask people which party they will vote for in the election. The results are used to suggest how much of the vote each party could get across the whole country. But the vote share does not necessarily translate to who gets a majority of seats in Parliament.

Sir John Curtice: Why age not class matters most,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50543903,"Fifty years ago, the way people voted in the UK was largely determined by social class, but different influences are at play in the 21st Century.Back in the 1960s, political scientist Peter Pulzer famously stated that ""class is the basis of British party politics; all else is embellishment and detail"". People in middle-class jobs were more likely to vote Conservative, and the working class were more inclined to vote Labour. Any other differences were relatively unimportant.The picture is now very different. The kind of job that someone does is expected to make very little difference to how they will vote at this election. On the other hand, whether they are young or old may matter a great deal.    Polling companies divide voters into ABC1s (those employed in middle-class ""white collar"" jobs) and C2DEs (those in a working-class ""blue collar"" occupation). These two groups differ little in how they propose to vote at this election.     At 42%, support for the Conservatives is the same in both, while at 33%, support for Labour - a party originally founded to advance the interests of the working class - is only five points higher among the working class than the middle class.(The polls are GB-wide. Because of this, they cannot tell you anything meaningful about the demographic variation on the votes for SNP and Plaid Cymru).This trend has been in evidence for some time. At each of the last three elections, the Conservatives have advanced more strongly than Labour among working-class voters. In the last election, the difference between the two groups had become quite small. This election looks set to repeat that pattern.Conversely, the Liberal Democrats used to pride themselves on attracting support from both sides of the class divide. That claim is now more difficult to sustain. At 19%, the party's support among middle-class voters is markedly higher than among working-class supporters (10%). Also striking, however, is the strength of support for the Lib Dems among graduates. On average, support is some 14 points higher among those with a degree than among those without. This reflects the fact that nearly all Lib Dem supporters voted Remain in the EU referendum, and that, in turn, university graduates are especially likely to back staying in the EU. Support for the Conservatives is higher among those without a degree than among graduates - as might be expected, given that most of the party's support comes from those who voted Leave. This, in turn, helps explain why the party is no longer more popular among middle-class voters than those in working-class occupations.However, if voting no longer differs much between working-class and middle-class voters, it does differ between other groups.More like thisMen and women vote a little differently.  At present the Conservatives are 15 points ahead of Labour among men, but by 11 points among women. According to Ipsos Mori, such a pattern - with Labour performing a little more strongly among women than men - has been in evidence since the 2005 election. A much bigger difference is to be observed between those from different ethnic backgrounds. In contrast to the position in the polls in general, Labour are well ahead among those from a black, Asian or other minority ethnic (BAME) background. According to ICM, 56% of BAME voters intend to vote for Labour, while only 23% are likely to support the Conservatives. BMG puts the figures at 40% and 27% respectively.The most striking difference of all is between younger and older voters. About three-fifths of those aged 65 or older are currently proposing to vote Conservative, compared with less than a quarter of those aged under 35. Conversely, nearly half of those aged less than 35 are backing Labour - but only 17% of those aged 65 or over.There has always been a tendency for the Conservatives to be favoured in greater numbers by older rather than younger voters, with the opposite being true for Labour. Nevertheless, the gap widened noticeably in the 2015 election and even more so in 2017. It looks as though the generational gap could be just as big this time.Younger and older voters also disagree about Brexit. Younger voters are more likely to have voted Remain and older ones for Leave. This helps explain why younger voters are less willing to vote Conservative. However, the generational gap was widening before the EU referendum was held, so it must be about more than Brexit.Some other generational differences in the UK may be playing a role, such as attitudes towards immigration, ease of getting on the housing ladder, and the cost of university tuition.Either way, it is clear that age, not social class, is the division that nowadays lies at the heart of British party politics and will play a significant role on 12 December.

Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit in BBC debate,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50681321,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit in the final head-to-head debate before the 12 December election.During the live debate, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring Brexit ""to an end"" by negotiating a new deal and putting it back to the public in a referendum, alongside a Remain option.Mr Johnson said he had ""a wonderful deal"", and would use it to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January.Other topics covered included the NHS, security and Northern Ireland.Early on in the debate - hosted by Today presenter Nick Robinson - the Labour leader said he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months before putting it to a final say referendum - alongside Remain - within six months.The prime minister countered by saying he already had a withdrawal agreement in place, and would use it to leave the EU next month if he won a working majority in Parliament.But Nick Robinson challenged Mr Johnson, pointing out that while he had a withdrawal deal in place, he did not have a trade deal with the EU, and so could not rule out a no-deal exit in January 2021.Coming into the event, Labour and the Conservatives had spent the day arguing over how Mr Johnson's Brexit deal might affect Northern Ireland.Labour said a leaked document showed Mr Johnson's agreement would have a ""devastating"" impact on Northern Ireland.When the subject arose in the debate, Mr Corbyn said of his rival: ""He spoke at a DUP conference and said there would be no [trade] restrictions [after Brexit] whatsoever, we now know there are restrictions.""But Mr Johnson was met with applause from the audience when he said he found it ""slightly curious"" to be lectured about the union by Mr Corbyn, referring to the Labour leader's past support for those who want to see a united Ireland.Like Brexit, the NHS has featured heavily in the campaign so far - and Friday's debate was no different.Faith, a student nurse in the audience, asked how each leader would deal with a shortage of NHS nurses.The Conservative leader said a government run by him would ""encourage nurses overseas to come"" to the UK ""by shortening the time for their visa applications"" and by reintroducing bursaries for training.Mr Corbyn described the NHS as at ""breaking point"", adding that, under a Labour government, ""£40bn in total would go into the NHS in order to fund it properly"".The Labour leader also repeated one of his main attack lines of the campaign - that a Tory government would allow the NHS to form part of a future trade deal with the US. However, Mr Johnson described that claim as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"".Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM."" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: ""I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts.""Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a ""shoddy end-of-term pantomime"", and said both men displayed a ""lack of honesty"". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the ""chaos"" of Brexit ""is going to go on"", even if the UK leaves the EU next month.And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities.""The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence since the London Bridge attack on 29 November.Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights.Mr Corbyn said the choice was ""not an either/or"". He added the UK could not have security ""on the cheap"", and so Labour would ""back the police up"" with an increase in officer numbers.When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was ""extraordinary and wrong"" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction.In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script.Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain.Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. "
Labour pledges to cut rail fares by a third,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50621621,"Labour has announced plans to slash rail fares by 33% and simplify ticket prices for part-time workers if it wins the election on 12 December.The party also wants to make train travel free for young people under the age of 16 and build a central online booking portal with no booking fees.The proposal is part of broader plans by the party to nationalise the UK's train system.Conservative Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the plan was ""desperate"".The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have also pledged to improve transport. Labour said privatisation had ""created one of the most expensive ticketing systems in the world"", which discriminated against part-time workers, discouraged rail travel and excluded the young and low-paid.Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Our pledge] is much overdue given that passengers have had to suffer rises amounting to about 40% since 2010.""And if we really want to make the shifts that we need to get people from cars into public transport this is a major contribution to it, because obviously that's critical to addressing the climate change crisis.""Labour's manifesto contained a pledge to make rail travel cheaper but no details about what that would entail. The party said the proposal to slash fares by a third would cost £1.5bn per year and be covered by Vehicle Excise Duty - money the Conservatives have earmarked for roads.More generally, Labour says nationalisation - which it plans to achieve within five years of coming to power - will allow fares to be capped and improve the reliability of services.The Conservatives' Mr Shapps said: ""This is another desperate attempt from Labour to distract from their inability and unwillingness to be straight with people on where they stand on Brexit, and the fact they would raise taxes on low and middle-income workers across the country.""You simply cannot trust [Jeremy] Corbyn to deliver what he claims. His ideological plans would wreck our economy, cost people their livelihoods and with the help of Nicola Sturgeon, would waste the whole of next year on two more chaotic referendums.""In keeping with their proposals to nationalise the railways, Labour's plans to significantly cut fares would see a reverse in the direction of travel for policies on train fares since privatisation.Since 1995, successive governments have tried to move the day-to-day cost of running the railways onto fare-payers and away from the taxpayer. At that time, it used to be split 50/50 - now it's more like 75% on the shoulders of the passenger. The argument goes that by raising fares in line with the Retail Prices Index inflation figure each year, government spending on the railways can be reserved for investment in infrastructure. Announced just two days after the average train fare rise of 2.7% was published, and coinciding with major industrial action on several lines in the run-up to Christmas, Labour's proposal for a significant cut to fares could prove popular with commuters.The future of ticketing and rail fares is just one of the issues being looked at by a major review into the UK's railways due to report after the election.It is led by Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways, who is particularly interested in how innovation in aviation fares and ticketing could be applied to the railways.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to freeze peak-time and season ticket train fares for the next five years and cancel the 2.7% rise in rail tickets from 2 January 2020. They also plan to complete the HS2 high-speed rail link.And the Conservatives are pledging to improve transport links as part of a £3.6m Towns Fund.They have also promised to give more funding to local combined authorities to improve bus and train services and put £500m into reversing cuts to the railway network made in the 1960s.The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 rail project - a goal it shares with the Green Party.Regulated fares include season tickets for most commuter journeys, as well as saver returns, standard returns and off-peak fares between major cities. They make up about 45% of all fares. The average change in these figures is capped at July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure. They are due to rise 2.8% in January.Across England, Wales and Scotland regulated fares raised about £3.3bn for the rail operators, according to the Office of Rail and Road.Labour says they will pay for this by ring-fencing income from Vehicle Excise Duty, which the Conservatives plan to allocate to a special road-building fund from 2020-21 onwards.So, an interesting question will be which road projects will be defunded to pay for this pledge."
Sir John Curtice: Has this been a Brexit campaign?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50659248,"Brexit triggered the general election, but is it still the most important issue for voters?The election campaign has now entered its final week. But what do voters say are the most important issues facing the country? And have their views on Brexit become more or less important in shaping how they are likely to vote? This graph shows how people respond now when asked which are the most important issues facing the country, and how this compares with the position at the beginning of the election campaign four weeks ago.All three of the featured polls report a five-point increase in those who mention health. Labour's emphasis on this issue seems to have made some impression on voters.The attention given by all of the parties to the issue of climate change seems to have resulted in an increase in concern about the environment, although it is still relatively low down in the pecking order. None of the other domestic issues appear to have become more important in voters' minds.Meanwhile, Brexit continues to be mentioned far more than any other issue apart from health. There has been no marked change in how important voters think it is.People's views on Brexit continue to be reflected strongly in how they propose to vote.This graph compares how Remain and Leave voters say they would currently vote, and how they said they would vote shortly after the election was called.There continues to be a sharp division between Remain and Leave voters.As many as 79% of Remain voters propose to vote for a party backing a second referendum. At the same time, about three in four (76%) of Leave voters say they will vote for a party in favour of Brexit.More like thisBoth numbers are similar to what they were four weeks ago.However, within both the Remain and Leave groups, there has been a significant change in how people say they will vote. Those who voted Leave have swung heavily towards the Conservatives - support for whom has increased by 12 points - while that for the Brexit Party has dropped by 14 points. Part of the reason, of course, is the Brexit Party's decision not to contest any seats being defended by the Conservatives.Meanwhile, Remain voter support for Labour has increased by five points, and dropped by six for the Lib Dems.In contrast, support for the Conservatives among Remain voters has hardly changed at all. The same can be said about the level of support for Labour among backers of Remain.  In short, most of the movement during the election campaign has consisted of voters shifting their choice from one pro-Brexit party to another, or from one pro-referendum party to another. Very few voters have crossed the Brexit divide.As a result, support for the Conservatives has become increasingly concentrated among those who voted Leave, while more of Labour's vote is now garnered from those who supported Remain.Brexit may not be the only issue in this election. But even at the beginning of the campaign it heavily shaped voters' choices, and it looks likely to do so in the final week of the campaign, as voters make up their minds.

Johnson backs tech tax despite Trump's threats,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50656106,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would press ahead with a digital sales tax even after the US threatened to punish France for a similar move.In a proposal first outlined last year, large online companies face a tax of 2% of UK sales from April 2020.Mr Johnson said digital companies needed to make a ""fairer contribution"".Donald Trump has threatened to impose taxes on French goods in retaliation for a digital services tax that would affect Google, Amazon and Facebook. Ahead of Wednesday's Nato meeting in Watford, the US President said: ""We've taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled.""We'd rather not do that, but that's the way it would work. So it's either going to work out, or we'll work out some mutually beneficial tax.""The US said it would apply tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4bn (£1.8bn) of cheese, Champagne, handbags and other French products. The US has made clear that other countries pursuing a digital sales tax could face similar action.Multinational companies including Google and Facebook have been criticised for paying very little tax in some countries despite booking large revenues due to the way profits can be reported in lower tax jurisdictions.A multilateral solution is being sought but some countries, including the UK, are introducing interim taxes.""On the digital services tax, I do think we need to look at the operation of the big digital companies and the huge revenues they have in this country and the amount of tax that they pay,"" Mr Johnson said late on Tuesday. ""We need to sort that out. They need to make a fairer contribution.""The UK's tax was first suggested by Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and could initially raise almost £500m a year. The pledge to implement the tax is contained in the Conservative manifesto.The Labour Party has also promised a tax on ""multinationals"".  In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically.France is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than €750m ($850m; £670m), of which at least €25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about €400m this year."
The 'race' to return the first election result,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50547003,"The sight of sprinting students carrying ballot boxes into North East counting centres has become a feature of election night coverage. But are Sunderland and Newcastle really engaged in a race to be first with the results?As soon as the polls close across the country at 22:00 GMT on 12 December, ballot boxes will be whisked to leisure centres and community halls for the often long and painstaking counting process. But in north-east England the counting is usually much, much quicker.Sunderland has traditionally been the quickest to reveal the first result of the night - usually within an hour of voting ending. From 1992 until 2015 the first election result was announced there. But in 2017 there were gasps when it emerged near neighbours Newcastle had beaten them by a clear nine minutes.The two cities have long been rivals, especially on the football pitch. But does this extend to election counting too?Despite the obvious vigour with which the cities' youngsters hurry to deliver ballot boxes to the counts, both city councils are adamant there is no race, no competition, no conscious effort to be first.""Our priority is to carry out the elections as efficiently and smoothly as possible,"" a Newcastle City Council spokesman says.""As usual, Sunderland will be looking to run an accurate and efficient count that the electorate and candidates can all have confidence in,"" Sunderland's acting returning officer Patrick Melia says.""It isn't about declaring first, it is about delivering an efficient and organised count,"" Mr Melia adds, saying Sunderland focuses on ""meticulous planning"" and having an ""extremely well organised"" team.It certainly appears to have worked for at least two decades.The city's record of success began in 1992 after it brought in bank tellers to lead the counting and employed energetic teenagers to run the boxes from vehicles into the Silksworth Tennis Centre.Newcastle's recent victory occurred after it moved its counting operation from the council's Civic Centre to the larger hall at Northumbria University's Sport Central, which allows cars to deliver ballot boxes straight to the back door.June Parkinson, a retired civil servant, has been a ""reasonably fast"" counter for Newcastle for the past decade.""I'm sure some people do want to be the first and while that is nice it's not the be all and end all,"" she says.""You are certainly never told you have to be quicker. It's all your own pace.""Apart from keeping an eye out for ballot papers that have been spoiled, often with a few choice ""Anglo-Saxon expletives"", the job is about efficiency and speed.""It is a bit of a buzz,"" she adds. ""You are playing a tiny but important part in the democratic process and history of the city.""I do not feel any pressure, it's just common sense,"" she says, adding: ""It's not rocket science. We are all mature adults that do it and can all count.""So if inter-city rivalry is not driving both cities speedy counting, what is?Low turnouts are not the answer. Newcastle's in 2017 was the same as the national average of 69%, while Sunderland's was 61% - both significantly higher than the lowest turnout in the country, 53% in Glasgow North East.One factor is the rarity of recounts, however. The three constituencies in both cities typically return a winner with a healthy majority. According to Newcastle City Council another incentive for an early result is allowing counters to get home at a reasonable hour. Avoiding late counts also helps limit mistakes made due to tiredness.The council also points to its many city centre polling stations being sited close to the count venue.Whatever the reasons, many eyes will be on the northern neighbours when the polls close on Thursday.If you can't see the look-up click here."
Johnson's race for trade deal strengthens EU hand,https://www.bbc.com/news/the-reporters-50712835,"Over and over again in this election campaign you hear supporters of Boris Johnson confidently asserting that ""he did it with the Brexit deal: he got the EU to renegotiate when most people said it'd be impossible. ""So who cares about those who now openly doubt his ability to get a trade deal done with the EU by December next year? The doubters were wrong before. They'll be proved wrong again.""Except, it seems to be overlooked that Prime Minister Johnson did not charm or bully or manipulate the EU into reopening the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and changing the infamous backstop for the Irish border. It was only by breaking a deep red line of his, very late on in the negotiations, that EU leaders wholeheartedly agreed to a ""new"" Brexit deal (that in reality was almost identical to the one negotiated by Theresa May).If you remember, Mr Johnson had pledged never to allow a post-Brexit division between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.But in the end that is exactly what he did.While on paper and in legal terms Mr Johnson has ensured that Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union and single market along with Great Britain, practically speaking Northern Ireland would continue adhering to the EU's customs code and being part of the EU's single market for goods.Boris Johnson's divorce deal introduces a customs barrier down the Irish Sea. A barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Something Mr Johnson had said he would never countenance.EU leaders negotiated with Boris Johnson in the hope that he would better be able to sell a deal back home in the UK than his predecessor, Mrs May. But they only signed on the dotted line of the backstop's replacement because they were confident that it protected their single market on the island of Ireland after Brexit.For the prime minister, ""getting it done"" seemed of greater importance when it came to the Brexit deal than keeping his word about the union and avoiding a line down the Irish Sea. So how might it be when it comes to trade negotiations? Would Boris Johnson give up post-Brexit ""sovereignty"" and ""control"" to get a quick deal done with the EU by next Christmas?Because if you earwig on EU internal conversations these days, you'll hear that the only way he has a real chance of getting a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) with Brussels done and dusted by next Christmas is if he crosses his own red lines again and gives in to EU concerns. This time over so-called level playing field provisions (such as adhering to EU environmental, labour and state aid rules after Brexit) and allowing EU countries fishing rights in UK waters.If Mr Johnson signs up to ongoing alignment with EU rules, then where's the national sovereignty he promised voters? But if he doesn't, then trade negotiations with Brussels are likely to drag on a lot, lot longer. And could delay closing trade deals with other countries. Japan, Canada, Australia and others are unlikely to want to sign off on a new trade deal with a post-Brexit UK until they know what kind of relationship it will have with the EU. Something else to bear in mind: if Boris Johnson did maintain close ties with the EU, then Brexit-associated divisions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain would diminish; Brussels would have less need for checks, controls and paperwork to closely monitor what is coming in or going out of its single market/customs territory via the island of Ireland.It all comes down to not being able to have your cake and eat it. Those trade-offs - which so many politicians seem very reluctant to come clean about this election season. "

Sturgeon: 'All options' open if indyref2 blocked,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50632400,"Nicola Sturgeon has refused to rule out taking legal action if a Conservative government blocks a second Scottish independence vote.Appearing on BBC Breakfast the SNP leader said she would not hold a Catalan-style unauthorised vote.Ms Sturgeon was pressed on what her options would be given that Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not permit indyref2.  She would ""cross that bridge then"" but would ""consider all options"", she said.The first minister stressed that a majority Conservative government was ""not inevitable"" after the 12 December election and said whoever ends up in No 10 must ""respect the will of the Scottish people"".""I do believe whoever is in Downing Street, they have a duty to respect the will of the Scottish people"", she continued. If Mr Johnson remains as PM and continues to refuse to grant permission for a fresh vote on independence, she pledged she would ""set out how I intend to cross that bridge then"".""We're in an election campaign right now,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""Whatever the polls might be suggesting, and they look as if they are narrowing a bit, a Tory majority isn't inevitable.""Pressed on whether the Scottish government would mount a legal challenge if Westminster continued to refuse to allow a referendum, or would stage an unofficial ballot, Ms Sturgeon said the vote would have to be ""legitimate"".She said: ""I've made my view quite clear on an unofficial referendum, I think a referendum has to be legal and accepted because I'm not in the business of just having a referendum, I want Scotland to become independent so you have to have a process of doing that that is going to be recognised as legitimate.""Beyond that, though, I will consider all options.""Ms Sturgeon wants any referendum to be ""legal and legitimate"", to ensure the result is recognised internationally.This is why she wants the UK government to give formal consent to the vote by transferring powers to Holyrood through what is known as a Section 30 order - as happened in 2014.The first minister has repeatedly refused to be drawn on what exactly she would do if the UK government refuses to agree to a fresh independence referendum, although she noted on BBC Radio 5Live that the question of whether Holyrood could legislate for a poll without a transfer of power has ""never been tested in court"".Ms Sturgeon has however ruled out an unofficial referendum, similar to the one held in Catalonia in 2017, saying that example shows that ""it does not lead to independence"". Ms Sturgeon told BBC Breakfast: ""The first option is making sure we don't get into this scenario because Scotland is playing its part in making sure Boris Johnson is not in this position of being able to lay down the law to Scotland or anybody else.""She said whatever the result of the election ""SNP MPs will always push Scotland's case and fight for those progressive policies, whatever the arithmetic is in the House of Commons"".But Ms Sturgeon said her party's influence would be ""increased in strength"" if there was a hung Parliament leaving ""Scotland is holding the balance of power"".She said the central point in the election for Scotland was: ""Do we have our future decided for us by the likes of Boris Johnson and the people who are pulling his strings, like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump, or do we decide our future for ourselves and the kind of country we want to be?""Ms Sturgeon said: ""If you are asking me to predict, I believe very, very strongly, particularly after the last few years, that given that choice in the future Scotland will choose to be independent.""After her interview on the breakfast sofa, the SNP leader took part in a BBC 5 Live radio programme where she answered questions sent in by the public. The Scottish Conservatives' interim leader, Jackson Carlaw MSP, appeared on BBC Radio Scotland on Monday morning. He was the latest in a series of Scottish party leaders to take part in a live interview and phone-in session. His party have committed in their manifesto to "" stop Nicola Sturgeon's plan for a second independence referendum next year"". The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said his party is the only one committed to ""stopping Brexit and stopping independence"" and argued that Scotland needed to move on from ""constitutional chaos"". Labour say they will not agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the ""early years"" of government. Although Jeremy Corbyn says he does not plan to rely on other parties for support after the election, Ms Sturgeon has said she would consider supporting a Labour minority government on an issue-by-issue basis in return for support of specific policies - one of which is the power to hold another referendum, which the SNP have indicated they want to take place next year.

Statistics watchdog questions Labour crime claim,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50663781,"Jeremy Corbyn has been rebuked by the chairman of the UK's statistics watchdog over his claim that violence had ""doubled"" under the Conservatives.Sir David Norgrove told the Labour leader it was a ""complicated area"".Mr Corbyn made the remark at Labour's manifesto launch on 22 November, blaming a rise in crime on the Conservatives' ""austerity programme"".In response to Sir David, Labour said the Tories could not be trusted ""to fix the crisis they have caused"".In a letter addressed to Mr Corbyn, Sir David wrote: ""I understand that you were referring to increases in the number of violent offences recorded by police forces.""This is a complicated area, with two main sources of data.""The best measure for overall violent crime is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, he wrote, which showed little change in recent years.This measure ""is not affected by changes in recording practices and police activity"", he wrote.""However, while police-recorded crime has significant limitations, it is better suited than the Crime Survey to measuring trends in some of the more harmful crimes that occur in relatively low volumes.""Labour based its claim on police recorded instances of all ""violence against the person"" offences, which rose from 630,000 in 2013-14 to nearly 1.7 million in 2018-19.But those figures included less serious crimes and the UK Statistics Authority said the crime survey is more reliable for those purposes.In response, a Labour Party spokesperson said the Conservatives ""seem more concerned with writing letters than fighting crime"", although the watchdog is an independent body.""You cannot trust the Tories to fix the crisis they have caused,"" the party said."
Did Boris Johnson vote against early prisoner release?,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50630355,"The London Bridge attacker Usman Khan had been released from prison after serving half of a 16-year sentence. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this was ""because of changes to the law that were brought in by the Labour Party that I voted against"". So did he?Khan served a sentence for a plot to set up a terrorist training camp. He was then released automatically after eight years with no review by the Parole Board.Mr Johnson tweeted that this was because of Labour's Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. In another tweet he said: ""Although four senior judges considered that Khan was dangerous, he was to be automatically released halfway through because of Labour's 2008 law.""Khan was originally given an indeterminate sentence in 2012, meaning one with no fixed end date. But during an appeal the next year, this was downgraded by judges to an ""extended sentence"" of 16 years in prison with automatic release on licence after eight. He was released in December 2018 after the time he'd spent on remand was taken into account.  The prime minister told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""His release was necessary under the law because of the automatic early release scheme under which he was sentenced and that was brought in by Labour with the support of Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour Party. I opposed it both in 2003 and in 2008.""Mr Johnson did vote against the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That law meant most offenders would be automatically released halfway through their sentences, but ""dangerous"" offenders on extended sentences were only to be released with the Parole Board's consent. It was the 2008 law that changed these extended sentences so there would be automatic early release with no Parole Board review. A Conservative Party spokesperson said Mr Johnson had ""voted against this Bill on two key votes on the Bill's passage through Parliament along with almost all Conservative MPs and the Conservative front bench raised specific concerns about automatic release during debates on it"". We looked through Hansard - the record of what goes on in Parliament - to find out what happened. The law was first proposed in 2007 - when Labour was in government and the Conservatives in opposition. Mr Johnson did vote against both the ""programme motion""- which sets the timetable for passing the bill - and the motion to carry the bill over into the next Parliamentary session. But at that stage it did not contain the measure that affected Khan's later case.The key clause relating to automatic release on licence for prisoners on extended sentences was added during the report stage - a chance for MPs to review and change the law - in January 2008.MPs voted on this measure as part of a group of amendments on 9 January 2008. The Conservatives voted against but Hansard has no record of Boris Johnson being present for that vote. The bill then had its third reading the same day and was passed without a division - a formal vote. The Conservative opposition could have forced a division but did not.The then Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw said he did not recall Mr Johnson expressing any opposition at the time. Edward Garnier, the shadow prisons minister at the time, could not recall whether Mr Johnson opposed the bill, while Nick Herbert, then shadow justice secretary, declined to comment.Several then Conservative MPs including Mr Herbert, as well as then Labour backbenchers Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, criticised the lack of time to debate the bill. The Times, on the day after the bill was passed, carried just a couple of paragraphs - the focus was almost entirely on a part of bill that stopped prison officers from striking.

Labour Budget to 'end austerity' in first 100 days,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50704546,"John McDonnell has promised to ""end austerity"" in a speech setting out Labour's priorities for its first 100 days in government. The shadow chancellor vowed to ""remake government"" with a Budget on 5 February if his party wins this Thursday's election. He also detailed how newly nationalised water and energy firms would be run. The Tories are also pledging to increase public spending, but not on the same scale.They have criticised Labour's spending plans as ""reckless"", claiming they would lead to an economic crisis within months of the party taking office.Conservative leader Boris Johnson is visiting Labour-held seats which voted for Brexit in the north-east of England on Monday, with three days to go until polling day.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will tour Labour target seats in the south of England.Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was confident an agreement on another Scottish independence vote could be done with Labour, if it needed her party's support to form a government in the event of a hung parliament.But Mr Corbyn has ruled out supporting a Scottish independence referendum until after the next Holyrood election in 2021.As the parties begin their final push for votes, the Liberal Democrats are pledging to table legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the election by introducing two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum.Labour is proposing a big increase in spending on public services and social security, to be funded by higher taxes on companies and better-off workers, plus government borrowing.It is also planning to take train companies, Royal Mail, the water industry, and the big six energy firms into public ownership - and part-privatise BT Openreach. Speaking in London, Mr McDonnell said Labour's planned February Budget would mark ""the date when almost ten years of cuts will come to an end"". He said: ""In our first hundred days, we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership.""We'll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.""We'll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services - those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before.""So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we'll create new People's Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run.""He also outlined Labour's plans to invest in green industries, skills training and regional development, attempting to reverse the decline of manufacturing and the growth of ""dreary, exploitative, insecure and low-paid jobs"".He pledged that a National Transformation Fund Unit, based in the north of England, would be set up before Christmas. His party also wants to set up a National Investment Bank - which also featured in the party's 2017 manifesto - which would have £250bn to lend, with a focus on small businesses whose work ties in to the government's industrial strategy.Mr McDonnell defended his tax policy in the face of criticism from the telecoms tycoon John Caudwell, who said Labour's anti-billionaire rhetoric was ""destroying confidence"" and making wealthy people like him feel ""almost like pariahs"".The Phones4u founder told Radio 4's Today programme that some within Labour ""despised"" success and its economic plans were driven by ""envy"", suggesting that droves of entrepreneurs would leave the country if Mr Corbyn won power. In response, Mr McDonnell said his plans had been ""exaggerated"" by sections of the media. While he hoped the rich accepted they had a social responsibility to address the UK's ""grotesque"" levels of inequality, it was in the end a ""moral choice"" whether they wanted to stay in the UK or leave, he added. The Tories, Lib Dems and Labour all say they would take advantage of low interest rates to borrow money to invest in infrastructure.Labour and the Lib Dems would also increase corporation tax, while the Conservatives have scrapped a plan to reduce it.Labour says it would increase taxes on the top 5% of earners, those taking home £80,000 a year or more, although Mr Corbyn has conceded that some people on low incomes could also pay more tax under the party's plans. The Conservatives have pledged to freeze National Insurance, income tax and VAT rates and promised a tax cut in their first Budget by increasing the National Insurance threshold, so workers will not have to pay it until they earn £9,500."
Nine big things that haven't cut through,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50599633,"Plenty of promises have been made by politicians in the election campaign - but what big issues haven't cut through?One of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's favourite slogans, Global Britain, doesn't actually appear in the Conservative manifesto. There have been arguments about potential post-Brexit trade deals with the US. Global issues such as climate change have featured prominently. And international issues were discussed during the Nato summit. But in-depth discussions about the kind of relationship the UK might want with the rest of the EU, if Brexit was to happen, have largely been avoided.Trade talks, both with the EU and other countries around the world, could be a dominant political issue for years to come. But the choices that would have to be made, and the effect they could have on businesses up and down the country, haven't been addressed in any detail.More than 78,000 children in England are now being cared for by local authorities, according to the latest official statistics - a new high. And in the last decade, the number of inquiries carried out because of fears a child is at risk, has increased by 139%, or 120,000. At the same time, council budgets have been cut. The problems of increasing demand and shrinking finances are well known to politicians from the crisis in adult social care. But the acute difficulties also facing children's services have not been high-profile during the election. The major party manifestos acknowledge the system's need for review and investment, but timescales are less clear.They say:The reasons for the pressures are complicated but academics say rising poverty and cuts to services providing early support for problems are factors. Councils have a legal duty to step in if a child needs protecting and many are overspending to do this. It is a growing, unpredictable cost pushing more and more authorities towards a financial precipice. Tragically, it is also a sign many young lives are in turmoil.Universities have been under the cosh over high fees, grade inflation and overpaying their bosses. So the talk has been about curbing their ambitions. But this entirely ducks the urgent need to expand university places, because they are facing a massive demographic bulge. In the past decade the school population has risen by more than 725,000 - and this surge is about to hit universities. The Higher Education Policy Institute suggests another 300,000 university places will be needed in the next decade to keep pace. It would be the equivalent of 12 new universities the size of those in Warwick or Southampton, or 20 the size of the Universities of Hull or Essex. Families with ambitions for their children to go to university are unlikely to accept them being squeezed out. And this could be an opportunity to build entirely new universities to regenerate areas. But, so far, there are no signs of planning for something imminently needed.The number of free cash machines is falling and politicians have been clamouring for machine operators and banks to do more over the past couple of years.In their manifestos, Labour says it will ban ATM charges and the SNP says it will fight against ATM closures. Being able to take cash out has become harder in recent years. And, according to consumer group Which?, machines are disappearing fastest in the poorest areas of the country. The UK is certainly moving towards becoming a cashless society but it's a way off giving up physical money altogether. It is not just the elderly who are struggling. Within the past couple of weeks, another IT failure at TSB has shown the hot water people find themselves in when payments are not made and they cannot get hold of cash.Something almost all the parties have ducked is the nightmare question of how to handle rising seas: which areas of the country to save and which to abandon. Only the Labour Party's manifesto mentions a key phrase, ""managed realignment"", which, in the language of flood planners, is code for drawing a new coastline.As the oceans warm and the ice caps melt, the level of the waters is increasing - only by a few millimetres a year but raising the spectre of having to decide where to invest in coastal defences and where not to.Stretches of the Lincolnshire coast - the Humber estuary, Norfolk, and the west coast of Wales - are among the UK's vulnerable areas. The awkward fact is despite all the pledges for boosted spending on flood protection, there is nowhere near enough funding to keep the entire UK shore safe.The Treasury allocates funding in a way that favours urban areas, so cities and towns get new barriers. By and large, villages and farmland lose out and almost certainly will in future. But which politician wants to say that out loud?No party's manifesto contains the unpopular measures required to fix growing generational inequality. For young people to afford family homes would require not just cheaper mortgages but lower house prices. Those wanting to climb the housing ladder would benefit because, other things being equal, the price of their current place would fall by less than that of the one they were buying. But a policy goal of lower house prices might frighten floating voters.To help the housing crisis, parties have come up with some policies:Meanwhile, pensioners' incomes (net of housing costs) are now higher than those of people of working age. Why then do working people pay higher taxes for state pensions to rise, despite being on lower incomes than the minority of those who benefit? The answer lies, one suspects, in the grey vote. Cutting universal pensioner benefits or scrapping the triple-lock state pension protection might make fiscal sense. It's absent from the manifestos, one suspects, because lots of pensioners make sure they vote.  It's set to cost £9.3bn and is one of the largest and most complex projects ever undertaken by the Home Office. But there is no mention in any manifesto of the Emergency Services Network (ESN), a new communications system for the police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales, which has been beset by delays and overspends. ESN is due to replace the current service, Airwave, in 2022, but the National Audit Office says ""significant risks"" with the project remain and it's unlikely to be delivered on time. There will be huge questions for the incoming home secretary and ministers about whether to persevere with ESN, what the timescale should be if they do and how the programme should be managed - but voters are none the wiser.The UK has lost the savings habit. An estimated 11 million people do not have £100 to fall back on, leaving finances exposed to an unexpected bill. The official savings ratio - the proportion of income after tax people save - has been low in the past three years (6.8% at the last count, compared with up to 14.4% during the 1990s).For those who do still put money aside, the rewards have been pitiful owing to historically low interest rates and the Bank of England pumping more money into the economy, leaving little incentive for banks to offer better rates to savers.All ages are affected - from youngsters to pensioners - and yet, there are no policies to promote saving for a rainy day and none offering a better outlook for committed savers aside from pensions. Some say the state should concentrate on building a stronger economy to bring these rewards. Campaigners would say political parties always have plenty to say about helping those already in debt but little about shoring up finances with savings to prevent those debts building up in the first place.This can be one of the most visible and upsetting changes to High Streets - often more shocking in towns where begging would until recently have been unknown. People might feel sorry for those begging but also unhappy about a sense of decline and neglect in the communities where they live. None of the parties directly addresses the increased visibility of begging, whether on the streets or on public transport. It is not the same as homelessness or rough sleeping, which are addressed in manifestos. Begging touches on all kinds of sensitive topics - poverty, inequality, addictions, mental-health provision, migration and family breakdown - as well as housing and a sense of towns being left behind. Should there be more interventionist support or more penalties? In their manifestos, Labour, the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru support scrapping the Vagrancy Act (which allows the police to arrest rough sleepers) to protect the homeless.But what should be the response of the incoming government?Clarification and update, 6 December, 2019: An earlier version of this article said that children's services were not on the election agenda; that politicians had been quiet on the subject of free ATMs; that ""some MPs"" had supported scrapping the Vagrancy Act. These points have now been clarified.Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. Edited by Ian Westbrook."
Johnson criticised over reaction to sick boy image,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50717606,"Boris Johnson has been criticised after initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick four-year-old boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital.The picture in the Daily Mirror of Jack, who had suspected pneumonia, spurred complaints about NHS cuts.An ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but he refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked and returned the phone.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: ""He just doesn't care"", while Independent Group for Change leader Anna Soubry called his actions ""appalling"". Mr Johnson was asked by other reporters why he had not looked at the photo, but he did not answer the question directly, instead repeating Conservative pledges for the NHS and promising to rebuild ""the whole of Leeds General Infirmary from top to bottom"".Health Secretary Matt Hancock later visited the hospital to speak to management about the case.He said he was ""horrified"" by the incident involving Jack, adding: ""It's not good enough and I have apologised.""But Mr Hancock would not comment on the PM's reaction, saying: ""What people care about is what are we doing to improve care at Leeds General and across the NHS."" As he left, the health secretary was met by a group of protesters shouting at him. The boy's mother has said she does not want her son's treatment being used as a ""political football"".In a formal complaint to press regulator IPSO, she said she had initially given permission to two newspapers to use her son Jack's image but -  after the story was widely reported across other news outlets - she now wanted to prevent any further publication of the picture or his details.In her letter, she said the actions of the media were ""causing significant distress"" to Jack and his family.Jack was taken into Leeds General Infirmary last week after being ill for six days, his mother told the Mirror.  His mother said he had been seen as soon as he arrived and given a bed and oxygen, but a few hours later the bed had to be given to another patient and Jack was left without one for more than four hours.His mother said she then made a makeshift bed for her son with coats and took the picture. She told the newspaper the doctors and nurses were ""lovely people"", but she was ""angry at the lack of funding and the lack of beds"", accusing the government of ""failing our children"". Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Our hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack's family had a long wait in our emergency department.  ""We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family.""ITV reporter Joe Pike tweeted about his interview with Mr Johnson, which took place in Grimsby on the campaign trail.He asked the PM to look at the photo of Jack on his phone several times. Mr Johnson said he had not seen the picture yet but refused to look at it while Mr Pike questioned him. Eventually, he took Mr Pike's phone and put it in his pocket, saying: ""If you don't mind, I'll give you an interview now.""Mr Pike said: ""You refuse to look at the photo. You've taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. ""His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What's your response to that?""Mr Johnson then removed the phone from his pocket and looked at the screen. ""It's a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family, and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS,"" he said. ""But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had. ""That's why we're making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get Parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward.""The PM then apologised to Mr Pike for taking his phone and returned it. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth called refusing to look at the picture ""a new low"" for the PM, adding: ""It's clear he could not care less.""Don't give this disgrace of a man five more years of driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better.""Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson also said Mr Johnson would not look at the photo because ""he simply does not care"". She tweeted: ""He doesn't care about Jack. He doesn't care about anyone other than himself.""And the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called Mr Johnson ""a man with no empathy and no moral compass"". He tweeted: ""The picture of the young boy in Leeds is horrific. His unwillingness to even show remorse proves just how unfit he is to serve as prime minister."""
The 11 key policies in the Plaid Cymru manifesto,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50506359,"Plaid Cymru has launched its 2019 manifesto, called Wales, It's Us. It sets out the policies it wants to see introduced by the next UK government.The document calls for Wales to stay in the European Union and puts forwards its key aims for Wales under the banner ""Westminster does not work for Wales"".But what are the promises being made in a bid to win over voters on polling day, 12 December?A people's vote on Brexit and campaigning to remain in the EU.In September 2019, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called on his party to campaign to cancel Brexit in a general election without the need for a second referendum. Weeks later, the party's position shifted. Party members voted to support a second EU referendum, unless faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in which case Plaid would revert to unilateral revocation of the Article 50 Brexit process.In a bid to return as many pro-Remain MPs to Westminster, Plaid Cymru has struck an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but is not standing aside for Labour candidates, despite Jeremy Corbyn's promise of a second EU referendum.That decision could make a difference in key Labour-Conservative marginal seats and, if that in turn helps Boris Johnson secure a majority in the House of Commons, then it's curtains for a second EU referendum.Create tens of thousands highly skilled ""green collar jobs"" to fight climate change.Plaid Cymru is promising a £15bn Welsh Green Jobs Revolution paid for by the UK government increasing capital investment for 10 years and Wales getting its share of that. It would also ask the Treasury to allow the Welsh Government to borrow £5bn and use both funding sources pay for ""tens of thousands"" of new green jobs.  Plaid Cymru promises publicly-owned full fibre broadband by 2025 - five years earlier than Labour - and said it would build 20,000 green social homes and spend £5bn making homes more energy efficient and reduce fuel poverty. South Wales Valleys electrification would be completed, followed by the north Wales coast line.Many in the rail industry think it was a mistake to emphasise shorter journey times as the main benefit of electrification, which is expensive. It left some wondering whether spending billions to save minutes on journeys was value for money.But electrification allows bigger trains to be run on lines. They can be more frequent and more reliable. The trains themselves are more environmentally friendly and more travellers might be encouraged to use public transport rather than cars.Businesses have long pushed for rail electrification in areas where demand justifies the cost. As with all major infrastructure projects, electrification requires a skilled workforce which will mean overcoming the current skill shortages. Extra investment in early intervention and preventative health care.Unlike the healthcare on the NHS, social care is not usually free. At the moment some people aged 65 and over will get help towards their costs, but others can pay in full. And social care is delivered by a mixture of bodies - councils, private bodies and third sector organisations.This policy was one recommended by a commission set up by Plaid Cymru to think about radical solutions to a growing problem - an ageing population. It estimated the cost of the policy would be an extra £247m a year, which it described as ""eminently affordable. But the truth is nobody really knows at what the final price tag would be.In a report commissioned by the Welsh Government last year, economist Gerry Holtham suggested an income tax of between 1% and 3% could be used to fund elderly social care in Wales. What's clear is having adequate social care is important for the future of the NHS, as when care is lacking people end up in hospital - increasing the strain on a health service that's already struggling.Establish a national commission to examine changing legislation on drug dependency.Plaid Cymru says the current hard-line approach to drugs isn't working. They say it criminalises those with an addiction, a medical need, or recreational users who ""do no harm to others"". The party is not saying it would definitely decriminalise drugs, as has happened in Portugal. Instead, it proposes a commission to reform drug laws.It also wants a public health focus to dissuade people from taking drugs, to get addicts treated and find solutions to the problems that led them to drugs in the first place. The party says that would leave police free to tackle those who profit from the drugs trade.To fund a £25 a week tax credit for those paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utility bills.In the past decade, Welsh Labour governments signed up to ambitious targets to eliminate child poverty - but the ambition proved too difficult. In May this year, research by charities found Wales was the only UK nation to see an increase in child poverty last year.Now Plaid says it will introduce new legally-binding targets. As a step towards meeting them, it would pay £35 a week to every child in a low-income family. There would also be a tax credit of up to £25 a week for tenants in the private sector who spend more than 30% of their income on rent.The money would be made available for Welsh schools and colleges.Plaid Cymru says schools are facing a ""funding emergency"" and many people working in classrooms would agree. Education is devolved, so Plaid is setting out its stall on education here rather than putting forward a plan that could be implemented at Westminster.An extra £300m a year for schools and colleges seems a healthy increase. But how healthy depends on the benchmark. Day-to-day spending on schools this year is £2.6bn. An extra £300m a year would make a dent in real terms spending cuts of 6% over the past decade.But Plaid's pledge includes money for colleges too, which come from a different pot, as does capital spending. The party says some of that £300m a year would go towards school buildings, including new Welsh medium schools.To oppose the development of new sites for nuclear power plants.This has always been a tricky area for Plaid Cymru. Though they oppose nuclear power on principle, some in the party haven't wanted to turn away the jobs and investment promised by the proposed replacement of the Wylfa plant on Anglesey - the island seat is one of their top targets.Notice that this policy still gives them the wriggle room to potentially support the redevelopment of existing sites. Having said that, in the race for leadership of the party, Adam Price said a new nuclear plant would be an ""enormous burden"" that would be incompatible with Welsh independence.  The target represents two additional officers per community.The challenge for any police force is the loud cry from Joe Public that they want to see more bobbies on the beat. It's a security thing. People feel safer if there's a visible deterrent. So Plaid Cymru's offer of 1,600 more officers in Wales - two per community - will be popular. Though it is probably on a par with the numbers the Conservatives have already pledged for Wales over the next three years. It's worth remembering more crime is detected, prevented and solved from an office. But with the cuts forces have faced over the past 10 years, any increase, regardless of where, would be welcomed.Powers on corporation tax, air passenger duty and VAT for Wales.The Welsh Government has powers over some taxation, but Plaid Cymru wants more to ensure taxation raises the money Wales needs. It wants VAT revenues generated in Wales to remain there and for air passenger duty to be devolved, as happens in Scotland. It also wants Wales to have powers over corporation tax and, like the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru wants to put on hold the planned cut in corporation tax from 19% to 17% for 2020-21.  The party also argues the employee rate of National Insurance should rise from 2% to 4% for high earners. Decisions to go to war should require support of all four UK nations.Issues of defence and war are the responsibility of politicians in Westminster - there is no role at all for the Welsh assembly, Northern Irish assembly or Scottish parliament. Technically speaking, there isn't even a legal requirement for the prime minister to secure the support of MPs before launching military action.However, since Tony Blair's Labour government asked MPs in March 2003 to approve the Iraq invasion, a convention has developed - although not always followed - to consult the UK Parliament. But calls to formalise the UK Parliament's role haven't gone further than the drawing board, let alone include discussion of a role for the devolved assemblies and parliament.Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues such as Brexit, education and the NHS.

Trump wants 'nothing to do' with NHS after Brexit,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50638110,"Donald Trump has insisted the US wants ""nothing to do"" with the NHS in post-Brexit trade talks as he sought to repudiate opposition claims that the health service would be ""up for sale"". On a visit to the UK, the US President claimed he had no interest in increased market access to the NHS for US firms even if handed on a ""silver platter"".But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had ""very serious concerns"".And the SNP said MPs should pass a law to exclude the NHS from discussions. Boris Johnson said the Conservative election manifesto had ""categorically ruled out"" any NHS services, or drug prices, being up for negotiation. In June, the US president suggested the health service would form part of negotiations over a possible future trade deal after the UK leaves the EU, saying: ""When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table.""But speaking on Tuesday morning as he and other world leaders prepared for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of Nato, he issued a different message.""I don't even know where that rumour started,"" he told journalists. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it. If you handed it [the NHS] to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.""Mr Trump's visit comes at hugely sensitive time, with less than 10 days to go before the election - and with the issues of Brexit and the NHS having largely dominated the campaign so far.The US President insisted he would be ""staying out"" of the election. While he remained a ""fan of Brexit"" and thought Mr Johnson was ""very capable"", he said he would be prepared to ""work with anybody"" in No 10. In October, he suggested Mr Corbyn would be ""bad"" for the UK and declined an offer to meet the Labour leader during his state visit. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly claimed that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" if the Conservatives hold onto power. At a campaign event last week, the Labour leader showed an unredacted report that gave details of meetings between US and UK officials.The document shows the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used - and refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks.The Labour leader welcomed Mr Trump's latest comments but said he was far from reassured by them. ""I'm pleased that he's said that but, if that's the case why have these talks gone on for two years?"" he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. ""Why have they been kept secret? I think there is very very legitimate grounds for very very serious concern here.""Mr Corbyn said if he was introduced to Mr Trump at a reception at Buckingham Palace later, which both are attending, he would impress on him how ""precious"" the NHS was to the British people and make clear a Labour government would discontinue trade talks if it was not excluded.On a trip to Salisbury, the prime minister described the opposition's claims as ""pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda triangle stuff"".""I can categorically rule out any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiation... including pharmaceuticals.""And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested Labour was only raising the issue because it had ""no plan for Brexit and no plan for the economy"".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Raab ruled out any privatisation of the NHS ""under the Conservatives' watch or this prime minister's watch"". Trade decisions would be made by the next government ""in the best interest of patients and consumers"", he added.The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said Mr Trump's comments should be taken ""with a lorry load of salt"". He added: ""Trump has repeatedly made clear in the past that everything including the NHS will be on the table in future negotiations.""And SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said its MPs would be pressing for legislation to ringfence the NHS from any involvement in a future deal. ""I don't want the future of our NHS to be dependent on trusting the word of Boris Johnson or Donald Trump,"" she said at a campaign rally in Perth.""Let's have legislation that explicitly and in statute takes any risk of trade negotiations to the NHS away, and make absolutely clear that the NHS not just will not be on the table but could not be on the table in any trade negotiations.""Nigel Farage called on the US president to challenge the ""complete fib"" that the Tories would ""sell the NHS"" to him in a trade deal. ""He has been accused by the Labour Party of wanting to buy the National Health Service,"" the Brexit Party leader told BBC Breakfast. ""It isn't true, I know it isn't true, and I think it would be wholly appropriate for him to say that."""

Are these 'new' hospitals actually new?,https://www.bbc.com/news/50579557,"The Conservatives have repeatedly pledged to build 40 new NHS hospitals.The party's manifesto says they are proud ""to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country"".""We will build and fund"" them, it adds, ""over the next 10 years.""The pledge has been questioned throughout the election campaign. Is it certain that all 40 will be built? Will they be creating new beds and additional capacity or just replacing existing facilities?There will be a £2.7bn investment over five years for the first six hospitals of the 40 pledged. All are existing NHS hospitals and they all have one thing in common - there is no building work happening as yet. For the remainder of the pledge 21 trusts will initially share just £100m to develop the business cases necessary to secure funding for 34 projects.Conservative leader Boris Johnson recently told LBC radio that he would think of an existing hospital being knocked down and rebuilt - even if it is in the same place - as a ""new hospital"".Siva Anandaciva, chief policy analyst at health think tank the King's Fund, says: ""The phrase 'six new hospitals' might suggest the NHS will see its stock of hospitals grow with six brand new, fully staffed hospitals that offer a full range of services.""But - in reality - the promised investment is likely to pay for new facilities on existing hospital sites and the redeployment of existing staff.""So, looking at the first six hospitals, how far along are they and how much is new? More or Less examines election pledgesLeeds Teaching Hospitals Trust is being given funding towards a major building project. The £650m development will sit on the current site of Leeds General Infirmary. It is planning to move out of the older buildings and to keep one modern building. Then the plan is to construct ""two state-of-the-art new hospital buildings"" - one for adult services and one for children's care. The outline planning documents say this would ""consolidate and centralise"" their services. A previous bid of £410m was declined in early 2019 under an existing NHS scheme, according to an analysis by the Health Service Journal (HSJ). Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, is also proposing a major building project, described as ""a new hospital with a full range of acute health services... built on a fraction of the land now occupied"".The trust has told the BBC that it does not know  the final amount it is getting from the government. A previous bid of £343m was declined in early 2019 under an existing NHS scheme, according to an analysis by the HSJ. The current plan for Whipps Cross, says that ""using the site for homes could release funding to support the building of a new hospital, but the money raised would be nowhere near enough to pay for a new hospital.""The trust says it is going ""to rebuild a new hospital"", so is that rebuilding or a new hospital?The trust says the plan is for a new hospital as that is what the government has told them. It says, however, it does not know whether this is a whole new hospital to house all its current services, or a new facility for some of its services.""The details around the funding and the timeframe are being finalised and we are completing our full business case,"" according to the hospital's chief executive.The trust describes its plans as both a facility and a hospital. It is in line for ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" to consolidate acute care in a new £500m project on one of its current sites, merging the two A&E services which it is currently struggling to staff.The BBC was told 85% of the existing services would remain in the same place. The new building will be located at one of the three current sites - in Epsom, Sutton or St Helier. The trust says it has been allocated £450m to fund a refurbishment with possible extensions of existing buildings. It will upgrade facilities at its three sites, including: maternity and children's services at Leicester Royal Infirmary; and a ""treatment centre"" for planned operations at the Glenfield site. The trust says it is being given £400m by the government to ""redevelop its buildings and facilities,"" - this means refurbishment, with a small amount of new building. But there's been a big row about the fact that this is not a new hospital. Local campaign groups have been fighting for a new hospital for years, claiming that proposals don't meet the future needs of the wider West Hertfordshire area. One of them, the New Hospital Campaign, has recently taken the trust to court to challenge its plans for refurbishment of existing buildings.  It has crowdfunded enough to take the matter to a judicial review, for which it has been granted permission.We contacted the Conservatives for more detail about the status of these six hospitals. A party spokesman told us: ""Some will be whole new hospitals and some will be whole new rebuilds.""The overall plan to deliver 40 new hospitals is actually part of a 10- to 15-year project to overhaul health infrastructure, he added.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We've made a manifesto commitment to build and fund 40 hospitals over the next decade, and a Conservative majority government will deliver on that commitment.""Six of the trusts are developing cases for multiple hospitals. In the case of Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, that means ""potentially 12 community hospitals"".Some of the hospitals sharing the £100m seed funding to develop their business case have been exploring proposals for a number of years, or have previously made bids for capital funding through previous schemes.In the prime minister's own constituency, a master plan for the Hillingdon Hospital site began in October 2015.Stage one was completed in June 2016 and the preferred option identified as a new facility on a new site at Brunel University. University Hospitals of Morecombe Bay Trust - in its Five Year Strategic Plan 2015-20 - outlines a scheme for Royal Lancaster Infirmary that ""will allow all clinical activity to be located for the first time into a single modern building on the site, with peripheral buildings vacated and demolished or sold"". This has yet to be undertaken."
McDonnell blames Brexit for forecast Labour defeat,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766114,"Labour's John McDonnell has blamed a campaign ""dominated by Brexit"" for a predicted poor performance by Labour in the election.The shadow chancellor said his party had been hoping ""other issues would cut through"".A BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll put Labour on 191 seats, which would be its worst result since 1935.But others within the Labour Party blamed Jeremy Corbyn's leadership for its projected performance. The first general election results were announced before midnight. In one of the first seats to declare, the Conservatives took Blyth Valley in Northumberland. It had been a Labour seat since its creation in 1950. The exit poll predicts the Tories will have a majority of 86 in Parliament. The final result is expected to be known by Friday lunchtime.Shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman has become the first member of Labour's frontbench to lose her seat - as the Conservatives took Workington, a traditionally Labour seat. Labour's shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman has also lost to the Tories in Darlington, another constituency that backed Brexit in 2016. During the campaign, Labour promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU, and then put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. That position could come under criticism, with the exit poll suggesting Labour would lose a number of seats to the Conservatives in areas that voted to Leave during the 2016 referendum. Speaking to the BBC, Mr McDonnell said if the exit poll is correct, it would be an ""extremely disappointing"" result for his party. ""I thought it would be closer. I think most people thought the polls were narrowing,"" he said. He added that he did not think Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party was ""the big issue"" of the campaign, but rather the issue of Brexit had ""dominated"". Asked if Mr Corbyn should resign if the prediction is borne out, he said ""appropriate decisions"" would be taken when the results were in.If you cannot see the graphic above, click here.Gareth Snell, current Labour MP for Leave-backing Stoke-on-Trent Central, said the exit poll was a ""catastrophe"" for his party, adding that he expected to lose his seat when the result was declared. He said the party leadership was responsible for Labour's predicted losses, and called for both Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell to quit. He accused senior figures in the shadow cabinet who are defending Remain-voting seats in London of ""sacrificing"" candidates in marginal constituencies in the Midlands and the north of England.Phil Wilson, Labour's candidate in Sedgefield - a Brexit-backing Tory target seat and ex-PM Tony Blair's former constituency - said: ""To blame Brexit for the result is mendacious nonsense.""""Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional,"" he added on Twitter.  ""The party's leadership went down like a lead balloon on the doorstep."" Likewise Ian Murray, Labour's candidate in Edinburgh South, tweeted: ""Every door I knocked on, and my team and I spoke to 11,000 people, mentioned Corbyn.""""Not Brexit but Corbyn. I've been saying this for years. The outcome is that we've let the country down and we must change course and fast."" Former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson told ITV News: ""It's Corbyn. We knew that in Parliament.""""We knew he was incapable of leading, we knew he was worse than useless at all the qualities you need to lead a political party."""
Who won the election battle online?,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-50731496,"Labour supporters swamped Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites during the 2017 general election.The online surge was widely seen - if mostly in hindsight - as an indicator that many polls were wrong and that Labour were running the Conservatives much closer than expected. And so it came to pass. What's different this time?The big online story during the 2017 general election was the influence of a host of pro-Labour websites.The Tories spent more on paid adverts, but stories and posts hostile to the Conservatives and sympathetic to Jeremy Corbyn and Labour went more viral, more often.Many of these stories were produced by little known left-wing news sites. Because they're not fuelled by paid advertising, such posts are called ""organic"". But since 2017, changes to Facebook's algorithm - the code determining which posts get seen - have made it much harder for these sites to reach massive numbers of people. When it comes to dishing out organic content to users, Facebook is now more likely to recommend posts from family and friends, and less likely to show you things from organisations and media outlets.That's not the only development. While the ecosystem of left-wing Facebook pages and groups is still a big deal, two rival spheres of influence have grown in size.One is passionately in favour of Brexit. The other is vehemently opposed.At the heart of these three networks are volunteer activists working from living rooms and bathtubs up and down the UK, running Facebook pages and groups that, despite the algorithm changes, still attract millions of likes, comments and shares.The pro and anti-Brexit spheres don't uniformly identify with one party the way the pro-Corbyn networks do.At the start of the election they were the source of bitter internal feuds. On the Leave side, there were fights over whether to support the Brexit Party or the Conservatives. In the Remain universe, Labour and Lib Dem supporters were at each other's throats. That picture has changed substantially. Following Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage's decision to stand aside in Conservative seats, the pro-Brexit online universe now seems far more united behind Boris Johnson's Conservatives. On the Remain side, there's lots more talk of tactical voting, but as it's often hard to make a call as to whether Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP or another party are best placed to beat the Tories in a particular seat, arguments have continued.Could tactical voting kick Boris Johnson out of Downing Street? Or will uniting Leave voters keep him there?The pro- and anti-Brexit pages and groups are full of vocal activists, but not everyone shouts loudly online.There are of course plenty of voters who aren't on social media at all. They tend to be older people who skew Conservative.But added to that, administrators and users of local Facebook groups told us Conservative voters are, anecdotally, generally shyer when it comes to posting online.But there's another group that's gone pretty quiet on Facebook.Younger people have migrated to other social networks - chief among them Instagram - in large numbers since 2017.They are now less likely to engage on Facebook, and more likely to see, for instance, Instagram screenshots of Jeremy Corbyn tweets posted by singer Lily Allen (1.2 million followers) or fitness influencers like Grace Beverley (1 million followers). Those interactions are hard to track - but we do know it's happening in a big way, and is more likely to include pro-Labour messaging.Beyond the Facebook battle, there could be a new ""shy Tory"" wave brewing, or we could be missing a rare confirmed sighting of the often-predicted ""youthquake"" - or perhaps both.Smartphone use continues to rise, and continues to transform the nature of political campaigning. Recent research by media regulator Ofcom says our phones encourage ""passive news consumption"" with people prioritising ""quantity over depth in their news intake"". Parties and activists are trying to punch through with very simple posts - like screenshotted tweets - or dramatic and confrontational videos. Many viral hits were clips from old-school broadcast outlets in which a politician was perceived to have done badly in an interview.For example a video of Conservative minister Nicky Morgan struggling in an ITV interview about nurse numbers received around 14m views across various accounts on Facebook and Twitter.A Conservative MP tries to redefine what 'more' means. Truly horrifying.#GMB #NickyMorgan #GeneralElection19 pic.twitter.com/JTbQr8zRW2End of Twitter post  by @PeoplesMomentumMost of the top viral videos of the campaign were pro-Labour, a testament to the enduring strength of those pro-Corbyn social media networks. However, a couple of pro-Conservative posts managed to rack up significant numbers. The biggest was probably one of Boris Johnson informally chatting to a camera, ostensibly during a tea break.We bumped into Boris on his tea break. Here's what happened ☕️ pic.twitter.com/7pRHiIdcWdEnd of Twitter post  by @ConservativesIf there's one image that's cut through in the final week of the campaign, it's that of four-year-old Jack sleeping on a hospital floor.But will that push enough voters away from the Conservatives to make a difference? Or will the Tory attempt to deliver a clear message on Brexit cut through?If there was ever any suggestion that what happens online and offline elections aren't intimately connected, let it end here.In 2019 we've found internet campaigning just bleeds into everything, with online and offline events bouncing off each other and interacting in curious and unexpected ways. In the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye we unpicked the story of a misleading bar chart which started in a Facebook group and later landed on people's doormats on a paper leaflet, only to be criticised and mocked with memes online.In South Yorkshire we found out how a local group shapes how one town experiences an election, with gentle chat about wheelie-bins and hedgehogs making way for spicy political arguments.Even people who don't use Facebook are often aware of these local groups and indirectly receive information from them. In many cases, these groups are more influential than the local media. Could the very local arguments and micronuggets of news which spread in some of these groups lead to some surprise results?We've been spending every day of the campaign trawling through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more.It sometimes feel like everyone is constantly shouting at each other about the election, spreading dubious claims and counter-claims, and picking apart the latest slip-up by a politician in a TV interview.But most voters don't experience elections in this way. One screenshotted tweet, one Facebook rant or one piece of viral misinformation may punch through the news feed noise of dog photos and football videos and affect the way someone votes.With reporting by Sean Allsop, Jamie Ryan, and BBC Monitoring's Shayan SardarizadehHave you spotted something interesting on social media?

Corbyn and Johnson TV debate fact-checked,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50694698,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have faced off in a head-to-head debate – the last time they are scheduled to meet before election day.BBC Reality Check looked at their claims during the hour-long debate.Reality Check: Boris Johnson talked about his plans for 50,000 more nurses in the NHS in England by the end of the next parliament (ie five years).Of these, 31,500 would be new nurses (19,000 newly-trained recruits and 12,500 overseas recruits). The remaining 18,500 would be existing nurses persuaded not to quit, or to come back.We've previously looked in more depth at how realistic this goal is.The Conservatives also say they will build and fund 40 hospital projects over 10 years - this has been repeatedly questioned in the campaign.The party's manifesto says they are proud ""to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country"".They all have one thing in common - there is no building work happening as yet.There will be £2.7bn over five years for the first six hospitals. For the remaining 34 projects, just £100m is available to develop business cases. Reality Check: One of the most commonly used measures of estimating children in poverty is using the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics.It estimates how many children live in UK households which earn 60% less than the median income. There are two different ways it goes about doing this.The relative low income figure is used by think tanks like the Resolution Foundation, and gives us an estimate of 4.1 million in 2017-18, or about 30% of children.The Conservatives prefer to use the ""absolute"" figure, which is useful in comparing one year with another. Measured this way, the estimate would be 3.7 million children, or about 26%.Reality Check: Labour's spending plans are nowhere near £1.2tn a year. That's the Conservatives' estimate of the extra spending Labour would make during the whole of the next parliament (ie five years). The Conservatives first made this costing of Labour's plans before either party's manifesto was published. When Labour's manifesto was published, some items that the Conservatives had costed were not in it.  But the Tories repeated the analysis and reached the same figure of an increase in government spending of £1.2tn over the course of the parliament. That translates to Labour spending an extra £240bn a year, but the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies costed it at £180bn extra a year by the year 2023-4. Also, the Conservatives' analysis makes a number of questionable assumptions - including that a Labour government reaches full-speed spending on its first day in office, instead of building up to it over five years.It prices Labour's nationalisations at £255bn. This is even more costly than the price tag suggested in a hotly contested analysis by employers' organisation the CBI (£196bn).It says the four-day week will cost £85bn during the parliament - when Labour have set a four-day week as an ambition over ten years. Reality Check: Labour's manifesto said that the party's day-to-day spending commitments would be matched by raising taxes. Their investment spending would be covered by borrowing.But, a few days after the manifesto was published, Labour made a further spending pledge - a £58bn compensation package to women who lost out to changes in the state pension.Reality Check: It is correct to say that the UK would be able to ban live animal exports after it leaves the EU, and the transition period ends.Under EU single market rules, no member state can ban live animal exports. The EU does put a number of animal welfare restrictions on exporting live animals. It is an offence to transport them in a way likely to cause injury of undue suffering. Animals have to be provided with adequate space as well as food, water and rest. The Conservative manifesto pledged to abolish VAT on sanitary products, which is currently 5%. This would be possible after the transition, when the UK will not bound by the EU laws which currently do not allow that tax to fall below 5%. The EU is also in the process of changing EU law so that VAT on sanitary products can be reduced to zero, but this will not take effect until 2022 at the earliest.Reality Check: Jeremy Corbyn defended Labour's plans to raise corporation tax (that's the tax companies pay on their profits). Mr Corbyn is right that it would be lower than the rate in 2010-11, when it stood at 28%. When it comes to standard rates of corporation tax, according to figures from the OECD, France currently has a rate of 31%, but the United States has a rate of 21% (although individual states levy extra taxes on top)."
Brexit Party expels activists over racist remarks,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50722346,"The Brexit Party has expelled a local councillor and dismissed a part-time official after they were filmed making racist comments.The two activists were filmed by undercover reporters for Channel 4 News during campaigning in Hartlepool ahead of this Thursday's election. Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice said his party condemned the ""hideous"" remarks. He added that ""immediate action"" had been taken. In the film, Councillor David Mincher was shown complaining that Muslims were ""outbreeding us"" and ""live like animals"".He boasted that he once tried to bury a pig's head under a mosque that was being built in the town - but later told the programme he made up the story ""as a stupid act of showing off to your reporter"". He was also shown making derogatory remarks about Pakistanis, Somalis and Turks.Gordon Parkin, described as the party's assistant manager for the North East region, was also shown saying Muslims were ""outbreeding us"".He is shown adding that countries that ""will not accept Muslims"" don't ""need a quarter of the prisons we need"".Mr Tice, who is standing as Brexit Party candidate in Hartlepool, said the party took action ""within hours"" when they became aware of the comments. ""I would take the gravest exception to any attempt by Channel 4 to suggest that I or the Brexit Party in any way share, condone or was aware of these views and matters,"" he added. He also criticised the undercover filming by the reporters, and accused the channel of being prepared to go to the ""most extreme lengths"" to discredit Brexit and those who back it. A Channel 4 News spokeswoman said: ""We stand by our journalism"". Here is a full list of all the candidates standing in Hartlepool.It comes as Reece Wilkes, the Brexit Party candidate for Lincoln, has announced he's no longer asking for voters' support on Thursday and is, instead, urging people to vote Conservative in the marginal constituency.Here is a full list of candidates in Lincoln."
Can the UK ban live animal exports after Brexit?,https://www.bbc.com/news/50587148,"Claim: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that under EU law ""you cannot ban the shipment of live animals"".Reality Check verdict: He is right. Under EU single market rules, no member state can ban live animal exports, although the EU does put a number of animal welfare restrictions on exporting them.The prime minister has made this claim repeatedly during the general election campaign and has said ""the opportunity of Brexit"" would allow his government to ""champion animal welfare"".The Conservative Party manifesto also says that the UK would be able to ban live shipments after Brexit, but it does not make a pledge to do so. The party's 2017 manifesto stated the UK could take early steps to control the export of live farm animals for slaughter after Brexit as well. In 2018 the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said a ban was one of the options being considered.There have been a number of campaigns in the UK against live animal exports for slaughter on welfare grounds. Under the rules of the European Union (EU) single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports. This was tested in the High Court in 2014, after the deaths of 40 sheep which were being transported through the port of Ramsgate in Kent.A temporary ban on live animal exports was imposed by Thanet District Council but was challenged in court.It was ruled unlawful because it ""breached a fundamental element of the rules governing free trade in the EU"".The EU puts a number of restrictions on exporting live animals. These include ensuring adequate space for them, and providing food, water and rest. The rules have to be followed while the animals are transported between the member states, and also beyond the EU borders.Under current EU law, it is an offence to transport any animal in a way likely to cause injury or undue suffering.However, transporters of live animals have regularly been found breaking the rules. The EU recently published recommendations for improved inspections in the member states. Under the rules of the EU single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports altogether.Under Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, live exports of animals would continue during the transition period. The transition, which will allow both sides to negotiate a future trade deal, is due to finish at the end of 2020. It can be extended, but Mr Johnson has ruled that out if the Conservatives win a majority in the new Parliament. After the transition, the UK would no longer have to abide by EU single market rules and could introduce the ban. But it might not be completely straightforward.The ability to bring in a ban could depend on the exact detail of any future trade deal between the UK and the EU. Any changes would also have to be in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which the UK is a member. £2.4bnValue 2014-201874% From England
9%From Scotland5% From Wales3%From Northern IrelandWTO rules limit countries' ability to ban imports or exports of goods. This is the basis on which the UK ban would be challenged at the WTO, as the RSPCA pointed out in its 2018 briefing.Also, if the UK banned live exports but still allowed the transport to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this would contravene the rule which prohibits WTO members from treating countries differently on trade in the same product.For Northern Ireland, live animal movements are a key issue, because livestock is regularly moved across the border with the Republic in both directions.An estimated 5,000 lambs are exported to the Republic every week, with 1,000 cattle and 10,000 pigs moving in the other direction.In addition, calves from Northern Ireland destined for France are regularly transported through ports in the Republic. A parliamentary committee looked into this issue and concluded that ""trade in live animals with the Republic of Ireland should be allowed to continue"".  "
Sinn Féin hits out at DUP's 'crazy Brexit agenda',https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50634491,"The Sinn Féin president has accused the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of using its ""crazy"" Brexit agenda as a badge of honour at Westminster.Mary Lou McDonald was speaking at the unveiling of her party's general election manifesto in Londonderry.The party's 15-page document focuses mainly on Brexit and Irish unity.Addressing the manifesto event, Ms McDonald attacked the claim the solution to Brexit would only be found in the House of Commons.""The farce of a notion that you go into the house of chaos at Westminster... [with] Jacob Rees-Mogg as he reclines on the green benches and snoozes off is fanciful,"" she said.Sinn Féin is the second largest party in Northern Ireland after the DUP and it secured seven MPs at the last general election in 2017.Its representatives do not take their seats at Westminster due to its policy of abstentionism.The party's core belief is that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be united as a single independent republic.In its manifesto, Sinn Féin claims credit for securing special status for Northern Ireland and no hardening of the Irish border.It also highlights other areas of focus related to the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, including protecting the Good Friday peace agreement and ensuring automatic re-entry to the EU through Irish unity.The manifesto features polls that the party says show the demand for Irish unity and it calls on the Irish government to prepare for a referendum on unity.Defending her party's abstentionism policy, Ms McDonald said Sinn Féin's ""relentless representation"" had been heard in Dublin, Brussels and Washington and had helped shape the EU's negotiation.""The voice of the north has been heard loud and clear - not only heard, it has been heeded and acted on,"" she said.Some of the party's key manifesto pledges include:Sinn Féin, the SDLP, and the Green Party have reached a pact in the interest of boosting the anti-Brexit vote in certain constituencies in the election.Defending her party's decision to stand aside in some constituencies, Ms McDonald said Brexit ""had the effect of uniting improbable allies amid real threats to people's livelihoods"".""We have come together, set aside very significant political differences and said it is important that people use and lend and borrow votes from others to ensure that - loud and clear again - it is heard that the north has not consented to Brexit,"" she said.Ms McDonald also highlighted the party's desire to see a ""credible"" Stormont executive restored.Speaking at the manifesto event, Sinn Féin's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said the Stormont parties faced the challenge of rebuilding the public's faith in politics.""Confidence in politics in the north is broken and we need to rebuild that confidence,"" she said."
Swinson sorry for backing coalition welfare cuts,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50660212,"Jo Swinson has apologised for voting to cut benefits while serving in government with the Conservatives.The Liberal Democrat leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil her party had been wrong to back the so-called bedroom tax in the coalition government and ""we should have stopped it"".Although some cuts were needed when her party came into office in 2010, she suggested austerity had gone too far.Her party was committed to spend more on welfare and childcare, she added.During the 30-minute interview, Ms Swinson said she was determined to stop Brexit by whatever means possible, including working with other parties in the event of another hung Parliament to try and get another referendum. But she conceded the Lib Dems were unlikely to form the next government and be in a position to fulfil their campaign pledge to revoke Article 50 - the legal process for leaving the EU - without a further public vote.She said she disagreed with her predecessor Sir Vince Cable that the pledge had become an ""unhelpful distraction"" for the party, which has found itself being squeezed in the opinion polls during the campaign.Having only been elected leader in July, she insisted she was ""absolutely here to stay"" whatever the outcome on 12 December. Ms Swinson was repeatedly challenged on her party's record in government between 2010 and 2015 and her personal backing for cuts to benefits and Sure Start children's centres.She acknowledged she had voted nine times for the bedroom tax, the controversial policy which saw working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they were deemed to have more bedrooms than they needed.Ms Swinson, who served as a junior business minister in the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition between 2012 and 2015, was asked whether she would like to apologise to 240,000 of the poorest in society who suffered financially as a result and, in some cases, were forced into hardship.""Yes, I am sorry I did that,"" she replied. ""It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it...I have previously said - and I am happy to say again - [it] was wrong. I am sorry about that and it is one of the things we did get wrong.""Asked about other welfare changes she backed at the time but is now committed to reversing, such as a cap on the overall amount of benefits a single household could receive, she said she had voted for them ""as someone with collective responsibility in government"".She said her party had ""won many battles"" with the Conservatives, such as in securing more money for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and taking many of the lowest paid out of income tax. But she said she accepted the public services had borne too much of the brunt of the government's drive to slash the deficit in the public finances.""I am not going to say in a financial crisis that it was going to be possible with the deficit at the level it was in 2010 not to make any cuts at all,"" she said. ""Some cuts were necessary but the shape of those cuts, the balance between cuts and tax rises I don't think was the right balance.""Labour have long argued that austerity was a political choice and not a financial necessity. Ms Swinson said cuts were unavoidable and the level of retrenchment under the coalition mirrored the plans set out by Labour in its 2010 manifesto, But pressed by Mr Neil on whether austerity was a ""necessary evil or terrible mistake"", she replied: ""Clearly too much was cut, clearly not enough was raised from taxation. ""And certainly the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment.""But she said these decisions were ""almost a decade ago"" and her party was now committed to scrapping the bedroom tax and addressing in-work poverty by reversing cuts to work allowances for families on Universal Credit and helping families with two earners.She said the £14bn the party was planning to spend on expanding free childcare - by funding 35 hours a week of provision for all children aged two to four - ""more than replaces the money that was cut"" during the coalition years.""We have a plan for the future which identifies what our priorities are...and we are being upfront about where the money will come from.""In a special series of election interviews, Mr Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, His interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will be broadcast on Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared"".The SNP launched an attack on Ms Swinson's record as part of the coalition government, following the interview.The party's Pete Wishart said: ""Despite Jo Swinson's best attempts to dodge her shameful record when in government with the Tories, the reality is communities across Scotland will not forgive or forget the Lib Dems for their active part in inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable people in society."""
Corbyn apologises over anti-Semitism row,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50643493,"Jeremy Corbyn has apologised again for incidents of anti-Semitism in Labour. The party leader said sorry twice in 2018, but was criticised for refusing to do so four times in a recent interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil. Asked repeatedly on ITV's This Morning by Phillip Schofield to apologise, Mr Corbyn said: ""Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened.""Labour has been dealing with the row over the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than three years.It was reignited during the election campaign after the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top - had taken root"" in Labour.In response, Mr Corbyn said anti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government.He said internal processes for dealing with anti-Semitism cases were ""constantly under review"" and his door would be open to Rabbi Mirvis and other faith leaders to discuss their concerns if he entered Downing Street.In the interview on the mid-morning programme, Schofield said: ""Here is your opportunity now to apologise to the Jewish community for any anti-Semitism by Labour members"". Mr Corbyn began to answer, saying, ""can I make it clear..."", but was interrupted by the presenter who said, ""no, just say sorry"". The Labour leader replied: ""Our party and me do not accept anti-Semitism in any form. Obviously I am very sorry for everything that has happened, but I want to make this clear - I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it.""Other parties are also affected by anti-Semitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and by us, because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever."""
Lib Dems warn of student mental health 'crisis',https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50660208,"The Liberal Democrats have warned of a mental health ""crisis"" in universities and said institutions must do more to meet their ""duty of care"" to students.Under their plans, universities would be required to guarantee access to high-quality mental health services.They would also have to record and publish data on waiting times for counselling, including maximum waits.The party said some students were having to wait more than six weeks to be seen at the moment.It said recent research showed the average longest wait at a university for counselling was 43.5 days - more than half the length of a standard university term.The Lib Dems are promising to consult with students, universities and mental health charities on the details of the proposed student mental health charter. But it said there should be a legally binding commitment on universities to provide mental health support of a ""certain standard"" and to address ""fundamental failures"" in existing provision. Some universities were struggling to cope with rising demand for mental health services, the party said, while information about how much was being spent was often not available. It said the long-term aim for universities must be to ensure there were no suicides.The BBC's education editor Branwen Jeffreys said the bulk of mental health support was provided by the NHS and there was a lack of detail as to what role the health service, as well as university regulators, would be expected to play. The mental health of students has become a high-profile concern, not least following a number of suicides.  This isn't the first time a charter has been proposed, in his previous role as universities minister in the Conservative Government Sam Gyimah made the same suggestion.  At the moment there is a data vacuum as the Lib Dems suggest, with waiting times for university counselling services not consistently recorded, or at some universities not gathered at all.  But there are two big barriers to what's suggested.  The first is universities are independent organisations who decide their own priorities and that is entirely voluntary. Some have increased support for students only after tragedies. The second is that most mental health provision is in the NHS.   Students register either at their parents' home address with a GP,  or at university.  Information sharing between universities and the NHS has been highlighted as a problem in a recent inquest into a student suicide.  Students are at an age when some more serious mental illnesses are diagnosed. They are also a group where the potential suicide danger may be harder to detect because they have already achieved a lot.  The Lib Dems cited research released in September which suggested many universities do not know or do not record key mental health statistics such as the breakdown for mental health spend in their budget and average waiting times.Of the 110 universities which responded to a Freedom of Information request by the former Lib Dem MP Sir Norman Lamb, more than three quarters were unable to provide data on the longest wait times for accessing counselling.And a third said they did not record average waiting times for seeing a counsellor.The party's health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said this was worrying and universities ""should be bound by law"" to meet the mental health needs of their students.""It is incumbent on our universities to fulfil their duty of care to their students,"" she said. ""For many young people going to university, this will be the first time they are living away from home.""This, coupled with the fact that many universities do not record vital information such as their spend on mental health support or waiting times, means that we are in the middle of a student mental health crisis.""According to the Office of National Statistics, there were 95 recorded student suicides in the 12 months to July 2017 in England and Wales. This was lower than for the general population of similar ages, but does not include suicides among students at further education colleges.Universities UK, which represents more than 130 universities, has said its members alone cannot address their students' mental health needs and they were working closely with NHS England to ensure that long-term funding and policy commitments are fulfilled."
Nigel Farage's interview fact-checked,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50676321,"The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was the fourth party leader to be interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Neil in this election campaign. They covered a number of topics, including immigration and the NHS, life after Brexit and the impact of his previous party, UKIP. BBC Reality Check looked at four of his claims.Reality Check: Nigel Farage is correct that the UK population has increased by about 8 million since 1997, to about 66 million, according to the Office for National Statistics.Reality Check: Nigel Farage made this claim in response to Andrew Neil's questions about how he'd fill vacancies in the NHS and social care, if there were controls, after Brexit, on EU migrants coming to the UK to work. Mr Farage said, in fact, immigration had put a ""massive burden"" on the health service.So, what does the evidence show? The Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body that advises the government, looked at this as part of its report into the effects of immigration from the European Economic Area (EEA).It found that migrants from Europe ""contribute much more to the health service and the provision of social care in financial resources and through work than they consume in services."" It said migrants from the EEA tend to be younger and healthier than the UK-born population, and consume fewer NHS services than them.  It found ""no evidence that migration has reduced the quality of healthcare.""According to the Health Foundation 13.3% of the entire workforce of NHS staff in England, and 28.4% of doctors, are from outside the UK (both EU and non-EU). Reality Check: Nigel Farage said: ""Just take Article 77 of the political declaration, it says on everything, even taxation, we'd be tied to EU rules."" Mr Farage was taking issue here with parts of the Political Declaration - it's the document that sits alongside Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.It sets out a framework for the relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit but is not legally binding. Article 77 pledges that the two parties will create a ""level playing field"", by upholding current standards in ""areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters"".The intention is to prevent UK companies from out-competing European rivals by adopting weaker standards on areas like employment, or by receiving unfair government subsidies.While there is no legal obligation to follow the Political Declaration, the EU would be likely to restrict the UK's access to the single market if it tried to drastically undercut European standards.The 2018 Withdrawal Agreement (known as Theresa May's deal) had an extensive list of binding level playing field provisions, on issues such as taxation and labour standards. These were removed from the revised version (Boris Johnson's deal).Reality Check: Nigel Farage said: ""We took far more Labour votes in the key seats in the Midlands in that campaign and actually the Conservatives got a majority because of us.""Mr Farage, who led UKIP at the time, has claimed credit for David Cameron's victory in 2015 before.He argues that former Labour supporters voting for UKIP helped to give the Conservatives victory in marginal seats, especially in the Midlands and the north of England.It's impossible to know for sure how people would have voted if UKIP hadn't stood but recent research for the authoritative British Election Survey raises some evidence that might question this claim.Their research found that in 2015, UKIP drew about a third of its support from the Conservatives, more than it did from Labour. The authors conclude that ""our evidence shows that UKIP hurt the Conservatives in 2015"". In defence of Mr Farage's claim, the Brexit Party directed us to a 2015 study by Professor Matthew Goodwin of the University of Kent, which found that the impact of UKIP in Conservative seats was ""far more modest"" than in Labour seats.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

When wanting to vote could put you at risk,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50562323,"When you register to vote, your name and address are automatically placed on the electoral roll - a public document available to all. For some, that can lead to a potentially dangerous dilemma.""If I were being really cynical about it, one could argue that it's almost sexual discrimination by the back door,"" says a women we'll call Kate, as we talk about her struggle to access the vote after escaping an abusive relationship, with the two small boys.Kate was always politically engaged. She had been registered to vote by post at her previous address - but it was too dangerous for her to return there to pick up her ballot paper and she couldn't make her new address public for fear her abusive partner could catch up with her.But she still wanted to vote. So she began researching her options. Initially, she found nothing online to help her. Eventually, her mother suggested asking her local council.""The first person she spoke to said she had no idea what my mother was talking about but when pressed did find a senior officer,"" Kate says.""This officer knew that I could register anonymously and checked my current address and advised there was a special form that would be posted to me."" It was the first time Kate had heard of the system. It seems many others don't know it exists. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows 2,268 people in England and Wales registered anonymously in 2016 - rising to 2,525 in 2017, the year of the last general election. But Women's Aid says more than 13,000 women in England were taken into emergency or refuge accommodation in 2016-17.""That is obviously a very small fraction of survivors who had successfully used the anonymous registration system,"" Lucy Hadley, the charity's campaigns and public affairs manager, says. And even after having discovered the option to register anonymously, Kate still had to jump through ""many hoops"". People can apply for anonymous registration only if they have certain documents - such as a court injunction or a letter asserting they would be at risk if their address was publicly available.Previously, these could be issued only by senior figures in crime prevention and social services. But following pressure from a campaign by women's organisations, the list of people who can provide such a letter was last year expanded to include managers at refuges, police inspectors, and registered nurses or GPs. ""My particular court order was not included,"" Kate says. ""It was like another barrier going up. In a situation such as mine - and I'm certainly not unique - there is so much going what with different social services and the courts that having to fight to vote is probably not up there on most people's top 10 to do list.""But Kate was told she could ask her GP. ""I seem to be always up there with tiny children, so I asked there,"" she says. She worried there would be a fee but wasn't charged. ""I got the form to the town hall in time so I am now in the system,"" she says. While she welcomes the recent changes that allow more people to provide evidence, Ms Hadley says more needs to be done to help women like Kate.Most people have to register to vote once only. They will have to re-register after moving house and local councils are likely to check the electoral roll is still correct every year.However, under the current system, anonymous registration lasts a year only. Those registered have to re-apply - and gather all the evidence again - every time they want to vote in an election. According to Ms Hadley, the government says the system is designed to protect those whose safety is ""currently at risk"". But Women's Aid is calling for the 12-month limit to be scrapped.""We are concerned that many survivors will continue to face barriers to voting because they cannot 'evidence' that their current safety is at risk,"" Ms Hadley says.""Domestic abuse does not end when a relationship ends.""We know professionals' understanding of post-separation abuse, and the continued harm women suffer after leaving, can be poor - therefore it may be challenging for survivors to keep accessing an 'attestation' from a professional for anonymous registration after the relationship has ended.""Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS.

Terror attack survivors demand more support,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50628121,"More than 70 terror attack survivors have demanded that all political parties agree a ""charter"" protecting their wellbeing after the election.They want quicker access to mental health support and faster compensation.The group, which includes survivors of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing and attacks in London, also says all venues must set up anti-terror security plans.Its demands follow Friday's London Bridge attack, in which two people were stabbed to death.Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, are being honoured in a remembrance service at Guildhall Yard in the City of London on Monday.Boris Johnson launched an urgent review after it emerged that convicted terrorist Usman Khan - who was shot dead by police following Friday's attack - had been released having served half his sentence.The prime minister blamed legislation introduced when Labour was in power and said there were currently 74 people convicted of terrorist offences who had been released early.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Conservatives of trying to keep people safe ""on the cheap"" and called for more funding for public services, including probation and mental health.The survivors' group, which has written to the Daily Telegraph outlining its demands, includes Brendan Cox, whose wife the Labour MP Jo Cox was killed in 2016 and Gina Van Dort, whose husband Chris Dyer died in the Tunisia attack in 2015, in which 30 Britons were murdered.Its letter says: ""We are sick of the promises [made by politicians] that never materialise. The promises to look after victims who then face months of delay for mental health support or years of waiting for compensation.""We ask all of the parties to agree to consult on and implement a new 'Survivors' Charter' that would guarantee basic rights and services for survivors.""The group wants MPs to back ""Martyn's Law"", compelling all owners of events spaces to have in place a ""basic security plan"". This is named after Martyn Hett, killed in the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, in which 22 people were killed.The group says it is ""sick of promises that never materialise"" but praises the ""heroes"" who confronted Khan on London Bridge, preventing him from continuing his attack.It also asks the public not to ""give the terrorists what they want by sharing videos or views from attackers or by blaming whole groups or giving in to hate"".And it wants the media to ""allow survivors the space to recover after terrorist incidents and to focus coverage on the heroes rather than the attackers"".Three people were injured in Friday's attack, which Khan began at a prisoner rehabilitation conference, organised by Cambridge University, at Fishmongers' Hall, next to London Bridge.Two of the injured remain in hospital and are described as being in a stable condition."
Where do the parties stand on Brexit?,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48027580,"The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK gears up for the general election on 12 December.But where do the parties stand on Brexit?Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to leave the European Union (EU) with the revised deal he agreed.He says that with a majority Conservative government, he would start the process to ""get Brexit done"" on day one of the new Parliament.He previously said the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". However, Mr Johnson was forced to write a Brexit extension letter to the EU, after MPs failed to approve his revised deal.Mr Johnson secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May. It includes scrapping the controversial Irish backstop and replacing it with a new customs arrangement.Brexit left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line. Ten were later welcomed back.If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. It says it will achieve this within six months.Labour says its referendum would be a choice between a ""sensible"" Leave option versus Remain. Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship.This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. If a referendum was held, Mr Corbyn has said he would remain neutral if he was prime minister ""so I can credibly carry out the results"".Just like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"".While Labour's election strategy early on was to emphasise that the vote was about more than Brexit, it is changing its focus.The message now is that Labour's leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Mr Johnson's deal - it wants to find what it believes is a better one.The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum on Brexit. Alternatively, it wants Article 50 revoked if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit.The SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU.The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the general election.The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference. If the Lib Dems do not win a majority, they would support another referendum.Leader Jo Swinson says that stopping Brexit would free up £50bn, over five years, to spend on public services.She says that so-called ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra money for schools and to help support low-paid workers.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons during the last Parliament. However, while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU, it opposes elements of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal which relate to Northern Ireland,.At its manifesto launch, the party said it will seek further changes to the deal if he is still prime minister after the election.The deal includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland. One gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a majority vote on how customs arrangements would work after Brexit.The DUP wants such a vote to be taken on a cross-community basis, rather than a straight majority.This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour, in part because of their positions on Brexit.It backs another referendum, or ""People's Vote"", and wants the UK to remain in the EU.The party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting Leave in the referendum. It wants a further referendum and to Remain.In a bid to get as many pro-Remain MPs as possible into Parliament, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Greens have agreed an electoral pact in 11 of the 40 seats in Wales.The party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another referendum, and believes the UK should stay in the EU.The Brexit Party wants the UK to leave the EU without a deal, in what it calls a ""clean-break Brexit"".It says that is the way to ""start changing Britain for good from day one"" and that the transition period after leaving would not be extended. It also says Mr Johnson's revised Brexit plan is a bad deal.Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU. A public vote was held in June 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain.More news explainers"

'I killed the Lib Dems and hurt Labour' - Farage,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766123,"The Brexit Party has ""killed the Liberal Democrats and hurt the Labour Party"", Nigel Farage has claimed.A BBC, ITV and Sky News exit poll suggests the Conservatives will win 368 MPs in the 2019 general election - 50 more than at the 2017 election.Labour is expected to win 191 seats and the Lib Dems gain one to have 13. The Brexit Party looks unlikely to get any.But Mr Farage said he was happy with his ""influence"", and that his party had killed off hopes of another referendum.Speaking to the BBC after the announcement of the exit poll results, he said the Conservatives would win or come close in dozens of seats where they otherwise would not have done without the Brexit Party taking thousands of votes (from their opponents).He added: ""I killed the Liberal Democrats and I hurt the Labour Party.""If you cannot see the lookup tool, click here.Counting is under way in most of the UK's 650 constituencies.

Yes of course.""Born out of frustration with delays to the UK's departure from the EU, the Brexit Party was launched in April 2019, with ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage leading it.When asked if the Brexit Party was now ""finished"", Mr Farage said: ""We've used our influence, that's the important thing. If we get Brexit... we've done a good job.""Arron Banks, who campaigned to leave the European Union alongside Mr Farage, said the exit poll suggested a ""brilliant victory"" for Boris Johnson, who now had a ""strong majority"" to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU.He added that while the Brexit Party was now ""over"", the ""pressure"" applied to the Tories had helped return them to their ""roots"".""We set out to make the Conservative Party conservative again - and it's job done,"" he said."
The 12 key policies in the Green manifesto,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50464641,"The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its 2019 manifesto, called If Not Now, When? It sets out the polices the party aims to introduce should it win the election.The full document, sets out a ""Green New Deal"" - proposing measures from replacing fossil fuels to insulating houses and investing in cycle paths. Greenhouse gas emissions would be cut to zero, to tackle climate change. All major parties promise strong action on the climate, but the Greens are the most radical by far.The Conservatives passed a law obliging the UK to halt virtually all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour is aiming for earlier than 2050. The Liberal Democrats are even more ambitious, with a 2045 target. But the Greens say emissions must be eliminated by 2030. It would mean, within a decade, petrol and diesel vehicles being replaced. Gas heating boilers would be switched for, say, hydrogen. All homes would be well insulated and all emissions from industry avoided or captured in rocks. People would eat less meat, drive less in smaller cleaner cars and curb flying.The advisory Committee on Climate Change, which provides independent advice to government, says 2050 is the earliest credible date for achieving net zero emissions for most sectors of the economy. These targets would apply to the whole of the UK.Funding for the NHS would rise by £6bn a year until 2030, with a further £1bn per year for nursing higher education. The Green Party is earmarking £6bn a year of the money raised from its tax policies to increase the NHS budget in England above existing plans. Labour has committed to a similar annual increase by 2023/24, but the Green policy would kick in immediately and run till 2030. But predicting what the NHS will need a decade from now is anyone's guess.The party wants a ""huge"" reduction in private sector involvement without saying quite how much will be retained (for example using private hospitals for routine surgery).  There is a push for devolution of healthcare to local communities. But there can be wide variations in quality in different areas ,and removing national level scrutiny may not always be in the best interest of patients.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will also benefit from any extra funding. Tackle climate change by transforming the economyThe Green Party manifesto envisages a significant revolution in how the economy functions, spending over a trillion pounds during the five-year Parliament.The basic philosophy of spending tens of billions on decarbonisation is common to most of the parties standing for election, but the Greens argue that the low interest rates currently charged on government borrowing create ""an unparalleled opportunity for public investment"" to tackle the issue.A carbon tax will apply to all oil and gas extraction and to the use of petrol, diesel and aviation fuels. This will raise consumer prices, and frequent flyers will face a levy. Petrol and diesel cars will be phased out by 2030. The manifesto focuses on the new jobs in new clean and green industries, but clearly under these plans many jobs will be lost in currently existing carbon-intensive sectors - from manufacturing to automotive to aerospace.This will apply to the whole of the UK economy, although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may have some freedom in how they implement the policies. Encourage farmers to adopt greener working practices, and reduce meat in our diet. The Greens want 50% of farms to be doing agro-forestry in a decade - that's growing vegetables or raising livestock between rows of trees. This would change the way the countryside looks, but the farmers' union say it's not impossible.The Greens insist the UK must reduce emissions of methane from cows and sheep, by phasing in a tax on meat and dairy products over 10 years. This will be controversial. But they say they'll use the revenue to help farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods.Much of this will apply to the whole of the UK.Thousands of new homes for social rent every year.The Greens will give local councils the power to bring empty houses back into use and setting an affordable living rent for all tenants. It is an ambitious and radical vision for housing delivery that, they argue, puts quality of life first - thinking about local green space, access to cycle ways and pedestrian access to shops and transport.  However, it sees the state taking a much more prominent role in the delivery and management of housing, particularly in the rental sector, a change of emphasis that will concern some house-builders and landlords.     Housing policy and some elements of transport are devolved. No tuition fees for undergraduates and write-off debt for ex-students who paid a £9,000-a-year fee. This is a big offer from the Greens to young people. The cost to cover a single undergraduate year group during their whole time at university costs about £9bn. The cost of writing off existing debt for graduates who have paid fees of £9,000 a year or more is estimated by economists at about £33bn.Education is devolved so this will only apply in England. Scottish students already don't pay fees at Scottish universities. A Universal Basic Income for all adults, regardless of their income. The Greens say this would simplify the current system, replacing most existing benefits except housing benefit. They say this will free people from job insecurity and help those not reached by the current system.They say that no-one currently on benefits would be worse off under Green UBI, which would roll-out completely by 2025. There would be extra for families with children and pensioners would get £178 - nearly £10 more than the current state pension.It's expensive - the Greens have costed their proposal at £86bn on top of current pension and benefit spending of £256bn. It would be paid for by a tax on carbon emissions and other tax changes, such as removing the income tax personal allowance.  Opponents say other welfare arrangements would more efficiently help those who need it most. This is likely to apply to the whole of the UK, although devolved nations may have some discretion in implementing it.Get 10 million homes to the top energy rating within 10 years.This is an ambitious goal. Your Energy Performance Certificate, or EPC, is a measure of how energy-efficient your home is. Almost every building has one, and you can check your rating online. The average rating is D. Very few homes get the highest A rating, which is what the Green Party is aiming for.The Greens are particularly interested in fixing existing buildings. They call this plan ""a deep retrofitting"" which, along with better insulation in every home, will cost £24.6bn.UK nations have control over their own housing policies so the Green Party would need to coordinate with the devolved administrations. Extend plastic bag tax to bottles, single-use plastics and micro-plastics.All major parties now have plans to curb plastic waste. The Greens want to extend the plastic bag tax to plastic bottles, single-use plastics and microplastics - and to expand plastic bottle deposit schemes.They would ban the production of single-use plastics for use in packaging. But some experts fear that that apparently straightforward policies developed at a time of political stress can lead to the use of other materials which might be worse for the planet in different ways. For instance, glass bottles, for instance, don't typically harm wildlife, but they are much heavier than plastic, so they create higher carbon emissions when they are transported.At the moment these kinds of policies are decided separately by the UK government for England and by the devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Free personal care at home for people aged 65 and over.Older people who need a lot of help with tasks such as washing, dressing and medication would no longer have to pay for that help at home. Such a system has operated for 20 years in Scotland, where a weekly contribution of £177 is also made to the cost of residential care. The Green Party manifesto doesn't mention residential care - this might explain their low estimate of the overall cost of free personal care. It says councils in England would get £4.5bn a year to provide this support. Experts estimate the cost of free personal care in England in both settings would be £6bn a year in 2020/21 rising to £8bn by the end of the next decade. Also scrap HS2 and electrify the whole rail network. The Greens want the car to be increasingly seen as out-dated. Money for cycle routes would represent a massive increase on previous governments' spending. A rail network which runs solely off electricity is a noble promise, however, at present roughly two thirds of the UK's network is not electrified. And their wish for more train services hits a more basic problem: in a lot places there simply isn't any spare capacity. That takes us to one of their other grabby proposals: scrap HS2. The project hasn't been well-managed and will possibly cost more than £100bn. But the scheme is in motion and has already cost more than £7bn. Proponents say it's needed to free up capacity for more passengers and freight. The Greens' transport wish-list feels revolutionary, but some of it will be hard to achieve in a quick timeframe and without spending large sums of public money.Transport is partially devolved but overall policies on the UK's rail and road network are dealt with by the UK government.Replace it with a ""fair and proportional"" alternative.Analysis by Tom Barton, BBC political correspondent: The Greens tell us they want to reform the UK's ""disgustingly unfair"" first-past-the-post voting system. Under it, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency becomes MP, with no benefits from coming a close second.In 2017, the Green Party won more than 500,000 votes, but had just one MP elected. Voting reform is popular among smaller parties and is perhaps the only issue that unites the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. However, the public has been asked what it thinks about one proposal - introducing the Alternative Vote system under which voters would rank candidates - at a referendum in 2011. And 67% voted against it. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. "
The 12 key policies in the Lib Dem manifesto,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50459123,"The Liberal Democrats have launched their 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Stop Brexit Build A Brighter Future. It sets out the polices the party aims to introduce should it win the election.The full document runs to 96 pages and contains pledges on a variety of subjects, with Brexit and the NHS to the fore. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and, potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December?Article 50 would be revoked and Brexit cancelled.The words ""STOP BREXIT"" appear in large capital letters on the front of the manifesto. Uniquely among UK-wide parties, the Liberal Democrats are promising to revoke Article 50 immediately - and stop Britain leaving the EU without another referendum.The pledge stands out from Labour, who would offer another vote, and the Conservatives, who are promising to leave the EU in January. The Liberal Democrats believe the clarity of this approach won them votes during the European elections - and can be a vote-winner again.  It also underpins their plans to increase public spending - the Liberal Democrats say staying in the EU would deliver a £50bn ""Remain bonus"" to the economy - money that could be spent on public services.This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.Raise £7bn a year over five years - a total of £35bn - to spend on the NHS and social care.The one penny in the pound extra on income tax will be ring-fenced for the NHS and social care. But this is a vague concept and simply means the party has promised £7bn a year more for health and social care and identified how the revenue might be raised.  It will be hard to track precisely how the money is spent.Longer term, the party wants to move to a dedicated health and care tax. which is called ""hypothecation"", to reassure voters their money is for key public services. The big problem is that in an economic downturn the tax receipts might fall, and, if so, would the government feel obliged to cut health and care spending? If the Treasury was obliged to top up funding from the central pot, the benefits of hypothecation would be lost.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will also benefit from any extra funding.All children aged two to four will qualify for 35 hours a week, 48 weeks a year. This is an eye-catching and potentially eye-wateringly expensive election promise. According to the independent economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, it would represent an extra £13bn a year, which is four-and-a-half times higher than the current level of spending.  This is an expensive offer that could attract criticism as a big giveaway to some better-off parents, while not helping the poorest children who might benefit most. Currently all three to four-year-olds with both parents working can access 30 hours free childcare, unless either parent earns more than £100,000 a year.  Childcare is a devolved issue.Achieve this target by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions.Even by the standards of an election busy this target is ambitious. We are already on a path of rapid decarbonisation - with 40% of our electricity produced by wind, solar and biomass in the third quarter of this year.And recent government projections suggest that contribution is set to rise to just under 50% over the next decade. So the Liberal Democrats' plan for 80% would mean the extremely rapid construction of many more solar farms and wind turbines on land and out at sea. Only the Green Party envisages a faster transition. These targets would apply to the whole of the UK.Those who take the most international flights face a tax rise, while costs would come down for people who take one or two international return flights a year. The statistics suggest a frequent flyer levy is justified. More than half of those surveyed by the Department for Transport in 2014 said they had not taken any flights in the previous 12 months. The Lib Dems' policy becomes less radical when you consider people only taking one or two return flights a year would pay less tax. The UK already has one of the highest rates of Airport Passenger Duty in the world. Unsurprisingly airline bosses are against a rise. Ultimately they could pass any additional cost on to passengers. Then it comes down to whether their customers are prepared to pay more. With aviation's impact on the climate in sharp focus, some type of tax reform feels inevitable. This policy would apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Air taxes are devolved to Scotland. Spend £10.6bn more a year on schools and hire thousand of new teachers by the end of the next Parliament. The promise of another 20,000 teachers in England's schools and falling class sizes may be deceptively hard to deliver. Schools in England decide how to spend their own budgets. Many of the posts that have disappeared have been support staff such as counsellors or librarians. Head teachers may restore these posts first. There is so much pressure to get results that teachers' jobs are often the last to go, although some are quietly not replaced. There are 453,400 teachers already in England but there is also a population bulge hitting secondary schools, which is due to continue until 2025. So while primary class sizes might shrink, secondary classes could grow. Education is fully devolved to each part of the UK.Help to break the grip of the criminal gangs by introducing a legal, regulated market for cannabis.Legalising the recreational use of cannabis for adults is one of the most radical of the Lib Dems' proposals, having first appeared in its 2017 manifesto. The Lib Dems believe it would help ""break the grip"" of the criminal gangs that profit from the lucrative trade in illegal drugs. And it's a powerful argument. But evidence suggests legalisation would not end the cannabis black market for under-18s, nor for those wanting more potent strains. There is also concern it could encourage greater use of the drug and act as a gateway to more harmful substances - which is why most of the other political parties will not make the same, bold commitment. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.The freeze would apply to all peak-time and season tickets for the next Parliament.Too many commuters in too many parts of Britain have suffered an unreliable service for too long. So a fare freeze for all peak-time and season tickets seems…fair!The Liberal Democrats say the taxpayer would foot the bill. They reckon it will cost £1.6bn over five years. For context, operating and maintaining the UK's rail infrastructure costs about £6bn a year. When you consider inflation, the policy in effect makes rail travel cheaper. The more intractable issue is how to make it better. The Liberal Democrats are committed to completing the HS2 high-speed railway, which would create extra capacity. They say they would also spend £15bn on enhancements to the existing rail infrastructure over five years. That's above recent rates of spending. Rail fare regulations are devolved. Pay boost the higher minimum wage for people working on zero-hours contracts.Some form of pay bonus for insecure work has been suggested before. Matthew Taylor, who led a review into UK working practices, has suggested a 15% minimum wage boost, echoing a similar policy in Australia, whereby a 25% pay premium is added to casual work.Jonathan Cribb, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the proposal is interesting for two reasons: It could reduce the number of firms who want to hire people on zero-hours contracts and it could mean people in regular employment might seek out a zero-hours contract because they like the flexibility. He says: ""So essentially, there could be fewer opportunities for these contracts and more people searching for them.""This policy would apply to most workers across the UK.In the next 10 years, 10,000 more unaccompanied refugee children will also be allowed into the UK.Since 2015, about 16,000 refugees have found sanctuary under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, which was set up for those affected by the conflict in Syria. In June, the government announced that in 2020 it would replace the programme with a global resettlement project for 5,000 refugees each year.The Lib Dems' proposal, therefore, would double the number taken in by the UK, with an extra 1,000 unaccompanied children allowed to settle each year. The practical difficulties associated with the idea include finding enough local authorities prepared to house the refugees and ensuring that they're not exploited once they're in the UK.This policy would apply to the whole of the UK.Brexit bonus funds new teachers, flying taxes fight climate change.The Liberal Democrats are positioning themselves as the most fiscally virtuous of the major parties, with the toughest rule on borrowing. That means they've raised taxes, and are going to be the only party promising a basic rate tax rise. Many of the tax rises are specifically earmarked for spending commitments. Known as hypothecation, this is very much out of fashion at the Treasury which prefers everything to go into a central pot. The manifesto says the air passenger duty rise will go to the fight against climate change, business taxes will pay for an increase in free childcare and an extension of free school meals. The problem is that if any of these sources of funding falls short individually, will they really defund the spending promises associated with it? Bring the supply of new houses into line with demand.A total of 300,000 new homes a year is the current official target for England, but governments have consistently struggled to meet it - England gained only 220,000 last year. This is due in part, to the whims of builders and planning factors.More striking are tweaks to the tax system. These include permission for local authorities to levy up to six times the typical council tax fee on homes left empty for more than six months a year, and basing stamp duty on a property's energy rating. For tenants, there are plans to help with up-front deposit costs through a Help to Rent loan for all first-time renters under 30.Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. "
"Labour's £6,000 bill fact-checked",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50657736,"Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the Conservatives' failure to curb bills has cost the average household an extra £5,949 a year since 2010. But how has Labour arrived at this figure and do their sums add up?Labour has provided a breakdown of annual bills and costs, which it says have risen since 2010:That adds up to £5,949. But there are several factors to be considered. First, the overall figure assumes that every household consumes the same range of things. For example, Labour's average household has two people buying annual rail season tickets - but many people don't regularly travel by train. The Department for Transport estimates that in England in 2018, just 11% of trips were by rail or underground. Part of Labour's average cost is for childcare for a two-year-old, but not every household has children. The second point is that the report takes the difference in cost between 2010 and 2019 (or 2018) and comes up with a total that is applied to every year. ""A decade of cuts and the Conservatives' failure to curb rising bills, have cost families almost £6,000, a year since 2010,"" the report says. But using Labour's figures, that sum really only works for the final year. The difference would be much smaller from 2010 to 2011, for instance. The final point is that the prices of most goods and services have risen over the past decade - that's inflation. Some of the things in Labour's report have risen less than the measure of wider inflation. Labour has used Ofgem data to arrive at this figure.Its data shows the average dual fuel bill was £1,116 in 2010, rising to £1,184 in 2018. So bills have risen by £68 over the period.However, that rise is below the wider rate of inflation. According to the Bank of England inflation calculator, a bill of £1,116 in 2010 would be worth £1,405 in 2018 prices.Average annual bill in £As before, Labour has not just adjusted its figures for inflation.Water UK - the source Labour has used for its claim - points out that bills are rising more slowly than inflation.""Bills are going down by more than 5% in real terms between 2015 and 2020, and by 2025 there will have been over a decade of falling bills once inflation is taken into account,"" it says.Labour says that broadband bills were £13.31 a month on average in 2010, rising to £30.30 a month on average in 2019.Once again, these figures have not been adjusted for inflation, but they also come from different data sources, so are not strictly comparable. Rail fares do increase every year - in line with a measure of inflation called RPI. Since 2010, season tickets have gone up an average of 35%, according to industry body the Rail Delivery Group.Labour's report assumes that two people in the same household are purchasing annual season tickets, which may not be representative of all households.Prescription charges only apply to England. Labour has arrived at the figure of £22 by multiplying the increase in the charge since 2010 (£1.80) by 12, so assuming one person in each household pays for a prescription once a month on average. Many people such as children, pensioners and new mothers do not pay for prescriptions. Going back to the Bank of England inflation calculator, the rise in prescription charges is actually slightly below the rate of inflation.The cost of prepayment certificates, which can significantly reduce costs for people who need to pay for a lot of prescriptions, has actually been frozen since 2011. £1,916 more on average for childcare per childOn childcare, Labour says £1,916 more is spent on average for childcare per child, per year.The number comes from a well-known survey, which indicates that childcare costs have risen above inflation.But there's a big caveat here - that calculation only covers two-year-olds. For three and four-year-olds, the government has put money into providing free childcare. Labour has used the English Housing Survey from the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), which is a national survey of people's housing circumstances in England, to arrive at their figure.The MHCLG data shows that in 2010 the average weekly rent was £156 and in 2018 it was £193. That's a difference of £37, which equates to £1,924 for a year. Again, there's no adjustment for inflation. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Staff testimony given to Labour anti-Semitism probe,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50666884,"Seventy serving and ex-Labour officials have given sworn statements to an official investigation in to Labour's handling of anti-Semitism allegations.The statements form part of a submission - seen by the BBC - from the Jewish Labour Movement to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).The commission announced a formal investigation earlier this year. Labour said it was committed to rooting out anti-Semitism in the party and the country.The Jewish Labour Movement is asking the EHRC to urge the Labour Party to acknowledge it has become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" and needs to change.The EHRC declined to comment, saying its investigation was ""live and ongoing"".The Jewish Labour Movement has been affiliated to the party for a century and represents about 2,500 members.It asked the EHRC to look in to Labour's handling of anti-Semitism allegations - and its submission argues that anti-Semitic conduct has become ""pervasive"" in recent years.It suggests there are no reliable figures for how many cases of anti-Semitism still have to be dealt with by the party's complaints team, despite the Labour leadership arguing processes had been speeded-up. The Jewish Labour Movement is claiming that 136 complaints were outstanding in October while around 100 allegations were not logged in the system at all.Labour say these figures are inaccurate but have not provided any official statistics on the issue since July. The Jewish Labour Movement's submission includes a signed affidavit from a former Labour official who alleges they were asked to transfer details of complaints being investigated at Labour's headquarters to the party leader's office.A Labour spokesman said the party is not institutionally anti-Semitic and it was the only party to have published any figures on cases. He added that under the party's new procedures there would be more rapid expulsions - and Labour was co-operating with the EHRC."
How much does a general election cost?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50170067,"Parliament will be dissolved on Wednesday, so the 2019 general election campaign will then officially get under way. So what are the rules for parties and MPs on spending in the run-up to polling day on 12 December?In the run-up to an election, there are rules around campaign spending to try to keep the race fair. They can sometimes be vague, but they cover spending by political parties in the year before a general election - and can also include polling day.Each party must record and report all campaign spending to the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections. This includes money spent on:Political parties' spend is also capped at £30,000 for each constituency that it contests in a general election. So if a party stood a candidate in each of the 650 UK constituencies, its maximum spend would total £19.5m. £140m2017 election cost to taxpayers£30,000maximum party spend per constituency650UK constituencies£7,500party donations above this amount must be declaredSpending can even include expenses related to attending party events. For example, 62 reports of spending in McDonalds were logged with the Electoral Commission around the last election. In the 2017 general election, 75 parties and 18 campaign groups reported spending more than £41.6m between them.The Conservatives spent most at £18.6m. It fielded 638 candidates, winning in 317 constituencies. Labour came in at £11m and the Liberal Democrats at £6.8m.Slightly less was spent on the 2015 general election at £39m.Campaigners who do not belong to a party have to register with the Electoral Commission if they plan to spend more than a certain amount on their campaign. That's more than £20,000 in England, or £10,000 in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The two biggest campaigns - the pro-EU Best for Britain and the National Union of Teachers - were listed as non-party campaigners in 2017's early election. Both spent more than £250,000. When a general election is called, there are a lot of things that need to be organised, and paid for. It is difficult to estimate how much the forthcoming election might cost. But, we do know that after former Prime Minister Theresa May called the 2017 general election, the cost to taxpayers was more than £140m.A Cabinet Office minister said that £98m was spent by returning officers to run the poll in their constituencies, while £42m went on posting material to voters. Before the 2001 general election, there were no limits on what political parties could spend on national campaigns at a UK general election.Today, if spending rules are broken, the maximum fine is £20,000 per offence. The Electoral Commission has called for this to be increased, and offences can include delivering late or inaccurate spending returns. The Conservative, Labour and Women's Equality parties were investigated for weekly spending reports that were inaccurate ahead of the last general election. The Conservatives received the largest fine for this at £6,250.Individuals hoping to become an MP in the House of Commons also have to keep an eye on their spending.At a local level, each candidate's spending limit is different. It is calculated by adding together a fixed amount of £8,700, plus either 9p or 6p per registered voter in their constituency. The extra amount depends on whether it is a county constituency, or a smaller, built-up borough. Candidates have to report the costs of advertising, administration fees like telephone bills, and staff. They need to keep a log of all payments for election expenses, as well as receipts for any payments over £20. Political parties have to report information on donations to the Electoral Commission every quarter.Every donation of more than £7,500 which is made to a party must be declared, along with those of more than £1,500 made to a party's ""accounting units"". They are bits of a party whose finances are not managed by its headquarters. Donations in Great Britain can be accepted when they are made by individuals on the electoral register, most UK-based companies, trade unions or building societies. In Northern Ireland, the rules are broadly the same, except that donations can also be accepted from Irish citizens and registered organisations.Between April and the end of June this year, 16 parties accepted a total of £14.6m in donations."
World Cup: Tories in £550m grassroots pledge,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50695211,"The Conservatives are pledging to invest £550m in grassroots football as part of plans to back a UK and Ireland bid to host the 2030 World Cup if they form the next government.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the investment would ""transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics"".It would boost existing plans for amateur football in England.But Labour said the funding would not make up for ""years of brutal cuts"" to sporting facilities.The Football Foundation partnership between government, the Football Association (FA) and the Premier League has existed since 2000. It is promising to improve 20,000 grass pitches in England or build new Astroturf versions.The new Tory pledge would see the government's current grassroots football funding commitment to the project rise from £180m to £730m over the next 10 years.Speaking after a short kickabout with children in Cheadle, he said he wanted to ""bring football home"".It is unclear where the additional government cash would come from, but private partners are expected to fund the remainder of the investment, which would now amount to £2bn in total.The FA has said that only one-in-three English community pitches are of adequate quality, with one-in-six amateur matches called off due to poor pitch conditions.The Conservatives said every funding bid would be assessed against several factors, including whether it provides equal playing opportunities for females.The party's manifesto also includes a policy of ensuring all major new sports facilities cater for a range of different activities.Labour had previously voiced its support for a 2030 World Cup bid.Shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said: ""This Tory pledge won't undo the years of damage done to grassroots sports facilities by a decade of austerity.""A last-minute election pledge can't make up for years of brutal cuts.""Meanwhile, the Lib Dems have announced a policy of re-introducing safe-standing at top-flight football stadia.The party says the practice works safely in Europe and will lead to more choice, better atmosphere and cheaper tickets for fans.Standing in English football's top two tiers is illegal after recommendations made following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which led to the deaths of 96 fans."
What does the US do for Nato?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44717074,"US President Donald Trump believes Europe's Nato members should spend more on the alliance, rather than relying on the US to shoulder the burden.Ahead of this week's summit in the UK, Nato's Secretary General, Jans Stoltenberg, has said the contribution made by European countries has been increasing significantly in recent years.So what does the US contribute towards maintaining Nato compared with the other 28 members?Nearly 70% of the total spending on defence by Nato governments is accounted for by the US.But the US is a global superpower, with military commitments well beyond Europe.In terms of its gross domestic product (GDP) (the total value of goods produced and services) the US spent roughly 3.4% on defence in 2019, according to Nato estimates, while the average in European Nato countries and Canada was 1.55%. Nato's running costs are met by a common funding arrangement based on each country's national income. This is to cover:The civilian and military budget for 2019 is about €1.67bn (£1.43; $1.84bn), according to Nato figures.The US is currently paying for just over 22% of this, while Germany's contribution is 14.76%, and France and the UK just under 10.5% each.Running costs for 2018-19But this is now set to change after a new formula was agreed to reduce the US contribution, according to Mr Stoltenberg. ""Now the US and Germany will pay the same, roughly 16% of Nato's budget,"" he has said.At last year's Nato summit, President Trump urged the other member states to commit to spending 4% of their GDP on defence, close to the current US figure of 3.4%In fact, the current target is to reach 2% by 2024.  When Mr Stoltenberg visited Washington earlier this year, Mr Trump said again this 2% figure should go higher ""at some point."" Mr Trump has also said things are starting to improve. ""Since I came to office, it's a rocket ship up,"" he said.In fact, 2019 is the fifth year to have seen an increase in spending by Nato members other than the US. The biggest increases have been in Eastern and Central European countries and in Turkey.Nato estimates for 2019 show there are now eight countries - in addition to the US - spending 2% or more of their GDP on defence. Other European members spent an estimated 1% to 1.99% in 2019, with France spending 1.84% and Germany 1.36%.Nato members also pledged that by 2024 at least 20% of their defence expenditure should go on acquiring and developing equipment. As of 2019, 15 Nato countries in addition to the US were on course to meet this target, with major increases since 2014 in Eastern European countries as well as Turkey.However, two major Nato members - Germany and Canada - still spend less than the 20% threshold on equipment.An analysis for the UK Parliament describes equipment expenditure as a more meaningful measure of defence capability because without adequate equipment, military effectiveness is reduced.The US still has tens of thousands of active-duty personnel in Europe, including Turkey. Germany currently hosts by far the largest number of US forces in Europe, followed by Italy, the UK and Spain.It is worth adding some US personnel based in Europe support non-Nato operations and US military numbers fluctuate as forces are rotated in and out of Europe.September 2019Also, the biggest single overseas deployment of US personnel is not in Europe. It's in Japan and there are also large numbers in South Korea.US forces also have a significant presence in the Middle East and the Gulf, although exact figures are not always disclosed and some deployments are only temporary. In Afghanistan, the US currently has about 13,000 troops involved in counter-terrorism operations and with the Nato-led mission there, which supports Afghan security forces.One key component of the US commitment to Europe is a missile defence system run by Nato members. It is designed to help guard against potential long-range ballistic missile attacks from outside the continent, particularly the Middle East.It includes US equipment and personnel at land-based missile sites in Romania and at one under construction in Poland, with a US-operated radar system hosted by Turkey. Interceptor missiles are also carried on board US warships in the Mediterranean.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
Boris Johnson's interview with Andrew Marr fact-checked,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50624056,"Boris Johnson gave a wide-ranging interview to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, focusing on security but also covering Brexit, and the NHS, as well as the plans of the Labour Party. Here are his most eye-catching claims fact-checked. Claim 1: The government is putting extra money into counter-terrorist policingDiscussing measures to tackle terrorism in the wake of Friday's London Bridge attacks, Mr Johnson said: ""We've obviously invested a great deal in counter-terrorism in the Spending Review. We put another £160m into counter-terrorism."" In September, Boris Johnson's government announced its spending plans for 2020-21. These only included increasing funding for counter-terrorism in line with inflation.Those plans also include a pledge to continue for another year ""the additional £160m announced at Budget 2018.""In fact, Budget 2018 only increased counter-terrorism funding by £59m or 8% on the previous year, as this written answer in the House of Commons shows. The £160m is the difference between spending plans announced in 2015 and the figure eventually spent in 2019-20. Claim 2: ""Jeremy Corbyn has said he would disband MI5""BBC News has asked the Conservatives for the evidence behind this claim, and is still awaiting a response. Labour has denied that Jeremy Corbyn wants to disband MI5.The claim may relate to a campaign in 2015, run by a group called Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory, which issued a statement with a number of demands including ""disband MI5"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is still listed as a signatory on that website. He did admit to signing it according to press reports, though he claimed to have done so in error, and did not support disbanding MI5.Current shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott signed a parliamentary motion in 1989 calling for the abolition of MI5, but has since changed her views.Claim 3: ""We have a Queen's Speech that was blocked by Parliament.""In fact the Queen's Speech was passed by 16 votes on 24 October.Claim 4: The government was already moving to stop automatic early releaseMr Johnson said: ""I also said in August that we would no longer allow the automatic early release of serious and violent offenders. And what we are doing now, is there is a bill that was in the Queen's Speech to prevent automatic early release."" The Queen's Speech included a Sentencing Bill, which would change ""the automatic release point from halfway to the two-thirds point for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violent or sexual offences"".Offenders considered ""dangerous"" already receive an Extended Determinate Sentence, of which around 250 were imposed last year. They are not considered for release until they have served two-thirds of their sentences.Claim 5: The largest NHS investments in modern memoryBoris Johnson said: ""...we are so determined to make huge investments in the NHS. The largest in modern memory. £34bn.""The Conservatives' plans do involve increasing funding for the NHS in England in cash terms by £34bn. However, accounting for inflation, the real increase would be £20.5bn by 2023-24. At a 3.2% annual increase, it is less than the 6% average achieved by Labour governments between 1997 and 2010, according to the Health Foundation. And most of that extra spending was already announced by the government before the election. The Conservative manifesto only pledges to increase health spending in 2023-24 by £2.9bn - just a third of one per centage point more than was already planned, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Some prisoners can't be deradicalised - PM,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50633351,"Boris Johnson has said the ""grim reality"" is that ""some people can't be rehabilitated"" in prison.The PM called for longer sentences and an end to automatic release after convicted terrorist Usman Khan killed two people on London Bridge on Friday. The father of Jack Merritt, one of the victims, says he would not wish his son's death ""to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences"".Labour have accused Mr Johnson of using the attack for political ends.And in an article for the Guardian, Mr Merritt's father Dave said his son ""would be livid his death has been used to further an agenda of hate"".""What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens,"" he wrote.""That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise.""Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.""Mr Johnson denied claims he was politicising the attack, saying he had campaigned against early release for some time, having previously raised the issue during his 2012 campaign to be mayor of London.""I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt's family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia, who perished at London Bridge,"" he said.""But be in no doubt, I've campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years.""He said he has a bill ""ready to go"" in the Queen's Speech, if his party were elected to power on 12 December, to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders. ""We have too many people who are released automatically onto our streets and we need to address that,"" he said.The Conservative Party leader said Khan should not have qualified for automatic early release from prison after he was jailed in 2012 over a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.Asked about the fact that Khan was not deradicalised in prison, under the watch of the Conservatives, Mr Johnson replied: ""When we look at the problems that we come across in trying to deradicalise people, we have to face the grim reality that in some case it really is very difficult and I think this was one of those cases.""He said Khan's case showed ""some people can't be rehabilitated"".""Unquestionably there are some cases to tough to crack and alas he was one of them,"" Mr Johnson said.The prime minister said on Sunday that 74 people jailed for terror offences and released early will have their licence conditions reviewed.Mr Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were honoured at vigils in London and Cambridge on Monday.Khan was given a special jail term known as Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant he would serve at least eight years and could not be released unless he had convinced the Parole Board he was no longer a threat.But in 2013, the Court of Appeal replaced the sentence with a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison.He was released on licence in December 2018 - subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"", police said.Khan was shot dead by police on London Bridge on Friday.No-one sentenced to a terrorism offence is now subject to automatic early release under current laws.Former justice minister Philip Lee, who defected from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats over Brexit, criticised his former party's record on prisons, He said the London Bridge attack highlighted ""a system that was under stress"" and one in need of ""proper funding and proper reform"".He added that the criminal justice system ""had to bear the brunt of quite significant cuts to its funding"" and during his time as justice minister he ""never really felt it was a priority in government to fund justice, because it doesn't tend to be a vote winner"".""It only becomes a vote loser when things start to go wrong, or when people think mistake have been made and that's what happened in this particular case,"" he said.""The prime minister is notorious for being loose with the truth.  And now he's waded in to something incredibly complex, and starts talking about we need to 'bang them up' for longer. ""That might play well in some simplistic way, but you need to address capacity of the prison places. You do that by the police, prisons and probation all working together.  In an ITV election debate on Sunday, Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said he was ""very uncomfortable with the way the discussion from the Conservatives moves straight from a tragedy to reheating pre-packaged political lines smearing the Labour Party"".He added: ""I think our democracy, regardless of our parties, should be better than that"".But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: ""I think these people should never ever be let out prison unless we are absolutely convinced they do not have the jihadi virus. But political correctness stops us from doing that."""
Spot the difference on the NHS,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50587279,"The NHS has been one of the key focuses of the election campaign with the political parties battling it out to be seen as champions of the health service.This should come as no surprise. While many assumed this election was going to be largely about one issue - Brexit - the future of the NHS has actually been up there as the other big priority for voters. Some polls even suggest it is more important.But what separates the promises the parties are making? The three main parties in England - health is devolved so the Westminster politicians do not control policy in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland - have sought to use both their pre-manifesto announcements as well as their manifesto launches to highlight their health policies. Labour, in particular, has gone on the attack, accusing the Tories of plotting to sell off the NHS in a future post-Brexit trade deal with the US - something the Tories are insistent they will not do, even making it part of their manifesto pledges. It all suggests there is some kind of ideological difference in the approach to the NHS. But dig beneath the surface and what is quite remarkable is just how similar the policies actually are rather than how different. Let's take the most important factor first - funding. All three parties are promising above-inflation increases to the budget for front-line care. And, importantly, in each case this is at a faster rate than has been the case since the financial crash of 2008. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like the environment, Brexit and the NHS. The Tories - being the party in government - had already set out their plans ahead of the election. During 2018 they put forward a five-year spending plan which is seeing the budget rising by 3.4% a year above inflation. It means by 2023-24 there will be £149bn of funding available. NHS England budget (£bn)By comparison Labour has proposed increasing it by 3.9% - that will bring the budget to £155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems are marginally behind this coming in at £154bn.But some experts say the £6bn gap between Labour and the Tories could in fact be slightly narrower. The Treasury - under the Tories - has already promised to help meet the rising cost of NHS pensions, and if you factor that in, the difference could be around £3.5bn. That is enough to make an impact, but hardly points to a great division in approach given the size of the budget. That much is clear from the sort of things that all of the parties are promising to spend their money on:Even when there appear to be significant differences in ambition, the truth is much more nuanced.Take nurses, for example - the Tory promise of 50,000 may seem to be more generous than the Labour pledge of 24,000. But the Tories have factored in improving retention (an important issue if you are going to grow the workforce) whereas Labour has not.It makes determining which plan is more ambitious incredibly difficult. But regardless of that, what is missing from all the pledges is the detail on how exactly any of this will be achieved.This lack of detail is also apparent in other areas away from the front-line budget. All three parties have talked about investing in buildings.Labour is promising to increase the annual budget to over £10bn by the end of the next Parliament - it is currently £7bn. The Lib Dems, once again, are not far behind that. The Tories say spending will increase, but are not saying by how much. Although, it is clear from their focus on buildings - Boris Johnson is constantly championing the 40 new hospitals he wants to see built over the next decade - that the budget will be going up. So when it comes to the NHS, is there actually a big decision in terms of who to vote for?At the end of the day, all you have heard during the election are promises and projections.What matters is who can deliver - and that means making judgements about competency and which party will be best for the economy.That in turn means looking at their policies on Brexit, tax and the nation's finances - in short deciding who in reality will have the most money to spend on health.It is those things that will go a long way to determining the health of the NHS in the future.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"
Labour pledges to electrify England's bus fleet,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50691088,"Labour plans to make England's entire bus fleet electric by 2030 with a £4bn investment, if it wins the general election.This would reduce bus emissions by more than 70%, cutting air pollution and helping to tackle climate change, the party said.But Conservatives claim the plans are part of ""Labour's war on the motorist"".More than 3,000 bus routes have been cut or reduced over the past decade, campaigners said in October.Labour said its plans would boost British manufacturing and help ""revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities"".There are 35,000 buses in England but only 700 are electric, and mostly in London, Labour said.Labour says the cost of this policy will be under £4bn over a 10-year period and will come from Labour's Green Transformation Fund.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The Westminster bubble doesn't care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out.""Away from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down.""Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, added: ""The Tories' manifesto didn't pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services.""Labour would give local authorities the power to create council-owned bus companies, replace cuts to bus funding and invest more (at a cost of £1.3bn a year), and provide free bus travel to under-25s in areas that bring bus services under local ownership (at a cost of £1.4bn a year by the end of the parliament), it said.The funding will be drawn from Vehicle Excise Duty - formerly known as road tax - with Department for Transport money directed away from road building.The pricing is based on the cost of buying new electric buses, and reimbursing bus owners for phasing out fossil fuel vehicles before the normal end of road life.While bus services are devolved, Labour said it would make money available across the UK.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Labour's war on the motorist continues apace.""Labour won't be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways.""The Conservatives have pledged to ""help local authorities to partner with bus companies to create new superbus networks"" and make £50m available ""to develop the first all-electric bus town or city"".Road campaigners said in October that bus service funding has been slashed over a decade.Local authority funding for bus services fell by more than 40% over that time, while central government funding fell by 19%, the Campaign for Better Transport said in October.However, the Department for Transport said at the time it supported local bus services with a £250m annual grant to keep fares lower.Liberal Democrat shadow transport secretary Wera Hobhouse said on Friday: ""The steady degradation of bus services by the Conservatives across the UK is a disgrace.""The Liberal Democrats would spend £4.8bn on restoring bus routes over the next five years.""We would also spend £970m on funding electric buses and coaches, reducing emissions and ensuring our transport system plays its part in tackling the climate emergency."""
Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI?,https://www.bbc.com/news/50705261,"The claim: Boris Johnson said goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would only be checked if they are expected to be moved onwards into the Republic of Ireland. He told Sky News ""the only checks that there would be, would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland"".Reality Check verdict: Some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will have to be checked even if they are staying in Northern Ireland.The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed in October means that Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules.A Treasury document leaked a few days ago suggested this would mean new checks on goods being traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.For example, the EU has particularly strict rules on importing ""products of animal origin"" - that is to say meat, fish and dairy products.Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked.Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks whether they are destined to remain there or be moved to the Republic of Ireland.The island of Ireland is already a single regulatory zone for animal health.This means that all livestock entering Northern Ireland from GB is currently checked at the point of entry.A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments of meat and dairy product are checked.It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to get rid of checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market.The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Who are the UK's three million tactical voters?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50493728,"The issue of tactical voting is looming large in discussions about how the 2019 general election will play out. Tactical voting happens when a voter abandons the party or candidate they prefer, and votes for one with a better chance of winning locally - often, but not always, in order to defeat a disliked candidate.  Relatively small changes in the number of votes a candidate receives have the potential to make a big difference.At the 2017 election 174 MPs were elected with less than half the vote, and in 2015 it was 334 out of 650. In those constituencies, supporters of the parties that came third place or lower, could have defeated the MP by backing the second-placed party.   Surveys after recent elections saw about one in 10 voters - around 3 million people - saying they voted tactically. The number of people voting tactically has not changed very much since the 1990s, despite the fact that people switch votes between elections more frequently. It seems that tactical voting is not driven by political sophistication or general willingness to consider switching, so much as how much support there is for lower-placed candidates in constituencies, and how much supporters of those lower-placed candidates like their second-choice party and dislike one of the top contenders.Tactical voting is not particularly more likely to happen in closely fought constituencies, where a relatively small number of voters can make more of a difference. People often vote tactically in relatively safe seats too.Since it is not always clear what order the parties are going to come in, some voters make mistakes and vote tactically the wrong way - that is, for a party that ends up doing worse than the voter's preferred party. Typically though, people are more likely to vote tactically the clearer it is that their preferred party is out of contention.In the 1990s, after the Conservatives had been in power for over a decade, Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters were often willing to vote tactically for each other depending on who was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This reached a high point in 1997 when tactical voting was estimated to have cost the Conservatives around 46 seats, with Labour taking 35 and the Liberal Democrats 11 of them. However, if tactical voting fails to happen in large enough numbers, it doesn't make a difference. At the 2015 election, shortly after the Scottish independence referendum, there was an attempt to co-ordinate anti-nationalist tactical voting among opponents of the Scottish National Party (SNP). It even involved Conservative supporters voting Labour. It almost certainly saved Labour from a total wipe-out in Scotland, securing their one remaining seat north of the border that year. But it was not enough to stop the SNP from winning nearly all the seats (56 out of 59) with just less than half the overall vote in Scotland.Tactical voting in the 2019 general election is likely to be shaped mainly by divisions over Brexit, even more so than it was in 2017. Among Leave supporters, tactical voting is likely to come into play in constituencies where the Brexit Party and the Conservatives are competing to take a seat from a party that is sympathetic to another referendum (the Brexit Party has already stood down its candidates in seats that the Conservatives won last time).The Conservatives' message - ""get Brexit done"" - is aimed partly at encouraging Brexit Party supporters to use their vote tactically in seats where the Conservatives have a better chance of winning (that is, most, if not all, of them). Tactical voting among Remain supporters is much more complicated because it involves more parties, with varying Brexit policies. The Lib Dems the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are all pro-Remain. The Labour Party is in favour of a referendum but has not committed to supporting Remain or Leave.Pro-Remain parties also disagree on other issues, and they do not always say nice things about each other's party leaders. For all of these reasons, many supporters of these parties are not keen on switching tactically in favour of one of the others.It is often difficult to identify Remain candidates best placed to win seats from Conservatives. This is because different pro-Remain parties did well in different places at the last general election. What's more, there have been big changes in the opinion polls since 2017. On average in the polls, the Labour vote has dropped by 10 percentage points since the last election, while the Lib Dem vote has increased by six points. This suggests the Lib Dems may have overtaken Labour in as many as 55 of the 273 seats where Conservatives are defending and Labour came second last time.    At this and previous elections there have been constituency polls to guide people in some high profile places. Now there are also sophisticated statistical models of polling data attempting to show how support for the parties stands in every constituency. These models have been used by campaign groups to set up websites encouraging people to vote tactically for particular parties in particular constituencies. Some go so far as to organise vote swapping - matching people from different constituencies so they can both vote tactically, knowing that someone somewhere else will be voting for their preferred party.Tactical voting websites largely agree on which pro-Remain parties are best placed to win in which constituencies, but they do not entirely agree. There have also been changes in public opinion since those websites were set up, and there might well be further changes before election day. And, of course, all polls and forecasts may be inaccurate. So tactical voting websites cannot be entirely relied on. Voters have to form their own judgements as to whom they want to vote for and why.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Stephen Fisher is associate professor in political sociology and a fellow of Trinity College, OxfordEdited by Ben Milne"
Labour 'beats other parties on climate change',https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50692435,"Labour has the strongest policies to protect nature and combat climate change, a Friends of the Earth (FoE) survey suggests.Its election pledges narrowly beat the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats – with the Conservatives far behind.One key climate policy area is aviation, and Labour has now announced plans for a levy on people who take frequent flights.The FoE league table marks the parties on 45 policy points. The environmental campaign group's scores are:FoE spokesman Dave Timms said: ""Environmental issues have been given greater priority in this election than ever before – and with the world in the midst of an ecological and climate crisis this must be the next government’s top priority. “Many of the policies that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Green Party have put forward are commensurate with, or striving to meet, the challenges we face. “It is disappointing we have not seen the same urgency, ambition or consistency from the Conservative Party.”The result will be a shock to the Green Party, whose overriding concern is protecting the planet and who typically top the environment policy charts by a wide margin. The Greens complained the scoring should only have included commitments made in manifestos. But in a bid for the youth vote, Labour has challenged the Greens by devoting the top section of its manifesto to tackling the environment crisis. One high-scoring policy in the FoE survey is on aviation. Labour has been under pressure from trades unions to safeguard jobs in the industry.But after correspondence with Friends of the Earth, the party strengthened its position by backing a frequent flyer levy on the 15% of people who take 70% of flights.A letter to the group from four Labour shadow cabinet ministers also promised to review its Aviation National Policy Statement against much tougher carbon targets.What about Heathrow?Labour said expansion at Heathrow would be cancelled if it was not consistent with climate targets. A Labour government would also divert funds from the roads programme for public transport, the party says.The Greens did not provide any more clarification or policies to strengthen their manifesto.Mr Timms said: ""Labour’s manifesto contains strong, funded policies on home energy efficiency and renewables. This was boosted by significant additional pledges during the campaign on plans for tree planting, food policy, public transport and cycling.""The Lib Dems and Greens both scored well, and had policies roughly commensurate with the scale of the crisis."" He added: “The Conservatives have some good policies  - especially on agriculture – but in sector after sector its commitments were invariably weaker than the other parties', entirely absent or just plain bad.”The Conservatives are committed to a £28.8bn road-building programme that experts say is not compatible with carbon targets because, even if the cars of the future are electric, gathering the resources to make the cars will still generate emissions.The Tories said their climate targets were world-leading but road congestion had to be tackled.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
Are political clubs still political?,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50586758,"On a street in the Nottinghamshire town of Arnold, there is a Liberal club, a Labour club and a Conservative club, all within a five-minute walk of one another. But how much do the people who patronise these establishments actually care about politics?There's an intense silence among the members of Arnold's Balfour Conservative Club as the president calls out numbers. That's because Wednesday night is bingo night - and bingo night is taken seriously. Certainly more seriously than politics.In the lull between the rounds, 82-year-old Shirley Wilmot, who has always voted Labour, says she's never really thought about the club's Conservative connections.""I'm a member of the Liberal club and the Labour club as well,"" she says. ""But this is my favourite because it's so friendly.""I go to the Liberal on a Saturday because they have two artists on, here on the Wednesday for the bingo and the Labour club on Sunday for the dinner. They're not political places.""Just down the road at the Arnold Labour Club, president John Wood, 60, would agree with that sentiment.He says its link to the party ended about 10 years ago and that the association had become ""damaging"". He is even looking to change the club's name.Of the nine people asked at the Labour club, not one could say they would definitely vote for the Labour Party, and a few know they certainly will not.Among them is Ann Rogers, 50, a member of a motorbike group which meets there weekly.""I come for the friendly people and the amazing bar staff,"" she says.

It's hard for me but I feel they've let us down, and I don't like Jeremy Corbyn.""Mr Wood says the club and local party used to support one another financially and political meetings were once held here. But he understands they went their separate ways well before he took over two years ago.He says some of his regulars refuse to become full club members because of the name and he has even been denied loans from banks and grants for renovation work because of the perceived political ties.""I couldn't be tied to any party,"" Mr Wood says. ""The only one I've ever supported is UKIP. But I don't get involved and we never talk politics.""Instead, they host events ranging from coffee mornings for the elderly and a Parkinson's support group, to weddings and weekly discos.Inside are four rooms, each with its own bar. One room is dominated by a snooker table, and another has a skittles alley where members sometimes play against members of the Conservative club and the Liberal club - although the rivalry isn't fuelled by differing political allegiances.One of the team members is 27-year-old handyman Alex Hunt. Snooker cue in hand, he says: ""I love the company, all my friends are here, it's lively and you can drink.""I used to be a member of the Liberal and Conservative club but they don't have the same atmosphere.""And what about politics?""I've not got a clue who I'm voting for this election,"" he says. ""I don't know anything about politics. It just doesn't matter to me.""The club's bar manager, Paula Martin, says she gets a call about twice a month from people asking to speak to the local Labour candidate. A man came in a couple of weeks ago asking why there were no pictures at the club of the candidate, she says.""I told him it's just not like that any more.""In the Conservative club, there's also an absence of political chat and certainly no division along party lines.Indeed, a number of the Labour club's members and some of its bar staff are here to play ""sticky 13s"", a form of card bingo popular in Nottingham pubs.Unlike its Labour counterpart, the Balfour Conservative Club is still affiliated to the political party and pays an annual subscription to the Association of Conservative Clubs. Its rules state that every member should also be a member or supporter of the Conservative Party, but the secretary admits this is not something that is enforced these days.The same rulebook's stated aim is to ""promote the principles of Conservatism and the implementation of the Conservative Party's policies"", although this does not seem to go much further than hosting a few party meetings and a Christmas meal.The blue interior and a portrait of the early 20th Century prime minister Arthur Balfour suggest a Tory heritage - but one club member sitting below a picture of the Queen admits he now supports the Brexit Party.Club president Rob Whalley, 66, says the strength of its association with the Conservatives has weakened in the five decades he has been coming here.As he prepares to set up the bingo, he says: ""I don't talk politics at the club. The days when you were a member of just one of the political clubs are done. If we said you had to be a Conservative Party member to join, we'd have no-one in.""For the members, the subsidised pints, the friendly atmosphere, the snooker and pool tables seem to be the main draw.That's certainly the case for Labour supporter Andy Gallagher, who has come here for a game. ""This is the most convenient pool table - I don't care what the place is called,"" he says. ""I know I'm not the only Labour voter but we never discuss politics.""If Boris Johnson walked in here I wouldn't talk to him but I'd not tell him to get out either.""Back at the Labour club, 37-year-old industrial truck driver Tony Barnsley says he's been a member for the past four years, because the staff ""treat him well"" and ""pull a great pint of Stella"".But he has only voted once in his life, almost 20 years ago. ""If anyone tries to talk politics they walk out because no-one is bothered; they won't even listen to it,"" he says.""If Jeremy Corbyn walked in here I'd say 'get me a drink'."""

UKIP launches 'Brexit and beyond' manifesto,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50628082,"The UK Independence Party has launched a ""Brexit and beyond"" manifesto with a commitment to leaving the EU on 31 January 2020 without a deal.Interim leader Pat Mountain said the PM's withdrawal agreement would keep the UK ""shackled to Brussels"".The party also wants to cut net immigration to below 10,000 per year.It is standing in 44 seats across the UK  - a substantially reduced number from the 378 candidates they stood in 2017.Speaking to Sky News, Ms Mountain said the number of candidates had been ""carefully chosen"" in order not to ""do any damage to any actual Brexiter"".Writing in the manifesto, she said UKIP was ""the party of Brexit and beyond"".""We are proud to have developed a full common-sense manifesto which combines our founding libertarian principles with populism and authentic conservatism. ""In particular, we stand for free speech, free markets, financial responsibility and traditional British values.""On Brexit, the party says it stands for ""a complete and total withdrawal from the European Union"" including leaving the single market and the customs union. The party's manifesto also includes promises to:Speaking at the manifesto launch in central London, Ms Mountain said: ""We are realists, we know that we are not going to be in Number 10 Downing Street.""But we want to send a message - the message that there is still a party in this country that can't be bought, that can't be pressurised into silence.""We are here for all those who have been let down and betrayed by our politicians in Westminster."" The party has experienced a period of turmoil since winning the highest number of seats in the 2014 European elections.In October, Richard Braine resigned as party leader blaming ""internal conflict"" - making him UKIP's eighth different leader since the Brexit referendum in 2016.

Sajid Javid EU trade deal claim fact-checked,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50673131,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid has said there was not ""a single doubt"" in his mind that the UK would ""have agreed and finalised a very ambitious deep and comprehensive trade deal"" with the European Union (EU) before the end of next year. That's when a post-Brexit transition period is due to come to an end.""""Because there's already an agreement, there's already an agreement in principle. It's there,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But this is not the case. What the UK has agreed is the political declaration - a non-binding document setting out the broad direction of travel for negotiations with the EU after Brexit.That document says both sides want ""an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic co-operation"", based on ""a balance of rights and obligations"".But the precise details still have to be negotiated.And while ""Get Brexit Done"" may be a good campaign slogan, slogans don't make trade agreements. Trade agreements are made by tough decisions, technical negotiations and trade-offs. It's not the same thing.Mr Javid said that since Boris Johnson became prime minister the UK had not only negotiated a revised withdrawal agreement with the EU, but had also ""negotiated… the outline of a trade agreement"".In fact, the EU is not allowed by law to conduct any formal negotiations on a trade deal until after the UK has left. And if Brexit does happen on 31 January, the other 27 EU countries would then need to approve a joint negotiating mandate. That's a process which could take about six weeks, if things go well. So it is unlikely that formal trade negotiations would begin until about mid-March, leaving very little time to discuss the detail. Ratifying any agreement before the end of next year would take several months, so the negotiations themselves would need to be completed by the summer. Trade deals normally take several years to negotiate.The government argues that its deal with the EU is different from other deals because the two sides are already fully aligned when it comes to rules and regulations. That is true - and neither side has an interest in dragging things out. A lot of preparatory work has been done. But a basic rule of trade agreements is it's not about where you start, it's about where you want to end up. The UK has made clear that it wants to diverge from EU rules, which will make it more difficult to get a trade agreement done quickly. Both sides have talked about a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" deal for goods, meaning no extra taxes on imports or limits to how much you can buy and sell from each other. But the EU will be seeking guarantees that the UK intends to respect what are known as ""level-playing-field"" measures on things like workers' rights and environmental regulations. That's the idea that countries keep their rules and standards closely aligned, to stop one country giving their businesses a competitive advantage - for example by having lower standards and so lower costs.Alongside a deal on goods, there's also the question of services - a huge part of the UK economy - which could take longer to resolve. So a key question for the UK is how it intends to maintain full market access to the EU - its largest trading partner - while also moving away from the current rules of the game. Any number of issues could hold things up. It's also important to point out that post-Brexit arrangements are not just about trade - they're about security, immigration, fishing, educational programmes, data-sharing and so on. There are all sorts of things that the government is promising to sort out in record time. So it is an incredibly ambitious timetable, with no guarantee that it can all be done before the end of next year. And it's worth remembering that if trade talks are not completed by December 2020, when the transition period ends, there is the prospect of the UK having no formal trade agreement with the EU at all. The transition could in theory be extended by one or two years, but Boris Johnson has insisted that there will be no extension. Government ministers have been asked repeatedly during this election campaign whether they will rule out leaving with no deal at the end of 2020, but none has been prepared to make that commitment. Instead they are following the Prime Minister's lead and insisting that everything will be done on schedule. ""If you say, can you absolutely guarantee we'll get a deal,"" Mr Johnson said at a campaign event today, ""I think I can.""What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Labour seeks to keep focus on NHS,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50715345,"Labour claims NHS under-funding is putting patients at risk and the Tories are warning about a hung parliament, as the election enters its final stretch.With two days to go, Labour is pledging a ""relentless focus"" on the health service if it wins power.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try to keep the focus on Brexit and the ""danger"" of another hung Parliament. In a speech later, he will pledge that the Tories would ""smash through the gridlock"" if given a majority. The Conservatives are also attacking Labour over the costs of delivering and running new government agencies promised in the party's manifesto.It comes after Mr Johnson faced criticism on Monday over his response to an image of a sick four-year-old boy who had to sleep on the floor of a hospital.In other election developments:Labour says reports produced by NHS trusts in England this month show a health service ""in crisis and on the brink"". The party says an analysis it has conducted of more than 120 NHS trust board papers identified hundreds of risks to patient safety classed as ""catastrophic"" or ""extreme"".The majority were linked to spending, staff shortages or failures of privatisation, the party said. It promised that a Labour government would conduct an immediate audit of the risks revealed.The BBC's Reality Check team said the quotes from the NHS boards were genuine but did not give the nationwide picture, which was more mixed.Labour said the backlog of maintenance in the NHS is £6.5bn, of which £1.1bn is for ""high-risk"" repairs.Its analysis also found there were 15,844 patient incidents ""directly"" linked to NHS buildings and facilities, as well as 4,810 clinical incidents caused by building and infrastructure failure.And it said there were 1,541 fires recorded by NHS trusts in 2018-19, with 34 people injured.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These shocking reports reveal an NHS in crisis and on the brink.""We pledge that within the first 100 days of a Labour government we will get on top of this to ensure the extra funding we've promised is prioritised to keep patients and staff safe.""For the Conservatives, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the party was embarking on the ""largest"" hospital building programmes in UK history, although there is controversy about its pledge to build 40 new hospitals. Elsewhere, Mr Johnson will use a speech later to warn there is a ""clear and present"" danger of another hung parliament if voters do not turn out to support the Conservatives on Thursday.On a campaign visit to Staffordshire, he will tell supporters there are ""well-financed"" efforts to prevent a Tory majority through tactical voting, with just 12 gains by opposition parties enough to make Mr Corbyn prime minister.""On the other hand, the Conservatives need only nine more seats for a majority. ""We could finally get Brexit done, end the uncertainty and move on,"" he will say."
