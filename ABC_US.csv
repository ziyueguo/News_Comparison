Police want motorists' video of UPS truck shooting,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/investigators-motorists-videos-ups-truck-shooting-67596040,"
Family and friends honored on Monday a UPS driver who was killed in a         shootout between Florida police and the robbery suspects who had hijacked his delivery truck. 
Loved ones filed by Frank Ordonez's open casket at a Miami funeral home to pay respects to the 27-year-old driver. Some UPS employees showed up in the brown company uniform to express condolences to Ordonez's family. Other UPS drivers pulled their delivery trucks over beside the road to observe a minute of silence for their coworker, according to the union Teamsters Local 769.
On Sunday night at a UPS Customer Center, relatives and friends gathered for a vigil, lit candles and wrote messages on UPS slips they stuck to a car. UPS workers abroad have also joined in to express support— one group from London         tweeted  a photo showing uniformed workers holding up letters that together spelled #ONE UPS and RIP Frank Ordonez.
More than a dozen officers from four agencies had converged Thursday on the UPS truck at a busy South Florida intersection during rush hour, taking cover behind the vehicles of people stopped at a red light amid bursts of gunfire. The 27-year-old UPS driver and another motorist stopped at the light, Richard Cutshaw, were killed along with the suspects. 
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement appealed Monday for anyone who witnessed or has video of the shootout between police and the hijackers of a UPS truck to contact the agency.
The shooting is being investigated by the state agency in part because it involved four police agencies and more than a dozen officers. 
The chase began after a jewelry store robbery in Coral Gables, where a woman was struck in the head by a ricocheting bullet. Authorities said 41-year-old cousins Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill fled the store, hijacked Ordonez's UPS truck and led police on a chase on Interstate 75. The truck got off the interstate and drove into Miramar before getting stuck at a busy intersection.
The chase and final shootout were broadcast live on television, including the moment when one of the men tumbled out of the truck, mortally wounded. News coverage included videos taken by motorists.

"UPS driver, bystander, suspects identified from Florida shootout that left 4 dead",https://abcnews.go.com/US/witnesses-describe-shootout-left-dead-theft-ups-truck/story?id=67543974,"
An attempted jewelry store robbery that led to the theft of a UPS truck, a hostage situation and a police shootout that ultimately left two ""innocent civilians,"" including a UPS driver, dead has shaken the Florida community to its core.

UPS identified the driver as Frank Ordonez, according to a statement obtained by ABC News on Friday.

He'd had worked with the company since July 2016, first as a package handler and then as a service provider, also known as a driver.
""We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends and the other innocent victims involved in this incident,"" UPS said in the statement.
The incident started around 4:15 p.m. local time when two men attempted to rob Regent Jewelers in Coral Gables, authorities said. After shots were fired, the suspects carjacked the UPS truck, held the driver, Ordonez, hostage and led police on a high-speed pursuit before engaging in a shootout.

The two suspects, identified by the FBI as Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, both of Miami-Dade County, were killed in the shootout, FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro told reporters.The FBI identifies the two deceased individuals responsible for yesterday's jewelry store robbery, carjacking/kidnapping and shootings as Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, both of Miami-Dade County. If anyone has information about these crimes, call 1-855-352-7233— FBI Miami (@FBIMiamiFL) December 6, 2019 The FBI identifies the two deceased individuals responsible for yesterday's jewelry store robbery, carjacking/kidnapping and shootings as Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, both of Miami-Dade County. If anyone has information about these crimes, call 1-855-352-7233
Two ""innocent civilians,"" Ordonez and a bystander, were killed amid gunfire, Piro said. Family members told ABC News that Richard Cutshaw, a 70-year-old union representative, was the bystander shot and killed.
It's not yet clear whether the two died from gunfire by law enforcement or the suspects.

Alex Melo, a witness, told ABC News he has been ""nervous beyond belief"" since seeing the incident unfold.

""You have chills in your body seeing the scene. … It's not something, an ordeal, you live through on a daily basis,"" Melo said Friday morning.

Melo was in a car with Sheila Cabrera when the two said they were stuck in an intersection of the highway in Miramar as the shootout erupted during rush hour Thursday afternoon.

As the shootout broke out, Cabrera said she and Melo ""could not move"" from their car.
""Next thing you know, we were in the middle of it all,"" she told ABC News. ""All I could think of was a stray bullet coming towards us.""

She described seeing ""a river of police"" flooding the highway in pursuit of the UPS truck.
Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam called the deadly incident an ""unprecedented event that took place in our quiet community.""

Messam said authorities are still gathering information, with the FBI taking the lead in the case and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also investigating.
Joe Merino, the stepfather of Ordonez, told ABC News the family is looking for answers as to exactly what happened and condemned what he called ""excessive force"" by the police.

""Officers are here to serve and protect. Well, where was the protection offered of my son? Where was his protection?"" Merino said. ""He was a victim. He was a hostage.""

He called Ordonez's death ""avoidable.""

""It could've been handled differently,"" Merino said.

Ordonez leaves behind two daughters, ages 3 and 5. Cutshaw leaves behind his 99-year-old mother and five brothers and sisters.

Shooting that left 6 dead was 'targeted' at Jewish deli: Officials,https://abcnews.go.com/US/video-shows-deadly-attack-jewish-deli-jersey-targeted/story?id=67652504,"
Security video confirms that a police shootout in Jersey City, New Jersey, with a pair of rifle-wielding suspects who allegedly killed a detective and three others was part of a rapid series of crimes, including a deliberate attack on a Jewish deli, authorities said.

Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn, a Satmar Hasidic group, said that two of the victims killed in the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket were Orthodox Jewish. He identified them as 33-year-old Mindel Ferencz, the wife of the deli owner and mother of five, and 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch, a Yeshiva student.

Deutsch's father, Abe Deutsch, is a member of the United Jewish Organization's board of directors, Niederman said in a statement.

The third victim was Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, according to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal and family members.
""Based on everything ... we know, there is no ongoing security concern,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.

During a White House Hanukkah ceremony on Wednesday in which he signed an executive order combating anti-Semitism, President Donald Trump called the suspects in the Jersey City shooting ""two wicked murderers.""

Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and James Shea, the city's director of public safety, said security footage ""clearly"" shows the perpetrators, who were shot to death by police after an hours-long gunfight, were out to kill people inside the market.

While Grewel and other authorities were hesitant to call the attack on the supermarket a hate crime, Fulop said on Wednesday that ""there is no question this is a hate crime.""

An operable explosive was found in the back of a stolen U-Haul van the suspects parked in front of the store, said Gregory Ehrie, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark, New Jersey, field office. It remains unclear what the suspects intended to do with the device, which was taken to an FBI laboratory for analysis.

""It was a viable device, meaning it could be a device that would have exploded,"" Ehrie said. ""It was a pipe bomb design, not complicated but sophisticated in the sense that time and effort went into creating it.""
Notes and religious writings also were discovered in the van, the officials told ABC News.

Grewel, whose office is leading the investigation, added that digital and documentary evidence was discovered in the van, which is being reviewed by investigators ""for indications about the suspects' possible motives.""

A law enforcement official briefed on the probe told ABC News at least one of the suspects had recently posted anti-Semitic statements online.

The suspects were identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, Grewel said.

Both Anderson and Graham are believed to be followers of the Black Israelites, a group that espouses hatred toward Jews and is known for anti-government and anti-police sentiments, sources told ABC News.

Authorities are preliminarily investigating the incident as a case of domestic terrorism, sources said.

Anderson had a prior criminal record for weapons offenses, stemming from incidents in 2004, 2007 and 2011, according to the New Jersey Department of Corrections.

Graham has been described as a former home-health aide who met Anderson after she got hurt at work and left her job, sources told ABC News. Neighbors of the pair claimed that Anderson turned Graham into a ""dark person.""

The terrifying episode began to unfold about 12:38 p.m. on Tuesday, when the Jersey City Police Department received a 911 call from an individual who discovered the body of Jersey City Det. Joseph Seals in the Bayview Cemetery, about a mile from the kosher market, Grewel said.
He said investigators believe Seals was shot to death when he confronted the suspects in the cemetery. He said Anderson and Graham were prime suspects in the murder this past weekend of an Uber driver officials identified as Michael Rumberger.

Rumberger's body was found in the trunk of a Lincoln Town car around 10 p.m. Saturday, sources told ABC News.

Seals, a plainclothes undercover detective, had been investigating the homicide, according to law enforcement sources.

After allegedly killing Seals in the cemetery, the suspects got into the stolen U-Haul van and drove to the kosher market, arriving about 12:43 p.m., Grewel said.

He said security video captured the suspects parking directly across the street from the supermarket on Martin Luther King Drive.

""Within seconds of arriving, Mr. Anderson exited the driver's side door of the U-Haul with a rifle in his hand,"" Grewel said. ""He walked toward the JC Kosher Supermarket and immediately began shooting. Ms. Graham, the passenger in the van, followed Mr. Anderson into the store. From that point on until the conclusion of the event, the two suspects remained inside the store.""

Grewel said four people, including the three slain victims, were inside the store when the suspects stormed through the front door. A fourth who was shot and wounded managed to escape, Grewel said.
Fulop, who viewed the security video, said the footage showed the van the suspects were in moving slowly through the streets of Jersey City before it reached the supermarket.

""The perpetrators stopped in front of there, calmly opened the door with two long rifles ... and began firing from the street into the facility,"" Fulop said.
Shea added, ""With the amount of ammunition they had, we have to assume they would have continued attacking human beings if we hadn't been there.""
Two foot-patrol officers were about a block from the deli, Shea said, and responded as soon as they heard the gunfire.

They ""heroically placed themselves in the line of fire attempting to give the information, and both of them received gunshot wounds,"" Shea said. ""Having had an opportunity to go through the video overnight, we now know this did not begin with gunfire between police officers and the perpetrators and then move to the store. It began with an attack on civilians in the store.""
Numerous shots were fired at the store, and Shea noted it occurred at a time the streets of downtown Jersey City were packed with people and nearby schools, which were placed on lockdown, were full of students.

During the shootout, at least one bullet pierced a window at the Sacred Heart School across the street from the kosher market, but no one at the school was injured.

""There were multiple other people on the streets, so there were many other targets available to them that they bypassed to attack that place,"" Shea said of the suspects. ""That was their target and they intended to harm people inside there.""
Shea said that within seconds, more Jersey City police officers responded, pulled their two wounded colleagues out of the line of fire and continued to engage the armed suspects inside the store. Both were killed in the shootout, police said.
Grewel said the gunbattle lasted until about 3:47 p.m., when a police armored vehicle broke through the entryway of the supermarket and police found the bodies of the suspects and the three victims inside.

""We're not in a position at this time to say definitively why the suspects decided to stop at the market and begin firing immediately,"" Grewel said.

In addition to the two other officers wounded in the shootout, a third was hurt by shrapnel, officials said. The officers were all treated at a hospital and released.

Seals was the department's ""leading police officer for removing guns from the street,"" Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly said Tuesday night.

He's survived by a wife and five children, Fulop told reporters. Seals had been with the department since 2006 and recently had been promoted to detective.

Craig Carpenito, U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey, warned that just hours after the shooting, scam artists attempted to capitalize on the tragedy.

""I can't believe what I'm about to say, but on top of the tragedy yesterday, we found out last night that a reprehensible group of people are online trying to profiteer off the misfortune of others and they are creating fake GoFundMe pages to try to solicit donations purportedly for the families of these victims,"" Carpenito said
""I can't find the words of how disgusting this conduct is. What I can tell you is we're looking at it, we're investigating it,"" he said, asking anyone with information about the scam or who donated to the bogus pages to contact the FBI immediately.
The shooting prompted New York Gov. Andrew Coumo to direct state police to boost patrols near synagogues and Jewish establishments in the state.

""We now know that this disgusting act of violence was a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Jersey City,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""Anti-Semitism and violence against the Jewish community are on the rise both in our state and across the nation. We must stand united, be vigilant and stamp out this vile disease of hate wherever we see it. New York is a proud home to the Jewish community and we will continue to reject hateful acts whenever and wherever we see them.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed the governor's statement at a City Hall news conference with Rabbi Niederman and other Jewish leaders.

""The violence has reached the doorstep of New York City,"" de Blasio said, ""and we have to take that as a warning sign.""

'Start Here': House report on Trump impeachment and Harris suspends 2020 campaign,https://abcnews.go.com/US/start-here-house-report-trump-impeachment-kamala-harris-suspends/story?id=67470297,"
It's Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2019. Let's start here.

1. Impeachment report

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have released their impeachment report, accusing President Donald Trump of a “scheme” involving pressuring Ukraine for his own personal and political gain, and obstructing Congress by instructing the White House to stonewall the inquiry.

On today's ""Start Here,"" ABC News Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran talks about the case laid out by Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in releasing the report, ""This was his moment, it felt like, to try his best to communicate what he believes is the very tremendous gravity of the charges against the president and the impact it would have on the rule of law and our democracy going forward if the president was allowed to just walk away from the conduct that Schiff believes the evidence shows he engaged in.""Rep. Adam Schiff: ""Americans should care deeply about whether the president of the United States is betraying...that oath that he took to the Constitution."" ""If we don't care about this, we can darn well be sure the president will be back at it."" https://t.co/YNslsSpPLT pic.twitter.com/twJ1S2eP1i
In a separate report, Republicans on the committee argue there's no evidence that the president acted to help his own re-election. Trump, overseas in London for the NATO summit, blasted Schiff and Democrats, insisting, ""I did nothing wrong.""

The impeachment inquiry enters a new phase today with the House Judiciary Committee holding its first public hearing. The White House has rejected Democrats’ offer to participate.

2. Harris suspends campaign

In a major shake-up in the 2020 race, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has suspended her presidential run amid reports that her campaign was in turmoil.It has been the honor of my life to be your candidate. We will keep up the fight. pic.twitter.com/RpZhx3PENl
There are now 15 candidates in the running for the Democratic nomination, and now with Harris dropping out of the race, the remaining six hopefuls who have qualified for this month's debate are all white, FiveThirtyEight Editor-in-Chief Nate Silver notes on the podcast.

""I think you're going to start seeing a round of stories about how is this process working,"" he says. ""Is the process going well when candidates like Kamala Harris drop out two months before Iowa votes, and then you have [Mike] Bloomberg and [Tom] Steyer kind of crashing, so to speak, the party.""
3. Trade tensions

There are new trade tensions between the U.S. and France as the Trump administration threatens tariffs on $2.4 billion in French imports in retaliation for France's taxes on U.S. tech companies.

In a photo op on Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump downplayed the dispute and predicted, ""I think we’ll probably be able to work it out.""

But Wall Street slumped as investors reacted to the president's comments about waiting until after the 2020 election to make a trade deal with China, according to ABC News White House Correspondent Karen Travers in London.

""[Trump] says he's more than willing to wait this out and not settle for something, but the Chinese say well we're the ones that don't have a re-election next year, so the pressure is more on President Trump,"" she tells the podcast.

Boy's relative left him on the road because he thought the boy was gay: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/boys-relative-abandoned-side-road-thought-boy-gay/story?id=67470248,"
A Florida man has been charged with negligent child abuse after police said he dumped a boy, who he is related to, on the side of the road because he ""thinks that [the boy] is gay.""

Evenaud Julmeus, 30, of Haines City, was arrested Monday after local police found the boy alone in front of the Haines City Police Department, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by ABC News.

Julmeus allegedly told the boy before leaving him that ""the police will find you a new home.""
The two allegedly got into a verbal argument over the boy's sexuality when Julmeus found gay pornography on his phone.

Julmeus ""became very upset,"" according to the affidavit.
He told the boy to get in the car and pack a bag, which the boy did, the affidavit read.
Julmeus then allegedly took the boy to the Haines City Police Department, where he is said to have dropped him off on the side of the road in front of the building before heading back home.

Detectives noted that the boy ""did not have any food, water or money"" or a phone to contact anyone, according to the affidavit.

Police said in the affidavit that the boy's mother rushed to pick him up when Julmeus returned to their home without him and said the boy was at the police station.

A spokesman for Haines City police told ABC News that they would not detail the relationship between the boy because he is a minor and they want to protect his identity.
When authorities went to the home to find Julmeus, they found he was not there and left two other minors without adult supervision.

Julmeus is facing three counts of negligent child abuse. Calls to Julmeus were not returned and it was not immediately clear if he had yet obtained legal representation.

School crowns all-girls chess team at pep rally after big win at state championship,https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-crowns-girls-chicago-chess-team-pep-rally/story?id=67552484,"
A group of three eighth grade girls brought home a big win during an Illinois state chess tournament.

And to celebrate, their classmates made more noise than you would ever expect for competitors in a chess tournament -- at a pep rally.
With families and friends alike, Shakira Luster, 13, Trechelle Williams, 14, and Imani Hill, 14, ruled the halls of St. Ethelreda School, on the South Side of Chicago.

Together, they took the third, fourth and 10th places at November's Illinois State All Grade Chess Championship.
""The pep rally was very empowering because we could see how our fellow classmates are looking up to us, believing in us and celebrating us for winning,"" Imani said in excitement.

While this deserved win was more than enough reason to celebrate, chess holds a special place in the experiences for the students at St. Ethelreda School.
Eric Luster, the chess coach and a math teacher at St. Ethelreda, as well as Shakira's father, has a longtime love of the game.

""As a casual chess player myself -- and looking at the research on how chess can help improve students' math scores -- I wanted to create a chess team here at the school,"" Luster told ABC News. ""We've been playing chess here for over seven years now, and we have definitely seen an improvement in math scores and an overall growth in academic performance, particularly for the students who participated in the team.""

In those past seven years, the chess team has grown to become a source of community and fun for students.
""There is something about being a member of the chess team here. You might not be an athlete, you might not be the smartest kid in the classroom, but you're still on the team,"" said Dr. Denise Spells, principal of St. Ethelreda School. ""You get on the bus to go to your tournaments. You come in your T-shirts ready to play. We, as a school, win a trophy and everybody is happy. It's our own little community.""

Although St. Ethelreda School has collected a fair amount of trophies, these state wins have been historic.
""First off, we're talking all girls -- that hasn't happened in the state's history that just a group of all girls went as a team and won the state championship,"" Luster said. ""Second, we're talking about a group of African American girls, and I don't think that's happened in the state's history either.""
""We always thought we were the best eighth grade team, but when we actually won, it felt empowering to know that we made history,"" Trechelle said.

Spells wanted to do something big for the girls to show them how proud the entire school was of them, she said. As Shakira, Trechelle and Imani walked through the hallways of St. Ethelreda School, they were crowned alongside Luster, their coach, to make them feel like kings and queens of the school.
""Because the chessboard is ruled by the king, and the most important piece is the queen, they decided to crown us at the pep rally -- which surprised us because we were not expecting it,"" Luster said.

Winning at the state championships, in many ways, is really just the beginning for these girls.

""Being on the chess team means a lot to me because it has helped out with my math and test scores a lot,"" Shakira said. ""So the more I play chess, the more I feel like my scores are going up.""

And to that, checkmate. "
Jewish deli shooting survivor describes escape,https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-jewish-deli-shooting-lone-survivor-describes-harrowing/story?id=67698070,"
As bullets whizzed by within inches of him, David Lax said he dove to the floor of a Jewish deli in Jersey City, New Jersey, and when two suspected killers dressed in black barged through the door with guns blazing, he thought his life was about to end.

""I'm just thankful that I lived to see another day,"" Lax told ABC News on Thursday, two days after a man and a woman committed what authorities described as an act of domestic terrorism at the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket, fatally shooting three people before police killed them in a hail of gunfire.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said that the suspects were apparently motivated by sentiments of ""anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement"" and targeted the market shortly after killing a Jersey City police detective, Joseph Seals, 39, the married father of five children, in a nearby cemetery.

Lax said he was at the market about 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, picking up some lunch when he suddenly heard ""a lot of big bangs.""
He said it took him a moment to realize the noise was gunfire.

Lax said that when the attack commenced, he was standing near the front door of the store near the salad bar.

""I thought it's over,"" he said of his life. ""I mean, bullets flying all over.""

Investigators identified the shooters as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.
""They came to kill, and they didn’t come to spare anyone,"" Lax said.

Lax and three other people, including two workers and another customer, were inside the store when the attack began. He was the only one to make it out alive.

He said he dove to the floor as the male gunman, Anderson, wielding what authorities described as an AR-15 style rifle, stormed in firing.

""Like everyone, I jumped on the floor,"" Lax said.

As he tried to hide, one of the shooters dressed in a black raincoat walked by him.
He said that as the gunman passed, he stood up only to come face-to-face with the second assailant, Graham, who authorities said was holding a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun.

Lax said that as Graham swung the barrel of the gun toward him, he managed to push the weapon away and made a beeline for the front door.

""I thank God I had the courage, I had the right mind,"" Lax said. ""I just re-directed her arm and ran out of the store.""

He said he ran as fast as he could in a zigzag pattern, dodging the shots being fired at his back.

Lax said that once he made it outside to the street, he encountered a child near a neighboring synagogue.
""He’s very brave, very smart,"" he said of the child, who appeared to be alone. ""We met like on the corner of the street. I was running faster than him, so I passed by him and then I was turning around and I saw him. He started talking to me, so I said, 'You know what, you’re coming with me. So that’s basically it.""

Killed inside the store were 33-year-old Mindy Ferencz, the wife of the kosher supermarket owner and mother of five, and 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch, a Yeshiva student. Also shot dead was Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, who worked at the store.
Lax said that when the shooting started, Ferencz was sitting near the cash register, while Rodriguez was in the back of the store. Authorities described Deutsch as a customer.
Lax said that after he and the child were out of harm's way, police arrived on scene and a massive gunbattle erupted.

Grewal said Thursday that ""several hundred"" shell casings were found at the scene.
Anderson and Graham were both shot to death in an hourslong gunfight with police.

""Obviously, it’s just a miracle ... because as far as I know, it’s hard to miss with a shotgun at such a close range,"" Lax said of surviving the attack. "
New York City dumping homeless to New Jersey to live in decrepit buildings: Lawsuit,https://abcnews.go.com/US/york-city-dumping-homeless-jersey-live-decrepit-buildings/story?id=67458182,"
A program designed to help curb homelessness in New York City has turned Newark, New Jersey, and surrounding area into a dumping ground for needy families, according to a new lawsuit.

People who had been in shelters are being placed in uninhabitable or illegal apartments, some with no heat or electricity, some with crumbling ceilings and floors, the suit, filed at the behest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, alleges.

The suit, filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accused New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Steven Banks, commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, of orchestrating an ""ill-conceived, surreptitious"" program that's become a public nuisance.
The lawsuit contends New York's Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, has ""unlawfully coerced"" people into leaving the city's shelters for dilapidated, rodent-invested housing in neighboring communities.
Under SOTA, launched by the de Blasio administration in August 2017, the city offers families that have been in shelters for at least 90 days housing subsidies for up a year as long as the heads of households work and earn income for future rental payments.

But participants of the program have said the subsidies are not enough for them to live in New York, so they're being shipped to more affordable communities, where they're virtually abandoned in substandard housing, according to the lawsuit.

While the program requires New York's Department of Homeless Services to conduct walk-throughs of apartments before placing people in them, the lawsuit contends that's rarely happened.
""Defendants have caused a public nuisance that has significantly harmed any considerable number of Newark's residents and the State of New Jersey residents,"" reads the lawsuit.

Newark leaders, who have outlawed SOTA in the city, claim 2,200 families have been placed in 62 New Jersey towns, including 1,198 in Newark.

""New York has continued to send people despite us having several discussions about our problems with their program,"" Newark's corporation counsel, Kenyatta Stewart, told the Newark Star-Ledger. ""We need to get a judge involved so they can stop shipping people to Newark.""
Elizabeth, New Jersey, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said in a statement Tuesday afternoon it was ""strongly considering going forward in joining Newark"" in a possible class-action lawsuit.

Avery Cohen, de Blasio's deputy press secretary, blasted the lawsuit in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday.

""In the face of a regional housing crisis, the City of Newark has inexplicably taken a page from the Trump playbook, building a wall to single out and prevent families from seeking housing where they want to live,"" Cohen's statement reads. ""This is wrong, hypocritical, and amounts to nothing short of income-based discrimination. We will continue to fight to ensure that families have the right to seek stable and safe housing.""
Sha-Kira Jones, one of several SOTA program participants named in the lawsuit, said she never wanted to live in New Jersey. She said she felt pressured to move there after living in a shelter for 10 months with her two young children while pregnant at the time, according to the lawsuit. They ended up in a Newark apartment, where the electricity stopped working and all the food in her refrigerator spoiled.

She claims complaints to her landlord were ignored, and New York City officials refused to intervene, according to the suit. She eventually learned she was living in an illegally converted apartment.
Another SOTA recipient -- whose name was not included in the lawsuit because the individual was ""fearful of future reprisal by the Defendants"" -- claimed in the lawsuit that her apartment was rodent- and roach-infested, the bathroom ceiling collapsed and that the heater never worked.

She said she was forced to leave the apartment when Newark city officials told her the building was being condemned.

Loreal Bell, another SOTA recipient, said she was moved into an apartment in Newark that was mice-infested, had faulty wiring and no heat, according to the suit. She claimed that when she complained to officials at the New York Department of Homeless Services, she was told to contact Newark officials.

""Ms. Bell,"" according to the lawsuit, ""feels like she was 'dumped here and is now a Newark problem.'"""
Video shows teen open mosque doors school stabbing,https://abcnews.go.com/US/video-shows-17-year-girl-hold-open-mosque/story?id=67504076,"
A 17-year-old girl is being praised for her ""remarkable"" actions after surveillance video showed her opening her mosque and ushering in students running from an alleged stabbing at their Wisconsin high school.

Duaa Ahmad, a senior at Oshkosh West High School, could be seen holding open the door to Oshkosh Ahmadiyya Muslims mosque and ushering in dozens before she herself went in.

""I just felt like I did what had to be done,"" Ahmad told ABC News in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Chaos ensued Tuesday morning after a 16-year-old student stabbed a school resource officer, who shot the student once at the high school, which was across from the mosque, according to Oshkosh Chief of Police Dean Smith.

Their injuries are expected to be non-life-threatening, authorities said.
While Ahmad said she felt ""a little fear,"" she was mainly focused on getting everyone inside.

She said that just minutes before, a teacher told students to run from the campus, but they didn't know why.

""It could have been anything. That fact that we didn't know caused even more anxiety,"" Ahmad said.
Yet, thankfully, she and other students exited through a door close to the mosque and everyone beelined toward it.

""I'm lucky that I was in that place when that situation ensued, and I'm just grateful that I was able to enter the code and let as many people in,"" Ahmad said.
While she didn't consider her actions heroic, her father and uncle were stunned when they saw the video.

""When I look at the video now, I feel pride,"" Saad Ahmad, her father, told ABC News.

""Her composure is remarkable in that situation,"" he said. ""I don't know how I would react in that situation.""

He added that while she looked calm, ""she was also scared.""
Duaa Ahmad's uncle, Khurram Ahmad, called it an ""uplifting"" moment in a terrifying situation.

""At first you see it, and you don't consider the subtlety in it that she remained outside,"" her uncle said. ""These are things that cannot be taught.""

He also serves as the public affairs secretary for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, to which the Oshkosh mosque belongs.
He said about 100 students from the school ran to the mosque and sought shelter there, thanks to his niece.

""At that moment, it was her alone. Her basic instinct kicked in,"" Khurram Ahmad said.

Duaa Ahmad is now focused on returning to school Friday and moving forward as a community, but she hopes that people will remember how terrifying these situations are.

""You never what that situation's gonna be like,"" she said, ""until you've actually experienced.""

Puppy with tail on his forehead gets adopted,https://abcnews.go.com/US/puppy-named-narwhal-tail-forehead-adopted-founder-missouri/story?id=67470618,"
A ""perfectly healthy"" rescue puppy with a surprising physical feature that makes him extra special has now been adopted by the founder of the organization who made him famous

Narwhal, the 10-week-old furball who has a small tail-like growth on his forehead, was adopted by Rochelle Steffen, the founder of Mac's Mission -- a nonprofit dog rescue that predominately helps pups with special needs
Steffen told ABC News last month that they found the adorable light brown dog, thought to be a dachshund and beagle mix, at a dump site in rural Jackson, Missouri, where she said ""hundreds"" [of dogs] have been dumped.

""He had x-rays and a vet visit ... and is a perfectly healthy puppy, with an extra tail on his face,"" Steffen said. ""There is no medical need to remove it currently and it is a third the size of his actual tail.""
""He is in no pain and plays for hours,"" she added.

A few weeks after the story went viral, Steffen has now decided to house the dog herself.

""I had no intention initially of keeping him,"" Steffen told the Southeast Missourian. ""It’s not just a decision from me. The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him.""
Steffen told the outlet that the rescue organization received hundreds of applications from people who wanted to rescue the dog, but decided that the dog is no longer for sale.

She also feared the dog might be exploited.

""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said, adding that she plans to train Narwhal as a therapy dog.
Mac's Mission focuses on helping dogs with deformity, clefts and trauma ""since those get euthanized far more than any others and there is a great need to give them a chance,"" Steffens told ABC News. ""We give them that chance.""
Because the nonprofit's life-saving efforts are strictly grassroots through social media, Steffens explained that Narwhal's story getting so much attention has been ""majorly epic for so many new folks to find out about our little awesome rescue.""

""We really love our little Narwhal and the others he is helping here with the attention!""

"Mom arrested for tying up son, setting home ablaze",https://abcnews.go.com/US/boy-rescued-house-fire-tied-plastic-bag-head/story?id=67459535,"
A California mother has been charged with felony child endangerment and arson after firefighters discovered her 3-year-old son trapped inside their burning home, which police say she set aflame.

Maricela Magana Ruiz, 47, allegedly left her son alone in a bedroom after putting a plastic bag over his head and tying his hands, according to a press release from the Santa Paula Police Department.

Firefighters discovered the little boy as they were trying to put out the fire on Sunday in the Santa Paula home, authorities said.
Ruiz was also found tied to a bed in the home, according to police.
Both were discovered after she called 911 to report the fire at 6:10 p.m. on Sunday. The little boy was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and has since been released to child protective services, authorities said.

Detective Allen Macias told ABC News on Tuesday that he did not know ""what was going through her mind at the time.""
He said that while a concrete motive hasn't been established, Ruiz was going through a ""pretty nasty custody battle"" with the boy's father.

It was not clear how long before she set the house aflame that she called 911, but when firefighters arrived ""all three stories [of the home] were filled with black smoke,"" Macias said.

Ruiz was initially charged with only felony child endangerment, but on Monday night investigators found evidence to charge her with arson as well.

She was booked into the Ventura County Jail. Her bail was initially set at $50,000 for felony child endangerment, but is now at $500,000.

Philip Glass' new piece will honor Peter Jennings,https://abcnews.go.com/US/philip-glass-write-orchestral-work-honor-news-anchor/story?id=67679791,"
Peter Jennings, the ABC News journalist whose voice was known to millions, will be honored by a new work from composer Philip Glass, whose music is known throughout the world.

Glass has been commissioned by Canada's National Arts Centre (NAC) to create a new orchestral piece in honor of the Canadian-born Jennings, who died of lung cancer in 2005 at the age of 67.
The new piece will be an ""ode to freedom of the press"" that is ""developed around the theme of truth in our times,"" according to NAC officials.

""Philip Glass ranks among the most influential composers of our time, and is a unique and bold artist who has long explored themes of truth, honesty and justice through his work,"" said NAC Music Director Alexander Shelley. ""It is a thrill and a privilege that he will be creating a new piece for Canada’s National Arts Centre Orchestra, honouring Peter Jennings’ legacy and scrutinizing a theme which has never seemed more important or relevant.""
Glass, whose music is known for its repetitive structure, has composed numerous scores for film and television, including a documentary hosted by Jennings years ago. His work was performed by the NAC Orchestra in 2016 after he received the Glenn Gould Prize for contributions to the arts.

""I was very impressed by the NAC Orchestra when receiving the Glenn Gould Prize, and was excited to receive this commission from them to honour the person, work and ethos of Peter Jennings, on a theme which is very close to my heart,"" Glass said.
Jennings began reporting for ABC News in 1964 and was named anchor and senior editor of ABC's ""World News Tonight"" in 1983.

Over his long career he won 16 Emmy Awards, two George Foster Peabody Awards, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and several Overseas Press Club Awards.

Prosecutor unexpectedly drops out of case involving murdered state senator,https://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutor-drops-case-involving-murdered-arkansas-state-sen/story?id=67533753,"
What was strange has gotten stranger in a high-profile murder case in northeastern Arkansas.

Without warning or explanation, the attorney prosecuting the death-penalty case of the woman accused of killing former state Sen. Linda Collins-Smith dropped out of the proceedings altogether this week.

The unexpected move comes a week after the judge in the case asked the state Supreme Court to replace him. Two weeks ago, the accused, Rebecca Lynn O’Donnell, was placed under strict jail segregation without legal justification.
And for months, the court has imposed a set of restrictions that have made it impossible for the public to understand what investigators have found and why O’Donnell was charged in the first place.

""Henry Boyce has moved to be relieved as Prosecuting Attorney,"" according to a three-sentence order signed Wednesday by the new judge, John Fogleman. ""The Motion for Withdrawal is hereby granted.""
Boyce’s assistant said the prosecutor had no comment. Court officials said Boyce’s request to the judge was verbal, so no written record is available.

Lee Short, an attorney for O’Donnell, told ABC News, ""The rules of professional conduct dictate when he must recuse. I trust that Mr. Boyce was following those guidelines when he made his decision. The change in prosecuting attorney is not going to alter the defense.""

Collins-Smith, 57, a well-to-do businesswoman, was found dead at her Pocahontas, Arkansas, home on June 4. O’Donnell, 49, was her friend and employee and is now charged with capital murder, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence.
Collins-Smith's son called police on the afternoon of June 4 to report that he and his grandfather were searching for his mother at her home because they hadn't heard from her. She was last seen alive on May 28. Smith told detectives he found a body wrapped in a blanket under a tarp in the driveway; it was later determined to be the former state senator.

O’Donnell has pleaded not guilty and her family has repeatedly protested that she would never kill Collins-Smith.
O’Donnell has been locked up in the Jackson County jail since she was arrested. Even though she has been a model prisoner, officials said, she was placed under the strictest detention protocols after the state police contacted the jailers.

A day after ABC News reported on the strange jailhouse restrictions, Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas said he lifted them.

O’Donnell’s fiancé, Tim Loggains, said, ""Becky is still being isolated and has no contact visitation with family. We, the family, still maintain Becky's innocence and cannot fathom the confusion and seeming incompetence in the handling of this case. Please pray for Becky.""

With all of the personnel changes, it is unclear how O’Donnell’s case will proceed. Prior to the moves of the last two weeks, O’Donnell’s next court appearance had been scheduled for Feb. 28, 2020, and the trial was tentatively set for next October.

Nazi salute photo leads to suspensions for corrections workers,https://abcnews.go.com/US/west-virginia-corrections-workers-suspended-disturbing-nazi-salute/story?id=67532626,"
A number of West Virginia corrections employees have been suspended in response to an image of them performing a Nazi salute.

The state's Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced the suspensions in a letter to employees on Wednesday, calling the image ""distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive and completely inappropriate.""
The controversial image, which was printed on state letterhead, showed about 30 trainees in uniform displaying the Nazi salute under a sign that read ""HAIL BYRD!"" The Basic Training Class No. 18 was conducted Oct. 21 through Nov. 27.

ABC News obtained a copy of the photo from the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety.
""I have seen the photo of Basic Training Class Number 18. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety Director Jeff Sandy wrote in the letter. ""It betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.""

Sandy did not say how many employees were suspended or explain how the photo came to light.
West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Commissioner Betsy Jividen has ordered that all copies of the image be destroyed, sent to her office or otherwise taken out of circulation ""to keep its harm from spreading,"" according to the letter.

""We have informed faith and community leaders of this incident,"" Sandy said. ""We have asked for their help to address it effectively, including with the recommended changes or additions to our training programs.""
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice also condemned the photo ""in the strongest possible terms"" and called for termination of the officers involved.

""I have directed Secretary Jeff Sandy of the Dept. of Military Affairs and Public Safety to continue actively investigating this incident and I have ordered the termination of all those that are found to be involved in this conduct,"" Justice said in a statement. ""This will not be tolerated on my watch -- within the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation -- or within any agency of state government.""

4 jail guards allegedly stood by as teen inmate attempted suicide,https://abcnews.go.com/US/guards-yorks-rikers-island-accused-watching-teen-inmate/story?id=67489717,"
Four correction officers, including a captain, at New York City's Rikers Island jail were suspended and accused of ""extremely troubling"" behavior after they allegedly stood by for seven minutes watching an 18-year-old inmate attempt to hang himself, authorities said.

The inmate tried to take his own life on Thanksgiving Day at the jail's George R. Vierno Center with a piece of clothing as the jailers looked on before intervening, officials said.

""The claims being made here are extremely troubling and we are taking them seriously,"" Cynthia Brann, commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction, said in a statement. ""The safety and well-being of those in our custody is our number one priority and an investigation into this incident is underway. Three officers and one captain have already been suspended and if the outcome of the investigation warrants we will take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination.""

The names of the suspended correction officers were not immediately released.
Brann said the incident, which occurred at about midnight Nov. 28, was referred to the city's Department of Investigation to conduct an independent inquiry.

The teenage inmate, identified by the city's Legal Aid Society as Nicholas Feliciano, was placed at Rikers Island on Nov. 18 after he was arrested on a parole violation.
The 18-year-old attempted suicide shortly after being removed from the general population after getting into a fight, officials said.

Feliciano was in a medically-induced coma Wednesday morning and remains under guard in the intensive care unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, according to the Legal Aid Society, which has assigned a defense attorney to represent him.
The Legal Aid Society said Feliciano has a history of mental health problems and suicide attempts.

""Nicholas’ tragedy illustrates the dangers and horrors of relying on our broken parole and correctional systems to address a mental health crisis,"" the Legal Aid Society said in a statement released on Wednesday. ""Despite his young age and known mental health history of past suicide attempts, Nicholas, who is 18 years old, was remanded to New York City jails – a system with a poor track record of managing suicide risks during incarceration – on allegations that have so far resulted in no criminal charges.""
Feliciano's doctors and the Legal Aid Society's Parole Revocation Defense Unit are calling on the state Department of Correction and Community Supervision to release him from custody due to his critical condition and immediately dismiss the parole violation.

""These constraints have already exacerbated his family’s grief and anxiety around this tragedy,"" the Legal Aid Society's statement reads.
""This outcome underscores the New York City Department of Correction's inability to safeguard the youngest people in its custody,"" the statement reads. ""It represents a colossal failure of supervision and leadership, one for which we demand answers before another New Yorker leaves the New York City jails in critical condition.”
The incident comes about two months after the New York City Council approved a plan to shut down Rikers Island, an 87-year-old, 400-acre lockup in New York City's East River. Rikers is the world's largest jail, housing roughly 7,000 inmates on any given day.

The jail is expected to be shuttered by 2026 and replaced with four smaller jails to be built an at estimated cost of $8 billion closer to the city's main courthouses in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens.

""Rikers Island is a symbol of brutality and inhumanity and it is time for us to once and for all close Rikers Island,"" New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, a Democrat, said after the council voted to close the jail. ""As a city we must do everything we can to move away from the failed policies of mass incarceration."""

More than 475,000 people are petitioning for criminal charges to be brought against two young men who were seen assaulting an injured deer.

The online petition, which, at the time this story was published, was just a few thousand signatures short of its 500,000 goal but was growing by the second, wrote that ""charges need to be filed with maximum sentencing.""

A video that circulated on the internet -- allegedly showing two people kicking the deer in its face, stepping on it and ripping its antlers out in Pennsylvania -- prompted the petition. The video has since been removed from Facebook but images appear to show the attack.
A spokesperson with the Pennsylvania Game Commission told ABC News on Wednesday authorities are expecting to announce charges soon, but no arrests have been made.
He said he could not release details about the attackers or the area in which the assault took place.

He also would not say exactly what was seen in the video, but the commission on Sunday called it ""reprehensible and potentially a violation of the law,"" according to a statement.

The attack comes about a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that make animal cruelty a federal felony.
The bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, criminalizes certain acts of animal cruelty.

Anyone with information regarding the deer incident is asked to contact the Operation Game Thief Hotline at 1-888–PGC-8001 or the Game Commission’s Northwest Region Dispatch Office at 814-432-3187.

1. Deadly shooting investigation

The FBI says it is working on the assumption that last week’s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola was an act of terror.

Three people were killed in the attack on Friday morning.

ABC News’ Josh Margolin tells “Start Here” that investigators are also probing a report that the alleged shooter, Saudi national Mohammed Ashamrani, watched mass-shooting vides in the days leading up to the attack.

2. Presentation day

The House Judiciary Committee will hear today from both Democratic and Republican attorneys, who will present evidence gathered in the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

ABC News’ Katherine Faulders tells the podcast that Democrats will likely split up the articles of impeachment into three separate “buckets:” “We're hearing abuse of power, obstruction and bribery.”
3. Investigating the investigators

The Department of Justice inspector general is set to release its findings today after investigating allegations of bias at origins of the Russia investigation.

ABC News Senior Investigative reporter Aaron Katersky explains that at issue for Republicans is the FISA warrant secured by the FBI to open surveillance against former Trump campaign staffer Carter Page: “Republicans have long argued that the application that the FBI used was flawed and tainted with political bias.”

A San Antonio man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and carving his name on her forehead with a knife.

Jackub Hildreth, 19, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after his girlfriend, 22-year-old Catalina Mireles, accused him of attacking her, according to police.

Mireles said the pair met on Facebook about four weeks ahead of the horrific attack, which left her with a broken jaw, a black eye and extreme swelling and bruising on her face.
She said the attack started on Thursday morning and lasted until the afternoon. The altercation started over an argument about their relationship.

Colton was killed on Thanksgiving in a hunting accident in Springfield, South Carolina, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Natural Resources told ABC News.

Details surrounding his death have not yet been released, but Furtick said the boy was out with his dad when the accident occurred.
Yet amid the tragedy, the family said the ""first positive"" has been the news that both of Colton's kidneys and his liver were donated to other families -- an effort that his mother, Caitlin, saw through.

""It just added some value to an otherwise senseless tragedy,"" Furtick said. ""It meant something to her that some part of him could carry on.""

He described Colton as a boy who was ""100% an outdoors-kind of guy."" He would always prefer a hunting rifle, fishing pole or basketball in his hands over a video game, according to Furtick.
He was also loved by the community. At Colton's funeral on Sunday, Furtick said he was stunned to see how many children came up to the family and said Colton was their best friend.

""A lot of them said that,"" his grandfather said. ""It's just heartbreaking to see him gone.""
While he said the family continues to grieve, the news of the organ donations has given them some solace. He hopes to meet those who now have Colton's organs soon and see, in person, how the boy's life has carried on.

""We're sitting here with our tears of grief while, at the same time, there are three families crying tears of joy,"" he said. ""We still got closure with our grandson and we still can help somebody else."""
Rain and snow moving from Midwest into the Northeast,https://abcnews.go.com/US/rain-snow-moving-midwest-northeast/story?id=67598206,"
Over the weekend a storm system that moved into the West Coast brought more than 5 inches of rain to northern California around the Bay area. This heavy rain flooded streets and even produced a few mudslides in the state.

In the mountains, heavy snow of 12 to 17 inches fell from California to Montana making driving extremely difficult on the roads.

Now this storm system is in the Midwest and the Great Lakes, bringing with it heavy snow from the Dakotas to Minnesota and into Michigan. A treacherous Monday morning commute is expected in the Twin Cities.

Numerous snow alerts have been issued this morning from the Upper Midwest and into the Great Lakes.

Further south, heavy rain is moving through Indianapolis and Detroit.

Some of the heavy rain will move into the Northeast later this afternoon into the evening hours, just in time for evening rush hour. Snow will be ending in the Midwest by this afternoon.
By Tuesday, the cold front will move through the Midwest and the Northeast and, behind it, colder air will mix with precipitation changing it to snow from the Mid-South all the way into the Northeast.

By Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, the rain will change to snow for most major cities along I-95 and there could be several inches of accumulation.

The Wednesday morning rush could be messy from Washington, D.C. to New York City and Boston.
Snow could even fall Tuesday evening in the South from northern Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee and into West Virginia.

At the moment, it looks like the heaviest snow Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning will be from the southern Appalachians and into southeast New England where 3 to 6 inches of snow could fall in Boston.

Supreme Court rejects Trump administration's plan to resume federal executions,https://abcnews.go.com/US/supreme-court-rejects-trump-administrations-plan-resume-federal/story?id=67526443,"
The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request from the Trump administration to lift an injunction on federal executions, blocking the government's plan for five convicted murderers to be put to death by mid-January.

Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh issued a statement concurring with the decision, saying ""in light of what is at stake, it would be preferable for the District Court’s decision to be reviewed on the merits by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit before the executions are carried out.""

Daniel Lewis Lee, 46, a white supremacist convicted in 1999 along with co-defendant Chevie O'Brien Kehoe in the killings of three members of an Arkansas family, including an 8-year-old girl, had been scheduled to be the first prisoner in 16 years to be executed by the federal government.

Lee's execution, originally scheduled for Monday at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, has now been put on hold indefinitely. He remains housed on federal death row at the prison along with 61 other condemned inmates.
The decision by the Supreme Court came just days after U.S. Attorney General William Barr asked the justices to set aside a district court's injunction preventing it from carrying out lethal injections as planned.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington temporarily halted the executions after four of the five prisoners the government had scheduled for executions filed a lawsuit challenging a new lethal injection protocol.

""The Justice Department upholds the rule of law -- and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,"" Barr said in July when he announced the government was set to resume executions.

The death row inmates slated for execution sued, arguing the government's new drug protocol to be used in lethal injections violates the 1994 Federal Death Penalty Act, a law that leaves it up to the state where a capital crime was committed to prescribe the method of execution.

Chutkan sided with the inmates' argument that the federal government was attempting to circumvent proper methods for execution in a rush to carry them out.

The judge, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, ruled that the federal government likely exceeded its authority by implementing a single uniform method of execution, rather than adhering to the state-by-state approach under the FDPA.

""There is no statute that gives the (federal government) the authority to establish a single implementation procedure for all federal executions,"" Chutkan wrote in her ruling. ""To the contrary, Congress, through the FDPA, expressly reserved those decisions for the states of conviction.""
On Tuesday, a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia denied the Trump administration's plea to put Chutkan's ruling on hold and allow the executions to be carried out. Just hours after the appeals court upheld Chutkan's ruling, the Department of Justice asked the nation's highest court to lift the stay.
In July, Barr announced that federal executions would resume under a new lethal injection protocol in which a single drug, pentobarbital sodium, would be used.

The last prisoner to face federal execution was Louis Jones Jr., 53, a Gulf War veteran convicted in federal court of kidnapping Air Force  Pvt. Tracie Joy McBride, 19, in 1995 from the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, raping her and then beating her to death with a tire iron.
Jones was executed on March 18, 2003, at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, where the only federal death chamber is located.

Following Jones's death, federal executions went dormant due to controversy over the humanness of using the old three-drug cocktail for lethal injection and a shortage on one of the drugs, sodium thiopental.
On Wednesday, 14 states which use the single-drug protocol in lethal injections, filed a joint brief supporting the Trump administration's failed request to carry out the death sentences. The states include Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, South Dakota, and Texas.

Lee's execution was opposed by loved ones of his victims -- Nancy Mueller, her husband William Mueller, and her 8-year-old daughter Sarah Powell.

Amnesty International, which calls the death penalty ""the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment,"" released a statement in July decrying the move by the Trump administration to resume federal executions.

According to the Department of Justice, other inmates that were scheduled to be executed prior to getting the reprieve from the Supreme Court included Lezmond Mitchell, who fatally stabbed a 63-year-old Arizona woman and her 9-year-old granddaughter; Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped, murdered and dismembered a 16-year-old Kansas City, Missouri, girl and bludgeoned to death a 80-year-old Missouri woman; and Alfred Bourgeois who tortured, sexual molested and murdered his toddler daughter.

Mitchel, Purkey and Bourgeois had all been scheduled to be executed in December.

Dustin Lee Honken, who shot and killed five people in Iowa in 1993, including a single mother and her 10- and 6-year-old daughters, was slated to be executed on Jan. 15.

While federal executions have been frozen for 16 years, the death penalty has been carried out in several states during that time, including more than 100 in Texas and Missouri since 2012.

On Thursday, Tennessee executed 53-year-old Lee Hall in the electric chair. Hall, who went blind in prison, killed his estranged girlfriend, Traci Crozier, 22, 1991 when he set her car on fire with her inside. He was the second blind prisoner to be executed in the United States since the nation reinstated the death penalty in 1976."
Chicago's top cop responds to his firing after he's found asleep in squad car,https://abcnews.go.com/US/ousted-chicago-police-superintendent-responds-mayors-decision-fire/story?id=67467918,"
Chicago's ousted police chief broke his silence on Tuesday, a day after the city's mayor revealed that he'd been fired over ""ethical lapses.""

Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Monday, less than a month before he was scheduled to retire, accusing the top cop of misleading city officials and the public after officers found him asleep in his vehicle in October.
Johnson acknowledged on Tuesday that he made a ""poor decision and had a lapse of judgment"" on that October night, an incident he previously blamed on a problem with his medication. Johnson said he had pulled over because he was feeling light-headed, later falling asleep.
He called it ""a mistake,"" but maintained that he did not ""intentionally mislead or deceive the mayor or the people of Chicago.""
""I know in my heart that I have always tried to act in a way that is in the best interests of the great city,"" Johnson said in a statement, noting that he had no interest in fighting for his reputation. ""Reputations are not built in a day and not damaged in a day either.""

""I will simply rely on the reputation for integrity that I think I have earned during my long career, with the faith that we should all be judged by the entirety of our lives and not on what happened on our worst days,"" he added.
An official briefed on the probe into Johnson's conduct told ABC News that during the traffic stop in question, the superintendent showed his police ID when asked to present identification. The officers apparently didn't recognize Johnson immediately. Once the superintendent showed ID, he and the officers exchanged some words, and Johnson said he was OK to drive away. The cops let him, raising questions about why Johnson wasn't given a field sobriety test.

Lightfoot said an inspector general's report, which hasn't been released publicly, showed Johnson exhibited ""flawed decision-making.""

""It has become clear that Mr. Johnson engaged in a series of ethical lapses that are intolerable,"" Lightfoot said in statement Monday. ""Mr. Johnson was intentionally dishonest with me and communicated a narrative replete with false statements regarding material aspects of the incident that happened in the early morning hours of October 17.""

""Had I known all the facts at the time,"" she added, ""I would have relieved him of his duties as superintendent then and there.""

Pre-made sushi and spring rolls makes for a great work day lunch, but after a new recall it may be time to toss the hand roll.

Fuji Food Products, Inc. (Fuji) announced a voluntary recall of ready-to-eat sushi, salads and spring rolls that were sold at retailers in 31 states including Trader Joe's, along the East Coast and Midwest.

The products were also sold at 7 Eleven, Walgreens, Food Lion, Hannaford, Giant Eagle Supermarkets, Porkys, Bozzutos, Supreme Lobster and Superior Foods.

Fuji voluntarily issued a recall after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the company of potential product contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, according to a press release. Public health officials have not yet reported any illness associated with the recalled products.
""As responsible processors of safe, fresh food for nearly 30 years, we are addressing this problem vigorously and we apologize to those who are affected by it,"" Fuji Food Products CEO Farrell Hirsch said in a statement. ""We will restart operation only after we have eliminated the cause and the FDA certifies that our facility is once again free of possible contamination.""
The small plastic trays have a clear lid with a sell-by date clearly marked on the label, where consumers can check to see if their products were affected.

Recalled items included poke bowls, bahn mi style salad, spring rolls, California rolls, smoked salmon Philly roll and tempura shrimp rolls and more.

A majority of the affected products were marked with sell-by dates between Nov. 19 and Dec. 6.

""Dispose of the product in an appropriate waste container,"" the FDA urged.

"Police arrest 2 of 4 teens, 1 accused of murder, who escaped from jail",https://abcnews.go.com/US/manhunt-underway-teens-including-accused-murder-escaped-nashville/story?id=67421283,"
Police have caught two of the four teenagers who escaped from a juvenile detention center in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, over the weekend. Two of those who escaped were charged with murder, with one of them being caught Tuesday evening.

Murder suspect Morris Marsh, 17, remains free after he and three others allegedly ran out of the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center at around 10 p.m. Saturday night. Brandon Caruthers, 17, also remains free, according to authorities.

The Metro Nashville Police Department shared photos of the two other suspects after they were rearrested on Tuesday night in Madison, a suburb of Nashville.
The teens were on a work detail when their staff supervisor left them to address a fight at another location inside the facility, according to police. They managed to get onto an elevator and used staff protocols to ride to the ground floor where they went through a series of doors and exited to the outside.

Authorities said they are considered dangerous and are asking for the public's help in locating them. Authorities said at least 35 minutes elapsed before the Metro Nashville Police Department was notified of the escape.
Marsh is suspected of killing 19-year-old Charles Easley in April, according to police.

Caruthers had been transferred to adult court on an August 2018 armed robbery case in south Nashville, according to police.

The department had said it reviewed surveillance footage from a store in Clarksville, Tennessee, located about 50 miles northwest of Nashville, in connection to a possible sighting, but investigators later determined that it was unrelated.
""After further review of the Clarksville market video from multiple angles by an MNPD Juv Crime Task Force officer in Clarksville it has just been determined that the persons in the video are not the escaped teens,"" the department said in a tweet Sunday. ""The investigation is continuing in Davidson County.""

ABC News does not normally name juveniles, but are doing so because police said they are dangerous individuals and have released their names and photos. Anyone with information about the remaining two escapees are asked to call Nashville's Emergency Communications Center at 615-862-8600 immediately.

"Girl, 12, posted kill list of students: Police",https://abcnews.go.com/US/12-year-girl-arrested-posting-death-list-snapchat/story?id=67604173,"
A 12-year-old Florida girl was arrested for posting a ""death list"" on social media and threatening to attack students at her middle school, police said.

A student and her parent at Falcon Cove Middle School in Weston contacted the Broward County Sheriff's Office on Dec. 6 around 7 p.m. to report a threat posted on Snapchat, the sheriff's office said in a press release.

The threat ""included a death list with student names"" from the school, police said.
A second threat was also posted to Snapchat the same afternoon that allegedly said the ""students were not safe and that they would be killed on Monday, Dec. 9,"" according to police.

Detectives with the Threat Management Unit and Real Time Crime Center were able to identify that the source of the threats belonged to a 12-year-old girl from Weston, who is also a student at the same middle school.
The girl allegedly confirmed she made the threats, which were determined to be false, police said. She was arrested on Saturday evening and taken to the Juvenile Assessment Center.
The 12-year-old suspect currently faces two counts of a written threat to kill and false reporting concerning a firearm.

Police have not said why she made the threats."
Officer 'ambushed and executed' outside police station,https://abcnews.go.com/US/arkansas-police-officer-shot-killed-precinct/story?id=67576439,"
An Arkansas police officer has been shot and killed outside their police precinct.

Officers with the Fayetteville Police Department were inside the building when they heard gunshots outside at approximately 9:42 p.m. on Saturday, according to a statement from the Fayetteville Police Department.

When two responding officers went outside they located an armed suspect, later identified as London T. Phillips, directly behind the police department.

Phillips exchanged gunfire with officers and was shot during the encounter, police said.
The victim, Officer Stephen Carr, was later found shot inside his patrol vehicle that was parked in the police department parking lot, authorities said.
Emergency medical personnel responded to the scene and treated the officer and the suspect but both of them succumbed to their injuries. and were pronounced dead on scene.

An investigation showed Carr was ""ambushed and executed"" while sitting in his patrol vehicle, police said.

In a brief press conference Fayetteville Police Chief Mike Reynolds said there seems to have been no motive at all and it ""appears the suspect came into the back parking lot and just executed my officer.""
Carr was assigned as a patrol officer and had been with the department since April 2017.

""He served our community with dedication and professionalism for the past 2 ½ years, he is a HERO,"" police said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Officer Carr’s family during this tragic time.""

California power utility PG&E reaches $13.5B settlement for 2017-2018 wildfires,https://abcnews.go.com/US/california-power-utility-pge-reaches-135b-settlement-2017/story?id=67561176,"
PG&E, the California power utility, has reached a $13.5 billion settlement with victims of the catastrophic Northern California wildfires of 2017 and 2018.

The agreement settles the last major lawsuit to arise from the 2017-2018 fires, following a $1 settlement with affected cities and counties, and an $11 billion settlement with the insurance companies handling claims.
Officials with PG&E, which last year filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in anticipation of its legal challenges, said Friday's settlement will put the utility on a path to emerge from Chapter 11 by the state-imposed June 30, 2020 deadline.
“From the beginning of the Chapter 11 process, getting wildfire victims fairly compensated, especially the individuals, has been our primary goal,"" PG&E CEO and President Bill Johnson said in a statement. ""We want to help our customers, our neighbors and our friends in those impacted areas recover and rebuild after these tragic wildfires.""

In addition to covering the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, the agreement settles claims related to the 2017 Tubbs fire and the 2016 Ghost Ship warehouse fire, although PG&E did not admit fault in the latter two fires.
The Camp Fire, the most devastating in the state's history, was responsible for at least 80 deaths. More than 18,600 structures were destroyed in the blaze, which scorched upwards of 150,000 acres in Northern California's Butte County.

Improperly maintained PG&E power lines were found to be responsible for sparking the blaze.

Friday's settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

Brother of victim in wrong-apartment shooting receives police group's 'courage award',https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-group-courage-award-brother-man-killed-amber/story?id=67463376,"
A national law enforcement group has bestowed an award on the brother of a man who was killed in a 2018 wrong-apartment shooting by former Dallas police Officer Amber Guyger, whom he hugged and forgave in an extraordinary act of mercy before she was sent to prison for murder.

The Institute of Law Enforcement Administration gave 18-year-old Brandt Jean, the brother of Botham Jean, its 2019 Ethical Courage Award during a ceremony Tuesday morning at the organization's offices in Plano, Texas.

Jean and his family, who hail from the eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia, were on hand to accept the award from one of the country's leading learning centers for law enforcement executives, managers and supervisors.
""Despite an unimaginable loss, he saw the humanity in the person responsible for his brother's death,"" Gregory Smith, director of the Institute of Law Enforcement Administration, said in a statement. ""He saw her pain and regret, and had the ability to show empathy, caring and forgiveness.""

Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this year after a jury found her guilty in the Sept. 6, 2018, fatal shooting of the 26-year-old Jean, a church-going accountant. Guyger is appealing the case.

During her trial, Guyger, 31, testified that she mistook Botham Jean's apartment for her own and shot him when she entered the unlatched front door, saying she thought he was an intruder who planned on killing her.
At Guyger's Oct. 2, sentencing hearing, Brandt Jean took the witness stand and spoke directly to Guyger, saying that he forgave her and that ""I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.""

""I love you just like anyone else and I'm not going to hope you rot and die,"" Brandt Jean told Guyger. ""I personally want the best for you. I wasn't going to say this in front of my family, I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you because I know that's exactly what Botham would want for you. Give your life to Christ. I think giving your life to Christ is the best thing Botham would want for you.""
He then asked Judge Tammy Kemp, who presided over Guyger's trial, if he could hug Guyger, a request the judge granted.

Brandt Jean stepped off the witness stand and met Guyger in front of the judge's bench and embraced her as Guyger broke into tears.

In a subsequent interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Brandt Jean spoke out for the first time about the moment that shocked the nation and spurred a national conversation on forgiveness.
""This is what you have to do to set yourself free. I didn't really plan on living the rest of my life hating this woman,"" he said. ""I know that there's something called peace of mind and that's the type of stuff you need to do to have peace of mind. That is why I wake up happy in the morning. That is why I want to live happy later on in my life."""
Scandal-plagued Buffalo Bishop resigns following Vatican review of his diocese,https://abcnews.go.com/US/buffalo-bishop-resigns-vatican-review-diocese/story?id=67489074,"
Bishop Richard Malone, the scandal-plagued spiritual leader of the Diocese of Buffalo, has resigned in the wake of widespread criticism of his handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by local clergy members.

His departure, announced via press release by the Vatican on Wednesday morning, follows a report on the troubled diocese authorized by the Holy See and submitted to the Vatican’s Congregation for Bishops in November.

""The Holy Father accepted the renunciation of the pastoral government of the diocese of Buffalo (U.S.A.), presented by S.E. Mons. Richard J. Malone,” reads the announcement when translated from from Italian, “and appointed Apostolic Administrator vacant seat of the same diocese S.E. Mons. Edward B. Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany.”

Malone is the first bishop in the 172-year history of the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to resign from office. In a statement released after the Vatican’s announcement, Malone acknowledged that his position had become untenable but continued to defend his legacy.

“Despite the measurable progress we have achieved together, I have concluded after much prayer and discernment that the spiritual welfare of the people of the Diocese of Buffalo will be better served by a new bishop who perhaps is better able to bring about the reconciliation, healing and renewal that is so needed,” Malone said in the statement. “As such, I requested of His Holiness Pope Francis that he permit me to retire early, and he agreed to do so. … It is my honest assessment that I have accomplished as much as I am able to, and that there remain divisions and wounds that I am unable to bind and heal.”

He insisted that while he “was made aware of the general conclusions of the report” to the Vatican, “my decision to retire early was made freely and voluntarily.”
Scharfenberger will take over the diocese immediately as a temporary administrator while the Vatican searches for a permanent replacement.

The Diocese of Buffalo has been in a state of crisis since last year, when Siobhan O'Connor, Malone's former personal secretary, leaked internal church documents to investigative reporter Charlie Specht from ABC's local station WKBW, sparking months of reporting about whether there had been efforts to conceal the extent of the problem from the public.

In an interview with ABC News that aired as a special edition of Nightline in July, Malone defended his leadership, including his decision to allow Fr. Dennis Riter, a local pastor who has faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, to return to ministry after a lawyer hired by the church to investigate the matter concluded the allegations had “no merit.” Riter has denied the accusations and continues to serve as pastor of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in the Buffalo suburb of Dunkirk.

“I feel that in the almost 20 years I have been a bishop, I’ve tried hard to be a good shepherd,” Malone told ABC News, arguing that he had “inherited a decades old horrific problem of abuse.”
But the crisis only deepened in September with the emergence of secret audio recordings, made by Malone’s then-secretary and diocesan vice chancellor Fr. Ryszard Biernat and obtained by both WKBW and ABC News.

The recordings suggest Malone sought to conceal allegations that an active priest had sexually harassed a then-seminarian, even though Malone can be heard on the tapes describing the accused priest as ""a sick puppy"" and calling his alleged penchant for manipulation and retaliation ""dangerous.""

Despite the ensuing public outrage and growing calls for his ouster from both religious and civic leaders, Malone initially appeared steadfast in his refusal to resign, suggesting the absence of action from the Vatican constituted an implicit endorsement of his leadership.

“They say the pope frequently picks up the phone and calls people around the world, but I have not been the recipient of one of these calls,” Malone said during an emergency briefing with a hand-picked group of reporters following the publication of the recordings. “I’ve had no communications from the pope at all.”

“I know for sure they're not unaware of all the news around here,” he continued. “But so far apparently I like to think they are trusting in my goodwill and my intention and my capacity working with other people to lead us further.”

That changed in October, when the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C., the Vatican's U.S. representative, announced that its office had authorized Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of the Diocese of Brooklyn to conduct an ""Apostolic Visitation,"" described as ""a fact-finding mission which reports directly to the Holy See … to evaluate situations in dioceses.”
Following the announcement of Malone’s resignation on Wednesday, DiMarzio released a statement on his review, saying that his team spoke with “more than 80 people over a period of several weeks” but giving no indication of whether or when its conclusions might be made public.

“What I found are many deeply devoted Catholics who love their Church,” DiMarzio said in a statement. “I pray this moment of suffering and pain will lead to a birth of new faith. With the appointment of the Most Reverend Edward Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany, to oversee the Buffalo Diocese, I am confident that Buffalo Catholics are in good hands. I hope that now Catholics in Buffalo can begin the process of moving forward, healing, and helping the diocese in all of its ministries.”

Malone’s critics largely viewed the news as a step in the right direction.

Matthew Golden, who has accused Malone of allowing Fr. Riter, his alleged abuser, to escape consequences, hailed the announcement as a “huge victory” for survivors of clergy abuse and their advocates.

“With the persistence and determination of a few individuals,” he told ABC News, “this glorious day in Buffalo has finally arrived. One done, Riter to go.”

Mitchell Garabedian, the famed Boston-based clergy abuse attorney who represents 38 alleged victims in Buffalo, including one of Fr. Riter’s other accusers, said Malone’s resignation sends a “loud message.”

“The resignation of Bishop Malone provides hope to clergy sexual abuse victims that morality will prevail, justice will be served and that their voices can and will create positive change,” Garabedian said in a statement. “The resignation sends a loud message to clergy sexual abuse victims to stand tall and be proud.”

And Siobhan O’Connor, the whistleblower who sparked the initial scandal, said she is relieved after what she described as a long struggle for survivors and the diocese.

""For me, this is a time not for rejoicing, but for relief,” O’Connor said, “The resignation of [Malone] is long overdue.”
But the future for Buffalo’s Catholic community remains unclear. Both the FBI and the New York Attorney General are currently investigating the diocese, and Malone’s successor could inherit a crisis, albeit more of a financial one, of his own.

According to The Buffalo News, the diocese was considering filing for bankruptcy as it faces dozens of new lawsuits brought against the diocese following New York’s opening of a one-year window outside the statute of limitations for new civil litigation from alleged victims of childhood sexual abuse.

In his introductory remarks to the media on Wednesday, Bishop Scharfenberger, the temporary administrator, stressed the need for a more “open and honest” approach.

“We can’t be afraid of reality,” Scharfenberger said. “We have to look at things with sober eyes and look at the damage that was done.”"

As President Donald Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in Washington, D.C., Rudy Giuliani is in Europe meeting with current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary series.

The president's personal attorney is working with One America News Network (OAN) to discredit what the far-right network calls ""the impeachment hoax"" and offer proof of Ukrainian corruption and 2016 election meddling, according to an OAN spokesperson.

Despite heightened scrutiny in the impeachment inquiry and a campaign finance case involving two of his associates in the Southern District of New York, Giuliani is ""not letting up on his investigation,"" ABC News Senior Editorial Producer John Santucci tells ""Start Here.""

""We know that from hearings over the last couple days that his associates have information that they believe is important to the impeachment inquiry,"" he says.

Uber noted that ""riders account for nearly half (45%) of the accused parties across the 5 most serious sexual assault categories"" in the study, but added that ""any safety issue is exceptionally rare"" and ""by bringing hard data to bear, we can make every trip safer for drivers and riders alike.""
3. Border custody death

There's growing backlash over the death of Carlos Vasquez, a 16-year-old migrant, in a Border Patrol cell after video surfaced showing his final hours in May as he suffered from the flu.

Current and former Border Patrol officials told ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman that the agency was overwhelmed with migrants at the time and they conducted welfare checks, but the video obtained by ProPublica appears to indicate otherwise.

""Had he been taken to the hospital, he would have survived,"" Gutman says. ""Instead, he was taken to this cell. It is basically like a drunk tank, for all intents and purposes, with a concrete bed, and that's where he spent his final minutes.""When 16-year-old Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez died in a Border Patrol cell last May, the agency released a statement.We obtained video footage that does not match the Border Patrol’s account of his death. pic.twitter.com/MpIGS5B6Cg— ProPublica (@propublica) December 6, 2019 When 16-year-old Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez died in a Border Patrol cell last May, the agency released a statement.We obtained video footage that does not match the Border Patrol’s account of his death. pic.twitter.com/MpIGS5B6Cg

The Institute of Law Enforcement Administration gave 18-year-old Brandt Jean, the brother of Botham Jean, its 2019 Ethical Courage Award during a ceremony Tuesday morning at the organization's offices in Plano, Texas.

Jean and his family, who hail from the eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia, were on hand to accept the award from one of the country's leading learning centers for law enforcement executives, managers and supervisors.
""Despite an unimaginable loss, he saw the humanity in the person responsible for his brother's death,"" Gregory Smith, director of the Institute of Law Enforcement Administration, said in a statement. ""He saw her pain and regret, and had the ability to show empathy, caring and forgiveness.""

Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this year after a jury found her guilty in the Sept. 6, 2018, fatal shooting of the 26-year-old Jean, a church-going accountant. Guyger is appealing the case.

During her trial, Guyger, 31, testified that she mistook Botham Jean's apartment for her own and shot him when she entered the unlatched front door, saying she thought he was an intruder who planned on killing her.
At Guyger's Oct. 2, sentencing hearing, Brandt Jean took the witness stand and spoke directly to Guyger, saying that he forgave her and that ""I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.""

""I love you just like anyone else and I'm not going to hope you rot and die,"" Brandt Jean told Guyger. ""I personally want the best for you. I wasn't going to say this in front of my family, I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you because I know that's exactly what Botham would want for you. Give your life to Christ. I think giving your life to Christ is the best thing Botham would want for you.""
He then asked Judge Tammy Kemp, who presided over Guyger's trial, if he could hug Guyger, a request the judge granted.

Brandt Jean stepped off the witness stand and met Guyger in front of the judge's bench and embraced her as Guyger broke into tears.

In a subsequent interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Brandt Jean spoke out for the first time about the moment that shocked the nation and spurred a national conversation on forgiveness.
""This is what you have to do to set yourself free. I didn't really plan on living the rest of my life hating this woman,"" he said. ""I know that there's something called peace of mind and that's the type of stuff you need to do to have peace of mind. That is why I wake up happy in the morning. That is why I want to live happy later on in my life."""
"'Start Here': 'Targeted attack' in Jersey City, UK election, and Harvey Weinstein",https://abcnews.go.com/US/start-here-targeted-attack-jersey-city-uk-election-harvey/story?id=67662315,"
It's Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019. Let's start here.

1. 'Targeted attack'

Authorities in New Jersey are now calling Tuesday's shooting rampage inside a Jersey City kosher supermarket a ""targeted attack.""

""We haven't heard from law enforcement definitively one way or the other whether these suspects were out targeting Jews generally,"" ABC News Senior Investigative Reporter Aaron Katersky tells ""Start Here"" today. ""We do know that law enforcement believes they are members of the Black Israelites, which the FBI believes to be a domestic terror group ... and that may be driving this toward a case of domestic terrorism.""

Three civilians and Jersey City detective Joseph Seals were killed in the attack. The suspects, identified as 50-year-old Francine Graham and 47-year-old David Anderson, also died in the gun battle and sources told ABC News that Anderson recently made anti-Semitic posts online.

2. UK election

Voters in the U.K. head to the polls today for an election that could have major implications for Brexit.

ABC News' Marcus Wilford, who runs the London bureau, breaks down the stakes on the podcast: ""It decides the future of Boris Johnson. If he gets elected prime minister, he brings through Brexit relatively quickly, but if he doesn't -- Boris is cast into the political wilderness and either way, the country and its future change course.""
3. Weinstein settlement

Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has reached a settlement with dozens of his accusers worth $47 million in total.

Under the terms of the deal, insurers of the bankrupt Weinstein Company would fund the payout, according to ABC News' Eva Pilgrim: ""[Weinstein] doesn't have to admit to any wrongdoing in this civil settlement and he's actually not even paying out of his own pocket this money.""

The settlement is separate from his criminal case, which will go to trial in January. The two women who are the alleged victims in the criminal case are not parties to the settlement.

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty in his criminal case and has consistently denied ""any allegations of non-consensual sex"" with anyone.

Johnny Gondesen, 83, of Cypress, Texas, wrote and recorded a Christmas song in 1965 with his band. The song, called ""Christmas Is Here,"" never got any radio play -- so all Gondesen wanted was to hear it on the radio.
With the help of his family, his recording reached 104.1 KRBE in Houston, which, 54 years after the song was written, invited Gondesen, now a great-grandfather, to hear his song played live on the station this month.

Actor Ron Leibman dead at 82,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/actor-ron-leibman-dead-82-67558718,"
Actor Ron Leibman, who appeared in movies, theater and television in a career that spanned six decades and won a Tony award for Tony Kushner's iconic play ”Ängels in America,"" has died after an illness. He was 82.
Leibman's agent, Robert Attermann, said the actor died Friday. He gave no further details, but a person who knew the actor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the cause was pneumonia. Leibman is survived by his wife, the actress Jessica Walter.
In his lengthy career, Leibman played a huge variety of roles both dramatic and comic. He appeared in numerous films including “Norma Rae,"" opposite Sally Field, and “Slaughterhouse-Five.” He won an Emmy award in 1979 for the short-lived CBS series “Kaz,” which he also created. He was perhaps best known on television for his role on “Friends,” though, in which he played Dr. Leonard Green, the father of Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston. 
A crowning moment of Leibman's career was his leading-actor Tony in 1993 for playing the fearsome role of Roy Cohn, the conservative lawyer and chief counsel to Sen. Joseph McCarthy who died of AIDS in 1986. Leibman's performance was called ”blood-churning"" by New York Times critic Frank Rich, and “frenzied” by Associated Press critic Michael Kuchwara.
Accepting his Tony, Leibman told the audience that he'd seen his first Broadway play at 3 years old. 
“I've been a professional actor for 35 years,"" he said. ““Angels in America'' is my tenth Broadway play, and this is my first Tony nomination. I hope you know in your hearts how deeply grateful I am to be here tonight."" Thanking his wife, Jessica, he quipped: ""Maybe we can get an apartment with a washer-dryer now."" 
Sally Field, who won an Oscar for ""Norma Rae,"" playing a textile worker to Leibman's labor organizer, paid tribute to the actor         on Twitter.      
”So many of the best memories of my career have Ron Leibman in them,"" Field wrote. She thanked him “for being my champion.”
Leibman was born Oct. 11, 1937 in New York, and attended Ohio Wesleyan University. An earlier marriage to actress Linda Lavin ended in divorce. 
“Ron was an incredibly talented actor with a distinguished career in film, TV and theater,"" said Attermann, his agent. “Our thoughts go out to his wife, Jessica, and his family.”"
Student stabs resource officer at high school,https://abcnews.go.com/US/armed-student-confronts-resource-officer-wisconsin-high-school/story?id=67463315,"
A 16-year-old student allegedly stabbed a school resource officer at a Wisconsin high school Tuesday morning and the officer shot the student in response, according to local police.

Both the student and officer were hospitalized after the incident at Oshkosh West High School, the Oshkosh Police Department said.

Their injuries are believed to be non-life threatening, Oshkosh Chief of Police Dean Smith said at a news conference.
No other students were injured at the school in Oshkosh, about 90 miles north of Milwaukee, said police.

The stabbing and subsequent shooting stemmed from an ""altercation"" between the officer and 16-year-old at the school resource officer's office, Smith said.

The student used an ""edged"" weapon in the stabbing, Smith said, but the chief declined to call the weapon a knife.
The officer shot the student once. The officer called for help at 9:12 a.m. and first responders arrived at the school two minutes later, said Smith.

The high school, which has over 1,600 students, was evacuated and has been deemed safe, said police.
But the Oshkosh police said its officers are investigating ""a comment that was made on social media implying a possible threat"" toward another school in the area -- Oshkosh North High School, the department said in a statement.

""A comment was written on the Oshkosh Police Department’s Facebook page under the post about the officer involved shooting that occurred at Oshkosh West [High School],"" the police department said.

Police said they do not believe students are in further danger and ""that this comment was not meant to be a threat against Oshkosh North High school.""

In the wake of the officer-involved shooting, classes were canceled for Wednesday throughout the Oshkosh Area School District, said Superintendent Vicki Cartright.
On Monday, about 80 miles away from Oshkosh, a student brought two pellet guns to Waukesha South High School in Waukesha, Wisconsin, according to police.

The 17-year-old boy ignored police commands and pointed a gun at an officer, who then shot the teen three times, twice in the arm and once in the leg, said Waukesha police.

The student was hospitalized in stable condition, police said."
Conservationist attacked by her own tigers at animal sanctuary,https://abcnews.go.com/US/conservationist-attacked-tigers-animal-sanctuary/story?id=67575571,"
A wildlife conservationist was attacked and injured by several of her own tigers during an event at a wildlife sanctuary in southern California.

Patty Perry, founder of Wildlife Environmental Conservation (WEC) in Moorpark, California, suffered puncture wounds and several cuts after at least two of the tigers attacked her during a special event for donors.

""They began to play with her and the Bengal took both paws and wrapped them around her legs. She fell on the ground and another tiger jumped on her and began to pull on her before they got her out and she got some lacerations,” said friend and WEC attorney Michael Bradbury to ABC News’ Los Angeles station KABC.

Witnesses, including several members of the fire department, rushed to Perry’s aid during the attack.
""A lot of people I'm sure that saw it were horrified thinking the worst. She said it was obvious they were playing with her because they do love her. She raised them from babies,"" said Bradbury.

Perry has 50 animals at the facility including zebras, birds, and leopards.

“We use live animal ambassadors for our outreach programs. The impact our information delivers to the public is second only to the impact created by the wildlife,” says the sanctuary’s website. “The animals are the real teachers.”
Bradbury told KABC that animal control is aware of the incident but does not expect anything to happen.

""It’s never happened before. She’s ... been with those tigers, you know, on hundreds and hundreds of occasions and gone through the same kind of routine virtually daily,” Bradbury said.

Bradbury says that Perry knows the animals didn’t mean to harm her and that she is absolutely heartbroken over what happened and, as soon as she is released from the hospital and the investigation concludes, she will be right back doing her normal routine with the animals again.

Judge concedes his advice that men are 'in control' was 'undeniably misguided',https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-judge-regrets-advice-domestic-violence-suspect-men/story?id=67458180,"
A New Jersey judge under fire for advising a domestic violence suspect of alternative ways besides using his fists to let women know men are ""in control"" now says his comments in court were ""undeniably misguided.""

Steven Brister, an acting Newark Municipal Court judge and a part-time judge in the East Orange Municipal Court, admitted to making ""gratuitous improper commentary"" based on his religious beliefs while hearing a domestic violence case this year, according to his response to a complaint filed against him.

He says he has since reflected on his words and taken steps to correct his conduct.

""The best analysis is that the comments were well-meaning but undeniably misguided,"" Brister says in his response to the complaint filed on Friday with the Supreme Court of New Jersey Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct.
The complaint was filed against him in February, just days after he offered the unsolicited advice to a defendant facing multiple counts of domestic violence.

""We get frustrated and ... in our frustration you can't come at them like [you're] Mike Tyson and they're in the ring like they're Leon Spinks. You can't do it. You can't punch, you can't hit,"" Brister told the defendant, according to a transcript of the hearing included in the complaint. ""At best, you treat as if you're holding a feather, just to let them know you're the man and you're in control.""

At the time, Brister characterized the advice as something he tells ""a lot of people with this same charge.""
During a July 30 hearing before the advisory committee, Brister said that while serving as an altar boy he was taught the biblical story of how Eve was created from ""the curved rib of a man,"" Adam, scripture he also shared with the domestic violence defendant.

""So if you believe in the creation from a higher power, then that curve is the creation of the woman with the curve of the rib of Adam,"" Brister told the committee.
The complaint, however, contends Brister violated several canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct which ""requires judges to decide cases according to the law and facts and not permit family, social, political, financial or other relationships or interests to influence their judicial conduct or judgment,"" according to the complaint.
In his response to the complaint, Judge Brister admitted he ""did mistakenly assimilate his personal religious beliefs into his judicial role and failed to conform his conduct to the high standards of conduct expected of judges and impugned the integrity of the Judiciary ...,"" according to the complaint.

A disciplinary hearing is expected to be scheduled for Brister, which could result in him being publicly censured, admonished, reprimanded, suspended or removed from the bench, according to the New Jersey Courts website. "
'He paid the ultimate sacrifice': Fellow officers mourn slain sheriff,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fellow-officers-mourn-alabama-sheriff-john-williams-paid/story?id=67435816,"
A devoted Alabaman sheriff who was gunned down in the line of duty was mourned Monday by fellow grieving officers.

Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams, known as ""Big John,"" was fatally shot on Nov. 23 while responding to a call in Hayneville, about 25 miles from Montgomery.

Williams, a 62-year-old husband and father, was born in Lowndes County. He served with the Hayneville Police Department before joining the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department in 1987.

He was elected sheriff in 2010.
""Nobody had to question John's integrity,"" Heath Taylor, Russell County Sheriff and president of the Alabama Sheriff's Association, said at Monday's funeral at the Garrett Coliseum in Montgomery.
Williams responded to a gas station that night at 8:15 when he was shot. The suspect, William Chase Johnson, 18, immediately fled the store on foot before he was captured after state officials issued an emergency alert to search for him.

Johnson has been charged with his murder. It was not immediately clear if he has entered a plea.

Taylor said Williams, despite being a sheriff, didn't pass on the responsibility to answer the call.

""Just like he had done thousands of times before over the last 32 years,"" Taylor said. ""That was the type of love he had for his community. He paid the ultimate sacrifice for each and every one of us in this coliseum.
""He was a man of honor and pride and respect for others,"" Taylor said, overcome with emotion. ""Nothing made him happier than helping somebody in Lowndes County.""
Among the Alabama sheriffs who spoke at the service was Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham, who said he and Williams ""went everywhere together.""

""He loved being the sheriff,"" Cunningham said. ""He would give you the shirt off his back. He's a true law enforcement officer.""Our GCSO Honor Guard is in attendance at the funeral service for Lowndes County Sheriff John “Big John” Williams. #BlueLivesMatter #ThinBlueLine 💙 pic.twitter.com/tQs1V68U8ZOur Honor Guard is in Montgomery to pay respects to Lowndes County Sheriff ""Big John"" Williams at his funeral today.

"How Lou Pearlman deceived *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys",https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-nsync-town-learning-truth-lou-pearlman-heart/story?id=67630216,"
Boy bands Backstreet Boys and  *NSYNC helped define an era of pop culture in the '90s.

But while they were performing for sold-out arenas and selling millions of albums, their then-manager Lou Pearlman was reaping most of the financial benefits.

*NSYNC members Lance Bass and Chris Kirkpatrick, the members of O-Town and solo artist Sean van der Wilt spoke to ""20/20"" about their experiences with the notorious music mogul, who they say took advantage of their trust and took advantage of them financially.

""I was in the biggest band in the world and selling millions of records…but I can't even afford my apartment in Orlando. I couldn't even get a car,"" Bass told ""20/20.""

Watch the full story on ""20/20"" FRIDAY, Dec. 13 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC
""[Pearlman] could get anything he wanted,"" said O-Town member Jacob Underwood. ""I feel like [he was] just a miserable person who wanted all these things, and then got them, and [was] still miserable. … That's a very sick, sad man to be around.""

Pearlman pleaded guilty in 2008 to conspiracy, money laundering and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding in connection to a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving his TransContinental empire. He died in 2016 at age 62 while serving a 25-year prison sentence.

""When I found out about the Ponzi scheme, my heart broke and was basically ripped out, because now I realized he was a conman,"" Kirkpatrick said.
Bass helped bring the extent of Pearlman's schemes and deception to light in his YouTube Originals documentary, ""The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story,"" which debuted in April.

""I knew he was a scamster,"" Bass said. ""It was one of the many jaw-dropping things that I discovered in producing 'The Boy Band Con.'""

Pearlman was running a blimp business when he decided to start a boy band. At the time, New Kids on the Block was enormously popular.

In 1991, according to Forbes magazine, NKOTB made more money than Madonna or Michael Jackson. Pearlman was blown away by how much money NKOTB was making.

""I was invited to come down to one of their [New Kids on the Block] shows, all the [fans] screaming, I was like, 'My God, what's going on here,'"" Pearlman told ""20/20"" in a 2000 interview. ""And these girls were buying these t-shirts and hats and chains and posters. I was like, 'Man, this is exciting.' I mean, not to mention, OK, there's a tinkle into the cash register. No question about it… I said, 'I think I can do that. I think I can put a group like that together.'""
Pearlman, a Queens, New York, native, had moved to Orlando, Florida, in the early 1990s. He put an ad in the Orlando Sentinel that said: Producer seeks male teen singers that move well between 16 and 19 years of age, wanted for a New Kids type singing dance group.

""Florida is a great place to be if you want to start a boy band because there's a lot of young talent down there auditioning for roles at the theme parks,"" John Seabrook, a journalist and author of the book, ""The Song Machine,"" told ""20/20.""

A.J. McLean, Howie Dorough and Nick Carter all auditioned for Pearlman.

""Those are the three originals and we needed five,"" said Jeanne Tanzy Williams, who originally managed McLean but also became co-manager of the group for a short time. ""Lou Pearlman actually found Kevin [Richardson] at a Disney parade… playing Aladdin.""

Once Richardson signed on, Tanzy Williams said Richardson recommended his cousin, Brian Littrell, who at the time sang at church in their home state of Kentucky. With Littrell onboard, Pearlman had his first boy band in the making.
Williams said Pearlman established a sort of boy band boot camp, providing them with choreographers, voice coaches and tutors. The boys practiced for hours in extremely hot conditions in Pearlman’s blimp hangar in Kissimmee, Florida.

In May 1993, Backstreet Boys made their first public appearance at SeaWorld. Pearlman made a tape of the performance and sent it around to people in the industry.

Johnny Wright and his then-wife Donna, who were the road managers for New Kids on the Block, saw the tape and thought the boys had something special.
""What I had heard about him prior to meeting him [was] that he was a billionaire,"" Johnny Wright said. ""He runs around in a Rolls Royce, he owns all these blimps. He also told me he was a writer and a producer. I had no reason to doubt anything that he was telling me at that time, and he had already put the band together. I just felt like, 'Hey, we lucked into something here.'""

Johnny and Donna Wright became Backstreet Boys' managers; Jeanne Tanzy Williams says Pearlman told her she was out. The boys were sent out on a tour performing at high schools.

""They would do three shows a day in three different schools,"" Johnny Wright told ""20/20."" ""They would bust out on the gym floor and the girls would lose their mind and they had never heard of them before.""

Backstreet Boys had a hard time getting a record deal at first but eventually they were signed by Jive Records. Pearlman pressured them to sign a contract that was heavily weighted in his favor. In addition to being their manager, Pearlman made himself the sixth member of the band,  meaning that he would reap additional financial rewards.

Pearlman defended his business practices to ""20/20"" in a 2000 interview, saying in part, ""Backstreet Boys is a part of my life as much as it is theirs.""

With a record deal signed, the boys needed to find good material. Jive had a relationship with some Swedish producers and they sent Backstreet Boys to Stockholm to work with young producer-songwriters Max Martin and the late Denniz Pop. Martin and Pop had written hits for the group Ace of Base.

Max Martin would go on to become one of the most successful hit makers of our time. He wrote the Britney Spears song “…Baby One More Time.” He co-wrote Katy Perry’s “Roar” and he co-wrote “Shake It Off” with Taylor Swift.

With Backstreet Boys in the early '90s, he co-wrote, “We’ve Got It Going On,” with Pop, which became a huge hit in Europe for the group. German audiences in particular went wild for Backstreet Boys.
“At that point in time boy bands were big in Germany,” Wright said. “I knew if they had their best shot, it was in a market where boy bands were super successful… We used to call America, ‘no fan land.’”

Martin also co-wrote Backstreet Boys' hit, “Quit Playing Games with My Heart.” It was that song and famous music video that made the group successful in the United States. The song was No. 2 on the charts in 1997.

As Backstreet Boys' fame grew, Pearlman secretly started working on putting together his next boy band. This new group became *NSYNC and it was made up of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Lance Bass.

""When I first sat down with Lou…  he had it in his mind that he was ready to have another band,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""So right away I was totally in. But he had this weird-- it was always like a secret. Like, everything was, you know, 'I'm doing this, but I'm also working with them. So don't tell anybody about this. Don't say that I'm involved with you. Don't say that you really even know me, but I'm going to try to help you guys out.'""

Kirkpatrick said he suggested Pearlman consider Timberlake for the new band.

“When I got a hold of Justin-- the first thing Justin's mom suggested was, ‘He's been working really closely with one of his friends from ‘The Mickey Mouse Club’… JC [Chasez],"" Kirkpatrick said.

Both Timberlake and Chasez had been cast members on the Disney variety show, “The All-New Mickey Mouse Club,” when it ended production in 1994 and were looking for other opportunities. Kirkpatrick then suggested Joey Fatone, whom he knew from his days performing at Universal.

They had four, but Pearlman wanted a five-part harmony, so they needed one more.

“We needed to find the bass,” Kirkpatrick said. “Justin's vocal coach had called and said, ‘I've got this kid out of  Mississippi and I want you to hear him.'""

That kid was Lance Bass.
""My love of music really began [with] singing in my church,"" Bass said. ""In Mississippi, no one ever dreamt of being a successful musician. It just was kind of out the cards for someone like me.""

Bass was a sophomore in high school when he got the call that he said changed his life. He said Pearlman and Timberlake asked him to fly to Orlando to audition -- it was Bass' first time on a plane.

""I arrive at baggage claim, and there's 14-year-old Justin Timberlake sitting on the baggage belt looking really cool and sly, and I'm like, 'Wow…this kid's cool,'"" Bass said. ""Then you have Lou Pearlman. And they pull up in…a limo and a Rolls Royce, and that's how I'm introduced to this whole world.""
Bass said he instantly liked Pearlman after meeting him for the first time.

""When you meet Lou you immediately trust him for some reason. He had…a jolly personality that you…felt like he was family,"" Bass said. ""And when you see Lou…with his Rolls Royces and limos and his beautiful mansion…you trusted that he knew what he was doing just because of all the things he had.""

As he had done with Backstreet Boys, Pearlman put the *NSYNC members into a boot camp of sorts with choreographers, voice lessons and tutors. Bass said they would practice dance moves for hours in Pearlman’s blimp hangar, which Bass says would get incredibly hot.

""And at that time…Lou Pearlman funded our group,"" Bass said. ""So he rented us our house, so we didn't have to pay for rent. He would pay for dinners when we would go out for dinners… He's family to you. He's taking care of you.""

*NSYNC made its first public appearance at Disney’s Pleasure Island in October 1995. Word got back to Johnny Wright who was touring with Backstreet Boys in Germany that Pearlman had another band.

""I called Lou and I was like, 'You have another boy band I don't know about?' He was, 'No, no, no.' He goes, 'This kid Chris Kirkpatrick…wants to put a band together and he just comes to me every once in a while to ask for some advice, but I got nothing to do with that band,'"" Wright said.

""Backstreet Boys...were worried about *NSYNC. They were actually concerned…they were going to put them out of business,"" Seabrook said. ""So when Backstreet Boys found out that Lou Pearlman was the manager behind their greatest rival…they were outraged.""

Pearlman started TransContinental Records, an indie label. However, it was still in its infancy, so he needed a major U.S. record label for distribution -- a feat that would prove difficult.

""Every record exec out there turned us down,"" Bass said. ""They were like, 'Nothing like this would ever work in America. This is way too cheesy.'""

""Our clothes were just horrible,"" he added. ""They were always just oversized. No one really cared. There was no stylist that came in and was like, 'Oh we're going to do this and we're going to fit you.' No, it was, like, 'Here's a rack of stuff.'""

At the time, boy bands were still in demand in Germany. So, following the same formula as Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC went to Europe to perform and worked with Max Martin, who co-wrote *NSYNC’s first two hits, “I Want You Back” and “Tearing Up My Heart.”

“In Europe, we were on the cover of every magazine,” Bass said. “And then when we released our first single and album, it blew up. It was huge.”

Bass said *NSYNC’s trajectory in the U.S. changed once the group performed at a Disney concert that Backstreet Boys had turned down. The Disney Channel played the concert over and over.

“The Disney Channel concert really changed our career,” Bass said. “It was incredible, and that one gig right there, to me, is what made us in America.”
But while *NSYNC's star was rising, Bass said Backstreet fans ""were mad. They were like, ‘Oh we can't have another group like this.’ So it was a hard start for us…and that's when the rivalry started with the fans.”

In 1998, *NSYNC had two albums on the charts -- their self-titled debut album and their Christmas album, “Home For Christmas,” which featured the song “Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.”

“To this day, I think the Christmas album's one of my favorite albums that we've ever done,” Kirkpatrick said. “It's timeless. And as soon as that thing came out, then it's more videos and next single on the record. And we were just holding on for the ride.”

“We'd get so busy we didn't have time to cut our hair or to put bleach in our hair,” Bass added. “So that's when I started just kind of getting this bleach and putting it in my hair and just putting my fingertips in it, and that's how the frosted tips were born.”

In the background, Pearlman was using the success of Backstreet Boys, and later *NSYNC, to not only lure new talent, but also to use the bands’ enormous success to entice people to invest in Pearlman’s TransContinental empire, which eventually he claimed included the record label, plus an airline, a film and music studio, talent and travel agencies as well as restaurants and real estate.
""We never ever flew on a TransContinental airplane,"" Bass said. ""We would fly to different places over in Europe, and we'd always be on these Delta flights, you know, in coach. And I always thought it was weird that someone that was in the airline industry couldn't help us out a little bit [with] getting to places.""

Meanwhile, after years of touring, selling out arenas and promoting albums, both Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC were starting to wonder when they were going to get paid.

""With all the success you would think that we were making hand-over-fist money and we were printing money and whatever, and it just wasn't the case,"" Kirkpatrick said.
In 1998, Bass and Kirkpatrick said Pearlman flew them and their families out to Los Angeles for what he called a check presentation ceremony and a celebration dinner. Both said they went into the dinner thinking that they were about to become millionaires.

""At the end of the dinner, we have all these envelopes sitting in front of us… I knew my life was about to change,"" Bass said. ""I knew we had worked so hard. So I knew what that check should be or I was hoping would be…in the best of worlds, $1 million would've been, like, 'Oh my [God].' That's what I thought we deserved.""

But when they opened their checks, Bass said the amount was for $10,000 each.

""I didn't want to seem ungrateful because at that point, yes, $10,000 was a lot of money,"" Bass said. ""We went back to the hotel room and that's when it all just hit me. I was so disappointed. And I ripped up the check. Like… I knew something was wrong.""

The band had Chasez's uncle, who was an attorney, look over their contracts, and he called it ""the worst contract I've ever read in my entire life,'"" Bass said.

That's when Bass said *NSYNC discovered they had the same contracts as Backstreet Boys, where Pearlman legally had made himself the sixth member of their group, allowing him to rake in one-sixth of the band's profits, on top of taking in management fees.

After their attorneys found a small loophole in their contract with Pearlman's label TransContinential Records, *NSYNC jumped to Jive Records, the same record label as Backstreet Boys.

As a result, TransContinental Records, along with RCA parent BMG Entertainment -- the label that distributed *NSYNC albums --  hit the band with a $150 million breach-of-contract lawsuit in an effort to stop the move and stop them from performing or recording using the name *NSYNC, among other demands.

""[Pearlman] knew that we were able to sign with a different label but he still owned our name. He was the sixth member of the group and he owned the name *NSYNC. So he took our name and sued us.... so we could never use it,"" Bass said. ""And that's why we ended up in court.""
In 1998, Backstreet Boys filed a lawsuit, claiming that they had only received $300,000 since 1993 while Pearlman had made $10 million. Pearlman defended his business practices, saying that he had spent $3 million on Backstreet Boys to launch their careers before the band had been profitable.
Pearlman was ousted as Backstreet Boys' manager but the settlement agreement they reached gave him $30 million and he continued earning a portion of the band's profits.

In 1999, *NSYNC, Pearlman and BMG Entertainment reached a settlement which included giving *NSYNC members the right to control their name. As a result, Pearlman was also out as their manager.

The following year, in early 2000, *NSYNC its third album, “No Strings Attached.""

“'No Strings Attached’ just became the theme,” Kirkpatrick said. “It became our battle cry of, ‘We don't owe anybody anymore… we have no ties to anything but each other … and our fans.""

Despite the legal battles with his most profitable bands, Pearlman continued to seek opportunities to launch new bands and artists.
""We just thought that it was us and the Backstreet Boys and that's all that he was really focusing on right now, not knowing that he was developing tons of bands on the side,"" Bass said.

Pearlman went on to create a boy band called LFO, whose song ""Summer Girls"" peaked at No. 3 on the charts in 1999, as well as the bands C- Note, Take 5, the girl group Innosense and O-Town -- the winners of his TV show ""Making the Band,"" a franchise that began on ABC in 2000 and later moved to MTV.

""Lou Pearlman, for all of his faults, was an amazing casting director,"" said Dave Holmes, a judge on ""Making the Band."" ""He had an ear for a good voice but that was not the most important thing… The most important thing was charisma… He really saw things in people that would not blossom for years.”

But Bass said that when he saw O-Town come out of ""Making The Band"" in 2000, he initially felt sorry for the new group.

""Because at that point, I knew who Lou Pearlman was and I knew he was taking advantage of people and I knew what contract these guys would eventually be signing,"" Bass said.

Much like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, four members of O-Town said they also struggled with getting Pearlman to pay them. In their contract, Pearlman didn't make himself a legal member of the group but owned the rights to the band's name, which led to legal battles years later.

""He promised tour support -- we'd get a big tour -- and then the day of the tour support, no money comes in,"" Underwood said. ""Playing with our money, not able to get sponsorship because we have to get his clearance for the [band] name, and it just became a headache from day one.""
And as he'd done with Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, Pearlman ran the boys through somewhat of a boy band boot camp. He also encouraged all of his bands to call him, ""Big Poppa"" or ""Papa Lou.""

""He was 'Papa Lou' to Backstreet and he was 'Papa Lou' to us [*NSYNC], but we couldn't tell anybody he was 'Papa Lou,'"" Kirkpatrick said. ""He just was this fatherly figure that we never had any worries around him because … he was the money guy.""

""Some of it was really weird and awkward and uncomfortable. But, you know, for the most part, you know, it was just Lou,"" he added.

Rumors of Pearlman's being inappropriate with some of the young men he was managing circulated.

""The thing about Lou, there was an endearing childlike quality to him,"" said O-Town's Erik-Michael Estrada. ""You never automatically thought that there's something devious behind the requests… Playing chicken in the pool, 'Who's going to be on my shoulders?' Yeah, 'You look like you're tired. Let me give you a massage. Let me see your abs. Are they coming in?' None of those things seemed weird at the time.""

""I never saw anything until after we left,"" Bass said. ""There was rumblings of maybe Lou was sleeping with boys to get into groups and all that. So I don't know what was real, what wasn't.""

Singer and songwriter Sean van der Wilt has worked hard to build a successful career in Hollywood despite the rocky start he said he had working with Pearlman, who he says ""made many advances"" on him when he was signed to Pearlman's label in the early 2000s. Van der Wilt said the advances made him ""uncomfortable.""
""The first couple times he put his arm around -- was hugging me -- but it was in a way [that it] was just a little too close for comfort,"" van der Wilt said. ""By the third time, I was sitting on his bed, and he joked and fell on top of me. I was like, 'Whoa, Lou,' and he was like, 'Oh, come on. We're buddies.'""

Seth Abramovitch, who writes for The Hollywood Reporter, asked Pearlman about the rumors concerning inappropriate misconduct with some of his young performers. “His explanation was that anyone whose star he actually launched were happy with him. …..If their careers fizzled, they had a grudge, and that's why they said these things about him,” Abramovitch told ABC News.

By 2006, the feds were investigating Pearlman for running a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme related to his TransContinental empire. In 2008, Pearlman pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, one count of money laundering and one count of making a false claim in a bankruptcy proceeding. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Backstreet Boys has continued to achieve commercial success as a group. The band released a new album, ""DNA,"" and concluded a Las Vegas residency this year.
*NSYNC went ""on hiatus"" in 2002. They reunited this past April, without Timberlake, to perform with singer Ariana Grande at Coachella Music Festival.
After enjoying three years of success, O-Town disbanded in 2003. Underwood said their inability to own the rights to their band's name made it ""impossible"" to make music or market off their success.
In 2013, O-Town regrouped to launch a comeback and filed paperwork in 2017 to obtain the rights to their band's name. This year, however, they faced another legal hurdle: Universal Music Group is challenging the band's claim to the name ""O-Town,"" arguing that it's too similar to their trademarked Motown Recordings brand.

""Nobody else is paying for it or building it up -- it's us,"" Underwood said. ""After 20 years of being a band, [the label] decides that they think that O-Town and Motown are too close of a name and that people would confuse the two.""
Van der Wilt's career, though it had hit a bump, eventually started looking up again. He began working with Rihanna on a promo tour and booked a dancing role in the 2010 movie ""Burlesque."" Most recently, he worked with Cher as an associate choreographer and dancer, although he left that role to choreograph and appear in the ninth season of the FX show ""American Horror Story."" A producer on that show, he said, helped him land a choreography role on Fox's ""911: Lone Star."" He also just released a single called ""Silence.""

Van der Wilt said that although he considered Pearlman a friend, the music producer never apologized to him for everything he'd been put through, which included his getting kicked out of a California mansion that went into foreclosure due to nonpayment by Pearlman's company. Still, van der Wilt said he believes there was good in Pearlman.

""Lou did have a big heart. He did. He cared about people. It was very apparent. He [was] always hugging everybody. Everybody was his family and I know it deep down inside,"" he said. ""I know he meant that. It's just, his way of thinking with money and wanting all the attention was crooked. That's how I feel.""
When Pearlman died of heart failure behind bars in 2016, Bass said, ""I was so confused on exactly how to feel.""

""I'm like, 'How could you die right now when we don't have this closure? You need to apologize,'"" he continued.

""The minute…you'd start to cry, you'd start to laugh,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""And the minute you'd start to laugh, you'd start to get angry, and the minute I was angry, I started to feel bad for the whole thing that happened. It was the most confusing moment probably that I've ever had.""

""I know that a lot of the other guys are bitter,"" he added. ""I understand that because like I said, it's so many emotions. But…I wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for him… and it sucks.""

Looking back now, Bass said he feels glad to have known Pearlman.

""There's so many life lessons that you learn from everyone else's mistakes -- from your mistakes,"" Bass said. ""He helped start my career. He funded it… I don't know where I'd be without him. So you have to give him that credit.""

But others, like O-Town members Underwood and Dan Miller, say they feel differently.

""I don't feel like [Pearlman] is responsible for my career. But I know that there's other members of my band who feel conflicted because we have a career because of this band that he put together,"" Miller said. ""But he also is just a disgusting human being on so many levels.""

""The Ponzi scheme victims… We were all in it together. We were all abused by the same person,"" Underwood added. ""Hopefully you don't feel as lonely…as you did…because you have a big family now. We're all connected."""
FBI probing if Pensacola suspect watched mass-shooting videos prior to attack,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-probing-pensacola-naval-base-suspect-watched-mass/story?id=67578998,"
Investigators are probing a report that the suspect in the deadly Florida naval base shooting watched mass-shooting videos in the presence of some friends in the days leading up to the attack, two people briefed on the probe told ABC News.

Three people were killed during the shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday morning. The alleged shooter, identified by authorities as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, a Saudi national and second lieutenant the country's air force who was in the United States for flight training, was shot and killed at the scene by Escambia County Sheriff's deputies, authorities said.

""We are, as we do in most active shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,"" Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville, Florida, field office and the lead investigator on the Pensacola shooting, said at a news conference Sunday. ""This allows us to take advantage of investigative techniques that can help us move more quickly, identify and then eliminate any additional potential threats to the rest of our community.""
She emphasized the investigation has yet to find ""any information that indicates any additional potential threats to the rest of the community.""

Rojas said Alshamrani used a Model 45 Glock 9 mm handgun. She said the gun was purchased ""legally and lawfully"" in Florida but declined to release specific information on when and where.

""As we speak,"" Rojas said, ""members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI's Counterterrorism Division are working tirelessly to discern if any possible ideology ... may have been a factor in this attack.""

The shooting broke out in a classroom at the sprawling base just before 7 a.m. on Friday. The victims killed were identified Saturday night as Ensign Joshua Watson, 23, Airman Mohammed Haitham, 19, and Airman Apprentice Cameron Walters, 21.

The bodies of the victim were being taken to Dover Air Force Base on Sunday night, according to Rear Adm. Gary Mayers, commander of the Navy Region Southeast.

Walters' family released a statement on Sunday that read: ""He was a true friend, fun loving, genuine soul, great brother and son. Made us so proud. He had 3 brothers and three sisters who adored him.""
FBI agents also are trying to confirm whether the investigative lead that Alshamrani showed mass-shooting videos to friends is accurate and have been combing through his electronic devices for evidence of those videos. The information about the videos came from interviews with classmates of Alshamrani, sources told ABC News.

Investigators are being led to believe that this was not some sort of gathering called specifically to watch the videos or that the friends who were present were part of any plot. Investigators have been told the friends gathered with Alshamrani in an unplanned get-together in which Alshamrani apparently turned on the videos, the sources said.

Alshamrani is said to have wanted to ""pump"" himself up in the run-up to Friday's planned shooting, and the friends present were not aware that he was planning a lethal attack, sources said.
Rojas refused to comment on whether Alshamrani showed the mass-shooting videos at the recent gathering. But in a statement released Sunday afternoon, FBI officials said they have obtained and are reviewing digital evidence.

""This includes multiple videos from base security surveillance, as well as cellphone videos that were taken by a bystander from outside the building after the attack had started and after first responders had arrived. We have interviewed that person, and are analyzing the videos to determine if any details can further this investigation,"" the FBI statement reads.

The preliminary assessment of investigators is that the shooter was not connected to a group or a band of conspirators. Instead, it is believed he acted alone.

""Our main goal right now is to confirm whether he acted alone or was he part of a larger network,"" Rojas said at Sunday's news conference. ""We currently assess there was one gunman who perpetrated this attack and no arrests have been made in this case.""

She said 80 FBI special agents and task force officers have been assigned to the investigation and that nearly 100 professional staff in FBI field offices across the country were assisting in the probe.

""There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation,"" she added. ""Their Saudi commanding officer has restricted them to base, and the Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.""
Rojas disputed media reports that the FBI had been unable to track down some international students participating in the naval air training program at the base.

""I can report that the FBI is working side-by-side with the U.S. Navy and they have confirmed to us that they have 100% accountability on all international students from NAS Pensacola,"" Rojas said.

FBI agents are piecing together details of Alshamrani's life -- both in the United States and overseas.

A key part of the investigation is taking place in Texas, three people briefed on the probe told ABC News.

When Alshamrani was first deployed to the U.S. for flight training, he was assigned to Lackland Air Force Base, now part of Joint Base San Antonio. Preliminary information indicates he was at Lackland for a few months going through language training, which is standard for overseas military personnel sent to the U.S. for training, the sources said.
""Like everything in his history, it's being looked at,"" one source told ABC News.

A spokeswoman for the FBI's San Antonio field office declined to comment.

Rojas encouraged anyone with information on the shooting or Alshamrani whereabouts leading up to the shooting to contact the FBI immediately, saying no tip is ""too small.""

Alshamrani was a recent regular customer at the International Grocery & Halal Meat in Pensacola, owner Karmul Islam told ABC News on Sunday. He said Muslims from the Navy base are regular customers, and he quickly recognized a photo of Alshamrani showed to him by ABC News.

He said he couldn't recall what Alshamrani purchased at the store, only that he was a pleasant yet unremarkable customer who'd been coming in over the past few weeks. The last time he said he saw Alshamrani was about two weeks ago.

The shooting came just two days after an active-duty sailor allegedly opened fire on three civilian employees, killing two, at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard near Honolulu before taking his own life.

Authorities have found no evidence linking the two shootings.

On Wednesday, a 22-year-old naval sailor identified by the military as G. Romero allegedly opened fire on shipyard personnel at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard with his M4 service rifle and then used his M9 service pistol to shoot himself, the official said.

Three civilian Department of Defense workers were found shot in the vicinity of the base's Dry Dock 2. Two died, and a third was last reported to be in stable condition, according to Rear Adm. Robert Chadwick, commander, Navy Region Hawaii.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Sunday during an interview on Fox News that he's requested the Pentagon investigate the breach in security at the Pensacola base to determine if any corrective action needs to be taken immediately. He also asked the Pentagon to ""review of what our screening procedures are with regard to foreign nationals coming into the United States.""

Military experts said the training program in which Alshamrani was participating in Pensacola has been around for decades, drawing elite military officers from around the world.

""The program of training foreign nationals in the military is one of the best ways we build long-term relationships with countries all over the world, not just the Saudis,"" Michael ""Mick"" Mulroy, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense.

Mulroy and former Navy SEAL Eric Oehlerich, both ABC News contributors and founders of Lobo Institute, which provides consulting and teaching on current and future military conflicts, said most officers accepted into the program are thoroughly vetted.

""These are military officers of a partner nation who have applied and met some pretty high standards to be able to get into the program,"" Mulroy said.

Mulroy said there is also a practical component to the program: Teaching foreign pilots to fly jets the Defense Department sells to their countries.

""If that program is ended, so will the sales,"" Mulroy said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Sunday night that he suspects Alshamrani was ""a guy that had a deep-seeded hatred for the U.S.""

""My view,"" the governor said, ""is that for us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country. The fact of the matter is, bringing people from Saudi Arabia, you need to be on guard about that.""

Students asked to 'set your price for a slave' for assignment,https://abcnews.go.com/US/teacher-leave-assignment-students-set-price-slave/story?id=67664294,"
A Missouri teacher was placed on paid administrative leave after asking students to put a price on slaves for a school social studies assignment, a spokesperson for the school said.

The assignment was handed out to fifth grade students at Blades Elementary School in Oakville in an effort to teach them about the Colonial marketplace and the exchange of goods, according to a statement on Tuesday from the superintendent of the Mehlville School District, where the school is located.

However, one teacher included slaves ""as goods to be sold"" as part of the lesson, according to the statement.
""Asking a student to participate in a simulated activity that puts a price on a person is not acceptable,"" Superintendent Chris Gaines said. ""Racism of any kind, even inadvertently stemming from cultural bias, is wrong and is not who we aspire to be as a school district.""

The assignment, which was posted in full by KMOV, also asked students to set prices for 10 other items: grain, apples or tomatoes, codfish, herring, oil, milk, cow, wool, firewood, lumber and tar.

It was the last question that asked students to ""set your price for a slave.""

The teacher has not been identified, but a spokesperson for the school district confirmed the teacher was on paid administrative leave.
In a letter to parents at Blades Elementary School, Gaines said the teacher ""has expressed significant remorse""

The St. Louis County branch of the NAACP called the assignment ""unacceptable.""

""It’s very inhumane, it does not speak to us taking care of each other as human beings,"" President John Bowman, of the branch, said in a statement.

"Police: Whiskey, 92 liquor minibottles in car that hit teen",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-94-bottles-liquor-found-car-struck-teen-67542505,"
A  woman accused of driving off the road and killing a teenager in Maryland had two bottles of whiskey and 92 minibottles of liquor in the car, police said. 
Jennifer Jean Jones, 30, has been charged with negligent manslaughter by vehicle, Baltimore County police         said  Thursday. 
Charging documents say Jones crossed the double lines of a Dundalk road Tuesday, hitting Trinity Lynn Brooks, 15, and then kept going: hitting a tree, driving through a fence and into three backyards before coming to a stop. 
Police say two bottles of whiskey and 92 minibottles of liquor were found on the front passenger side floorboard.
Jones was found unconscious in the wrecked car, the documents state. First responders administered Narcan because they believed she was under the influence of opioids. The documents say she told police she had her last drink five minutes before the crash. Police say she admitted to drinking heavily every day and had been a heroin user.
Brooks was a freshman at Dundalk High School, Baltimore County schools spokesman Brandon Oland said. 
“It's obviously a very sad week at that school,” Oland said. “Our thoughts and wishes are with her family.”
A vigil for Brooks was held at the crash site Thursday. A visitation will be held Monday and funeral services will be Tuesday, according to news outlets. 
Jones waived her right to appear at her bail review Thursday. She's being held without bond at the Baltimore County Department of Corrections. It's unclear whether she had an attorney who could speak for her."
Harvey Weinstein posts $2M bond under state's new bail reform statute,https://abcnews.go.com/US/harvey-weinstein-posts-2m-bond-york-states-bail/story?id=67654901,"
A New York judge raised Harvey Weinstein’s bail package on Wednesday from $1 million to $5 million following claims that he violated his ankle bracelet monitoring requirements dozens of times.

Defense attorneys said after court that they would choose the option of posting a $2 million insurance bond to ensure their client’s freedom throughout his upcoming rape and sexual assault trial set to begin next month.

A new state bail reform statute that goes into effect next month required Manhattan Supreme Court Judge James Burke to reset Weinstein's bail package to include additional options.
Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to raping a woman in a hotel room in 2013 and committing a forcible sex act on a second woman in 2006. The movie mogul was previously out on $1 million cash bail and contends that the violent sex acts were consensual.
On Wednesday, Judge Burke ordered three new bail options for Weinstein to chose from in order to ensure his return to court as required under the new state criminal justice statute -- $5 million cash bail, $50 million security bond partially secured at 10% or a $2 million insurance company bond.

One of Weinstein's attorneys, Arthur Aidala, told the judge that Weinstein is expected to undergo back surgery on Thursday to relieve pain from an August car accident, but that he’s ready for trial on Jan. 6, 2020.

""There is nobody in this courtroom who wants Jan. 6 to take place more than Mr. Weinstein,"" Aidala said. ""He wants to have his name cleared for the whole world to know.""

If convicted, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison.
When Burke asked if Weinstein understood his need to continue to show up for court, the movie mogul replied that he had “every intention” to be there.

“I’ll be there before anybody,” he said.

Weinstein will continue to wear an ankle-monitoring bracelet. Earlier in the hearing, defense attorneys argued that approximately 57 ankle bracelet monitor violations reported to authorities in two months were all ""technical glitches"" that were remedied by October.

The bail reform legislation -- passed in April 2019 -- eliminates money bail and pretrial detention for nearly all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony defendants while preserving bail and detention as options in most violent felonies, according to the Center for Court Innovation.

Organs of boy accidentally killed saved 3 lives,https://abcnews.go.com/US/family-year-boy-killed-hunting-accident-grateful-organs/story?id=67489823,"
When 9-year-old Colton Williams' mother heard her son's organs had been used to save three lives, she cried tears of joy.

""She's just crying and crying on the phone and I said, 'What's going on?'"" Colton's grandfather, Vince Furtick, told ABC News on Tuesday. ""She said, 'We've had this horrible, horrible thing going on and here's a ray of sunshine.'""
Colton was killed on Thanksgiving in a hunting accident in Springfield, South Carolina, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Natural Resources told ABC News.

Details surrounding his death have not yet been released, but Furtick said the boy was out with his dad when the accident occurred.
Yet amid the tragedy, the family said the ""first positive"" has been the news that both of Colton's kidneys and his liver were donated to other families -- an effort that his mother, Caitlin, saw through.

""It just added some value to an otherwise senseless tragedy,"" Furtick said. ""It meant something to her that some part of him could carry on.""

He described Colton as a boy who was ""100% an outdoors-kind of guy."" He would always prefer a hunting rifle, fishing pole or basketball in his hands over a video game, according to Furtick.
He was also loved by the community. At Colton's funeral on Sunday, Furtick said he was stunned to see how many children came up to the family and said Colton was their best friend.

""A lot of them said that,"" his grandfather said. ""It's just heartbreaking to see him gone.""
While he said the family continues to grieve, the news of the organ donations has given them some solace. He hopes to meet those who now have Colton's organs soon and see, in person, how the boy's life has carried on.

""We're sitting here with our tears of grief while, at the same time, there are three families crying tears of joy,"" he said. ""We still got closure with our grandson and we still can help somebody else."""
Puppy with tail on his forehead adopted by founder of organization that rescued him,https://abcnews.go.com/US/puppy-named-narwhal-tail-forehead-adopted-founder-missouri/story?id=67470618,"
A ""perfectly healthy"" rescue puppy with a surprising physical feature that makes him extra special has now been adopted by the founder of the organization who made him famous

Narwhal, the 10-week-old furball who has a small tail-like growth on his forehead, was adopted by Rochelle Steffen, the founder of Mac's Mission -- a nonprofit dog rescue that predominately helps pups with special needs
Steffen told ABC News last month that they found the adorable light brown dog, thought to be a dachshund and beagle mix, at a dump site in rural Jackson, Missouri, where she said ""hundreds"" [of dogs] have been dumped.

""He had x-rays and a vet visit ... and is a perfectly healthy puppy, with an extra tail on his face,"" Steffen said. ""There is no medical need to remove it currently and it is a third the size of his actual tail.""
""He is in no pain and plays for hours,"" she added.

A few weeks after the story went viral, Steffen has now decided to house the dog herself.

""I had no intention initially of keeping him,"" Steffen told the Southeast Missourian. ""It’s not just a decision from me. The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him.""
Steffen told the outlet that the rescue organization received hundreds of applications from people who wanted to rescue the dog, but decided that the dog is no longer for sale.

She also feared the dog might be exploited.

""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said, adding that she plans to train Narwhal as a therapy dog.
Mac's Mission focuses on helping dogs with deformity, clefts and trauma ""since those get euthanized far more than any others and there is a great need to give them a chance,"" Steffens told ABC News. ""We give them that chance.""
Because the nonprofit's life-saving efforts are strictly grassroots through social media, Steffens explained that Narwhal's story getting so much attention has been ""majorly epic for so many new folks to find out about our little awesome rescue.""

""We really love our little Narwhal and the others he is helping here with the attention!""

Video shows 17-year-old hold open mosque doors as students run from school stabbing,https://abcnews.go.com/US/video-shows-17-year-girl-hold-open-mosque/story?id=67504076,"
A 17-year-old girl is being praised for her ""remarkable"" actions after surveillance video showed her opening her mosque and ushering in students running from an alleged stabbing at their Wisconsin high school.

Duaa Ahmad, a senior at Oshkosh West High School, could be seen holding open the door to Oshkosh Ahmadiyya Muslims mosque and ushering in dozens before she herself went in.

""I just felt like I did what had to be done,"" Ahmad told ABC News in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Chaos ensued Tuesday morning after a 16-year-old student stabbed a school resource officer, who shot the student once at the high school, which was across from the mosque, according to Oshkosh Chief of Police Dean Smith.

Their injuries are expected to be non-life-threatening, authorities said.
While Ahmad said she felt ""a little fear,"" she was mainly focused on getting everyone inside.

She said that just minutes before, a teacher told students to run from the campus, but they didn't know why.

""It could have been anything. That fact that we didn't know caused even more anxiety,"" Ahmad said.
Yet, thankfully, she and other students exited through a door close to the mosque and everyone beelined toward it.

""I'm lucky that I was in that place when that situation ensued, and I'm just grateful that I was able to enter the code and let as many people in,"" Ahmad said.
While she didn't consider her actions heroic, her father and uncle were stunned when they saw the video.

""When I look at the video now, I feel pride,"" Saad Ahmad, her father, told ABC News.

""Her composure is remarkable in that situation,"" he said. ""I don't know how I would react in that situation.""

He added that while she looked calm, ""she was also scared.""
Duaa Ahmad's uncle, Khurram Ahmad, called it an ""uplifting"" moment in a terrifying situation.

""At first you see it, and you don't consider the subtlety in it that she remained outside,"" her uncle said. ""These are things that cannot be taught.""

He also serves as the public affairs secretary for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, to which the Oshkosh mosque belongs.
He said about 100 students from the school ran to the mosque and sought shelter there, thanks to his niece.

""At that moment, it was her alone. Her basic instinct kicked in,"" Khurram Ahmad said.

Duaa Ahmad is now focused on returning to school Friday and moving forward as a community, but she hopes that people will remember how terrifying these situations are.

""You never what that situation's gonna be like,"" she said, ""until you've actually experienced.""

Family's Christmas tree farm offers customers 'little bit of magic',https://abcnews.go.com/US/familys-christmas-tree-farm-offers-customers-bit-magic/story?id=67698711,"
It’s that time of year again and with just two weeks left, you probably have your Christmas tree up and decorated -- or maybe you don't and are still looking.

Enter Holiday Tree Farms in Corvallis, Oregon, one of the largest Christmas tree farms in the world.
It's been owned and operated by the Schudel family since 1955, first founded by Hal Schudel and now run by his sons John and Steve.
""There's a little bit of horticulture, a little bit of agriculture and a little bit of magic that goes into the whole thing,"" nursery manager Scott Godwin told ABC News recently.

Godwin has been in the nursery for five years, helping his team grow the next generation of Christmas trees.
""It's a really great feeling that each one of these [trees] were handled by hand by hundreds of people over the course of about 10 years before it's delivered to its final customer,"" he said. ""Of course, it's my favorite time of year. It's Christmas!""

John Schudel said that when his father Hal started the business, he was harvesting around 30,000 to 40,000 trees yearly.
""Today, we are shipping approximately 1 million trees per year,"" he said proudly.

The one million trees are planted across 7,500 acres and the process takes up to 900 employees, as well as a few helicopters, to get some of the heaviest trees to the truck.
""It takes a lot of people that are very committed, working 24/7...to cut the trees, load trucks…to get them where they need to be at the right time and in the right condition to make it an incredible experience for our customers,"" said worker Jeff Larcam, part of the third generation of the Schudel family.There's a little bit of horticulture, a little bit of agriculture and a little bit of magic that goes into the whole thing.
Once the trees are cut, they are wrapped and sent to a warehouse in Los Angeles where they are then distributed to tree stands and farms everywhere.
""Just doing this for Christmas, once you do it for the first year, it's in your blood,"" said Alias Lopez, who has been working at the warehouse for 28 years. ""The scent of the Christmas trees, once they're in Los Angeles, everybody knows we're in town.""

Lindsey George was recently shopping with her family for a tree 90 miles south in Fallbrook, California, at Vineyard 1924, where Santa was also visiting children and checking lists twice.

""You wait all year for your Christmas tree and it’s nice knowing that people care so deeply about their own farm and what they’re doing,"" George told ABC News. ""And we get the opportunity to bring it into our home.""

""We decided to go all natural, U.S.A.-grown trees."" said Rob Godwin, who was also tree shopping with his family. ""Best there is!"""
"Nazi salute photo leads to firings, suspensions for corrections workers",https://abcnews.go.com/US/west-virginia-corrections-workers-suspended-disturbing-nazi-salute/story?id=67532626,"
Three corrections employees in West Virginia have been fired over an image of them performing a Nazi salute.

The state's Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced the firings, which included two correctional academy trainers and one of the Basic Training Class #18 cadets in the photo, on Friday as authorities investigated the image. The department initially only announced suspensions of the employees in a letter on Wednesday, calling the image ""distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive and completely inappropriate.""
In addition to those were fired, another 34 were suspended without pay, according to the department.

The offensive image, which was printed on state letterhead, showed about 30 trainees in uniform displaying the Nazi salute under a sign that read ""HAIL BYRD!"" The Basic Training Class No. 18 was conducted Oct. 21 through Nov. 27.
ABC News obtained a copy of the photo from the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety.

Jeff Sandy, the director of the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety, said in a statement that the names of those in the photo will not be released until the investigation is complete. He said the end of the investigation was near.
""We are committed to a full and complete investigation that we will present to Governor Justice and to the public once it is finished,"" Sandy said. ""As terrible as this incident has been, it is critically important that we go by the book to arrive at the whole truth of what occurred and why.""

He had previously said he condemned the image in ""the strongest possible terms,"" Sandy wrote in a letter. ""It betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.""
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that those in the photo ""deserve to be exposed,"" but he doesn't know legally if he is able to identify them.

""We should, and do, condemn these actions in every way shape, form or fashion,"" Justice said at a press conference.

He said that while it would be easy for him to say ""it's a bad thing, but we got to move on ... I don't want you to move on past it because it's just that important.""

West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Commissioner Betsy Jividen has ordered that all copies of the image be destroyed, sent to her office or otherwise taken out of circulation ""to keep its harm from spreading,"" according to a letter sent to employees.

New details in death of 3-year-old who fell from airport escalator,https://abcnews.go.com/US/details-death-year-fell-airport-escalator/story?id=67528442,"
Authorities in North Carolina are shedding more light on the tragic September escalator accident that left a 3-year-old dead.

Charlotte Mecklenburg Police say that on the evening of Sept. 25, three children were playing near an escalator at the baggage claim in Charlotte Douglas International Airport, unsupervised. Police say they can substantiate their claim with surveillance video that captured Lightner and her children “from the moment they got off the plane..until the childs [sic] fall from the escalator.” In the hour before the fall, police say the children can be seen playing near or on the escalator while the mother is nowhere in view on the video.

Right before 9 p.m., 3-year-old Jaiden Cowart and his sister can be seen grabbing hold of the escalator railing from the outside and holding on as it goes up.

Police said the girl fell and a witness was able to catch her. But another camera at the top of the escalator shows Jaiden's hands nearing the top when he appears to lose his grip and fall 20 feet, police said.
An airport worker wrote in a separate report that he saw the boy suffer “major trauma to the head.” This worker said he called for a medic while “frantic” passengers swarmed the scene, asking him to “do something.” Police said Jaiden was laying in ""a large pool of blood.""

Jaiden was taken to Atrium Health Hospital where he died three days later.

Lightner told ABC Affiliate WSOC in October that she and her kids had returned home from a trip to Florida and that they were picking up luggage when Jaiden went up the escalator and fell.
Police said Lightner ""allowed substantial risk of physical injury...by allowing the child to play, unsupervised, on an airport escalator.""

Lightner told police that she was sitting on the stairs, watching her other children when Jaiden fell to the floor.

Lightner was arrested two weeks ago and was charged with three counts of misdemeanor child abuse, according to records from the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office. She was released from jail the same evening."
Jewish deli killing to be investigated as domestic terrorism: Officials,https://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-hates-suspects-religious-literature-eyed-motive-jersey/story?id=67683625,"
A pair of armed suspects, one wielding an AR-15 style rifle, who killed three people at a Jewish supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey, moments after gunning down a police detective in a cemetery appear to have been motivated by ""both anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement"" sentiments, officials said on Thursday.

The suspects, David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, were killed in an hourslong shootout with police on Tuesday but left a trail of potential evidence investigators are combing through to determine why they allegedly killed Jersey City police Det. Joseph Seals and targeted the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket, officials said.
""Based on what we have collected so far, including based on recent witness interviews, we believe that the suspects held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people as well as a hatred of law enforcement,"" New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said at a news conference.

Grewal said killings are now being investigated as ""potential acts of domestic terrorism fueled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs.""

Craig Carpenito, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation will take the lead in the probe.
""The motivation clearly appears to be a bias towards both the Jewish community and law enforcement,"" Carpenito said. ""This is going to be investigated going forward ... as a domestic terrorism event.""

The announcement came after law enforcement sources told ABC News that investigators had found religious writings by the suspects expressing hate.

In a stolen U-Haul van, the suspects parked in front of the kosher market just seconds before launching a rifle attack. Investigators found a pipe bomb and religious writings, including a handwritten note reading, ""I do this because my creator makes me do this and I hate who he hates,"" multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Grewal said five firearms were found at the scene, one an AR-15 style rifle that security video showed Anderson firing as he entered the supermarket around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday.
""We also recovered a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which we believe Francine Graham was carrying as she entered the supermarket,"" Grewal said.

Investigators also recovered from inside the store two other guns the suspects were armed with -- a 9mm Ruger semiautomatic handgun and a 9mm Glock 17, he said.

Inside the U-Haul van the suspects were driving, investigators also found a .22-caliber Ruger Mark IV handgun equipped with a homemade silencer and a homemade device to catch shell casings, Grewal said.

He said investigators recovered ""several hundred shell casings"" at the scene which investigators are processing to determine how many were fired by the suspects and how many were fired by the police.
Grewal said that based on two of the guns' serial numbers, the Mossberg shotgun and the .22-caliber Ruger, were legally purchased in 2018 by Graham at different gun shops in Ohio.

""At this point, our evidence indicates that the shooters were aiming their fire at law enforcement officers only and not at others on the street,"" Grewal said.

He said the investigation, so far, has found no accomplices involved. He also said investigators have learned that Anderson and Graham expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, a group that espouses hatred toward Jews and is known for anti-government and anti-police sentiments.

""We have not definitively established any formal links to that organization or to any other group. Based on the available evidence we believe that the two shooters were acting on their own,"" Grewal said.

Meanwhile, thousands of members of the Jewish Orthodox communities in Jersey City and Brooklyn, New York, gathered at cemeteries Wednesday night to mourn and bury two of the victims, 33-year-old Mindy Ferencz, the wife of the kosher supermarket owner and mother of five, and 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch, a Yeshiva student.
Deutsch's father, Abe Deutsch, is a member of the United Jewish Organization's board of directors, said Rabbi David Niederman, president of the organization.

“A few hundred bullets went into the body of a 24-year-old child ... how can we as a community, as people, bear that?” Niederman said of Moshe Deutsch, during a news conference Wednesday at City Hall in New York City.

The third victim killed at the supermarket was identified by authorities as Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, who worked at the store. Funeral arrangements for Rodriguez are pending.

A funeral for Det. Seals, 39, a married father of five, is scheduled to be held next Tuesday.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the Jersey City incident is a wakeup call.

""The murder of innocent civilians because of their religious beliefs, and the murder of a police officer for the simple reason that he was a police officer, must be the wakeup call to those who fail to see or acknowledge the rising tide of hate here in New Jersey, and around the nation,”  Murphy said in a statement. “This is our signal to come together as the broad New Jersey family we are and recommit to the elimination of hate in all its forms.""

The terrifying episode began to unfold about 12:38 p.m. on Tuesday when the Jersey City Police Department received a 911 call from an individual who discovered Seals' body in the Bayview Cemetery, about a mile from the kosher market, Grewal said on Wednesday.
He said investigators believe Seals was shot to death when he confronted the suspects in Bayview cemetery. He said Anderson and Graham were prime suspects in the murder this past weekend of an Uber driver officials identified as Michael Rumberger.

Rumberger's body was found in the trunk of a Lincoln Town car around 10 p.m. Saturday, sources told ABC News.

Seals apparently had gone to the cemetery alone to meet the suspects and one of them may have been an informant he had worked with, possibly explaining why he felt comfortable meeting in the cemetery without backup or radioing in about the rendezvous, the sources said.
Seals, a plainclothes undercover detective, had been investigating the homicide, according to law enforcement sources.

After allegedly killing Seals in the cemetery, the suspects got into the stolen U-Haul van and drove to the kosher market, arriving about 12:43 p.m., Grewal said.

Security video, obtained by ABC News, shows the suspects parking directly across the street from the supermarket on Martin Luther King Drive, getting out of the vehicle holding rifles and calmly walking into the supermarket as passersby on the street scrambled for cover.
Grewal said four people, including the three slain victims, were inside the store when the suspects stormed through the front door. A lone survivor, who was shot and wounded, managed to escape, Grewal said.
Two foot-patrol officers were about a block from the deli and responded as soon as they heard the gunfire, Grewal said. They were both shot and wounded in a gunfight with the suspects that involved other Jersey City police officers, he said.

The gunbattle lasted until about 3:47 p.m. when a police armored vehicle broke through the entryway of the supermarket and police found the bodies of the suspects and the three victims inside.

In addition to the two other officers wounded in the shootout, a third was hurt by shrapnel, officials said. The officers were all treated at a hospital and released.

FBI renews quest to find US citizen among most wanted terrorists in the world,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-renews-quest-find-american-born-jehad-serwan/story?id=67451940,"
He was born and raised in the San Diego area, but now the FBI and federal prosecutors in Southern California believe 37-year-old Jehad Serwan Mostafa is the highest-ranking U.S. citizen fighting overseas with a foreign terrorist organization.

Officials unsealed a new indictment against Mostafa on Monday alleging his leadership of the terrorist organization al-Shabaab has led to hundreds of innocent victims being hurt or killed in Africa.

Mostafa was originally charged in 2009 with similar counts of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Under the new superseding indictment, additional acts of violence allegedly led by Mostafa from 2009 to 2017 have been added to the case against him.
The FBI is also reaffirming a $5 million reward for information that leads to the capture of Mostafa, who federal officials call an extremely dangerous terrorist leader. FBI leaders worry that Mostafa’s U.S. roots could pose a danger to Americans at home or internationally because of a recent call inside al-Shabaab for attacks on U.S. citizens.

""We must use every tool in our toolbox to disrupt a potential terrorist attack before it happens,"" said Scott Brunner, FBI special agent in charge of the San Diego Field Office.
Mostafa remains a key figure on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist List. He has been on that list for years. FBI agents are asking citizens around the world to look at his picture and to listen to his voice to help in their attempts try to locate Mostafa.

""The FBI, the US Attorney’s Office, and the State Department have continued an extensive investigation since 2010 to locate this terrorist,"" explained Brunner. ""The FBI has not forgotten, has not stopped working, and will not stop until Mostafa is found.""
Agents believe Mostafa has been leading al-Shabaab’s explosives department and has been involved in the use of improvised explosive devices.

Mostafa grew up in the San Diego area and attended the University of California, San Diego. He graduated from UCSD in 2004 and the next year traveled to Yemen and Somalia where he fought against Ethiopian forces. He joined al-Shabaab in approximately 2006 and federal officials say he began rising in the terrorist group’s ranks.

They believe Mostafa is in Somalia right now.

Federal prosecutors in San Diego argue al-Shabaab’s attacks have injured and killed local residents. A 2010 suicide bombing at a bar in Uganda during a World Cup soccer match killed a U.S. citizen working for a San Diego nonprofit. The 2013 attack on a shopping mall in Kenya killed and injured dozens, including a graduate of a San Diego-area high school.

Elderly couple found dead in snow likely died of hypothermia: Authorities,https://abcnews.go.com/US/elderly-couple-found-dead-snow-died-hypothermia-arizona/story?id=67578852,"
An elderly couple found in the snow-filled field of an Arizona home likely died of hypothermia, according to authorities.

The man and woman, both in their 70s, were discovered off Crookton Road in Ash Fork, about 140 miles north of Phoenix, on Friday, officials from the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.
Homeowners Mike and Diane Haas noticed two bodies under the snow in their yard when they were leaving the house and called 911, they told ABC Phoenix affiliate KNXV.

“I said 'Sir, sir!' and of course they didn’t respond,"" Mike Haas said. ""It came pretty obvious pretty quick, their skin color and other details that they were deceased.""
The couple's car was found one mile away from the home, KNXV reported. They lived nearby and attempted to walk after their car got stuck in the snow. The area got about 10 inches, according to KNXV.

The Haas' front porch light was on, so they believe the couple was heading toward their house. They were 100 yards short, Mike Haas said.
They found the man lying on top of his wife, possibly in an attempt to keep her warm, according to the homeowners.

""It’s sadness,” he said. “You wish you could’ve helped. You could’ve saved a life perhaps. Maybe two lives.""
Diane Haas believes that if the couple had stayed in their car, someone driving along the road would have rescued them.

A preliminary investigation found no evidence of foul play, authorities said. The time of the couple's deaths has not been established. "
"Mother, couple arrested after infant sold for $2,000: Police",https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-couple-arrested-infant-sold-2000-police/story?id=67489712,"
Three people in Kentucky were arrested for allegedly buying and selling a months-old baby, police said.

The infant's mother, Maria Domingo-Perez, 31, sold her child to a couple she did not know for $2,000, according to a statement from the Bowling Green Police Department on Tuesday.

Police learned of the exchange after officials at Parker Bennett Curry Elementary School received information about that child was no longer in its home, Officer Ronnie Ward told ABC News in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Ward said that a staff member at the school had been keeping an eye on the family after concerns were raised about the welfare of her five children, including the baby that was allegedly sold.
A motive is unknown at this time.

Domingo-Perez did not have any relationship with the couple prior to selling her child to them, according to Ward.

When Domingo-Perez was confronted by police, she allegedly gave ""conflicting statements"" before telling police she did sell her infant to Pascual Jose Manuel, 45, and Catarina Felipe Jose, 37, authorities said.
All three were charged with selling/purchasing a child for adoption, which is a felony, according to police.
The elementary school declined to comment on the case and directed ABC News to police.

The child, who was born in October, was taken in by Social Services along with Domingo-Perez's four other children, according to police.

Domingo-Perez, Manuel and Jose are all being held at the Warren County Regional Jail on $10,000 cash bond, online records show. "
Federal background check and state gun laws together reduce teen gun carrying: Study,https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-background-check-state-gun-laws-reduce-teen/story?id=67437875,"
As the Supreme Court hears its first firearms case since 2010 this week, new research indicates there's one area in which strong gun laws have proved effective.

Adolescents in states that require universal background checks were less likely to report carrying a firearm than teenagers living in states that rely entirely on checks during gun sales at federally licensed gun dealers, a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics found.

In states with a universal background check law, like California and New York, background checks for gun sales are required -- even during private transactions, such as sales at gun shows or online, closing the so-called gun-show loophole.
To track the differences between states, researchers analyzed responses to the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey from nearly 180,000 students to between 1993 and 2017.

Roughly 5.8% of those students reported carrying a gun during the previous year, although since the survey only included students enrolled in school, that estimate is likely on the low side for adolescents who carry guns overall.

Notably, 83% of the students who reported carrying a gun were from states that did not have universal background checks in place. Only 17% were from states with a universal background check law.

Students who said they were threatened or injured by a weapon on school property were four times more likely to carry a gun than their peers who hadn't had those experiences.
As for why more high school students are carrying guns in states without universal background checks, stricter states might sell fewer guns to ineligible buyers -- such as underage people -- ultimately reducing adolescents' access to guns, Teresa Bell, coauthor of the new study, hypothesized.

It's also possible that there are latent differences between states, explained Bell, an assistant professor of surgery at Indiana University School of Medicine. For example, students' attitudes about carrying guns, and potentially their future behavior, might change when background check laws are passed in the wake of a high-profile school shooting.
The researchers set out to investigate whether the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS -- which vets prospective gun buyers for disqualifying criteria, such as prior felony convictions, and which went online in 1998 -- would stop teens from carrying guns.

Their finding was that NICS alone didn't drive down teen gun carrying -- but states' independent gun laws didn't prove effective until NICS was in place.

Ultimately, NICS combined with state universal background checks reduced adolescent gun carrying by 25%, the researchers found.

""This is consistent with a growing body of literature that it is a complex of regulations that are needed to reduce guns and their consequences,"" said Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and dean at the Boston University School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.
""Showing that NICS and UBC together make the biggest difference adds further evidence that states like [Massachusetts], for example, have been able to achieve lower firearm mortality rates by having in place multiple policies that act together to reduce casual gun carrying and its consequences,"" Galea said.

While state and federal background checks seem to have a trickle-down effect for teenagers, those laws are ultimately aimed at adults, meaning there may be more targeted ways to reduce teen gun carrying.

Educating gun owners who care for teenagers about safe storage practices is a prime area to explore for future interventions, according to Bell. Another is helping kids feel safe at school.

""Providing support to students who are threatened or injured at school could have large impacts on reducing teen gun-carrying,"" she said."
Twin brother charged in high school football star's fatal shooting,https://abcnews.go.com/US/twin-brother-charged-high-school-football-stars-fatal/story?id=67506643,"
A Philadelphia teenager has been charged in the fatal shooting of his twin brother, police said Wednesday.

Police charged 18-year-old Fayaadh Gillard with murder in connection with the death of his twin, Suhail Gillard, an all-star football player at Philadelphia's Mastery Charter School Lenfest Campus.

Officers responded to a call about a shooting on Sunday at around 5:30 p.m. and found Suhail suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. He was transported to Lankenau Medical Center by police and pronounced dead hours later.
Investigators have not revealed any details about the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but family members said they're confident that no foul play was involved.

""This was an accident. Fayaadh is an excellent and great kid just like his brother,"" their uncle, Hasan Ford, told ABC News on Wednesday as the family prepared for the young man's Thursday burial. ""They were our greatest pride and our greatest joy. They were the ones with the most potential of our lineage.""

He declined to discuss how the teens gained access to the firearm, but he said the brothers had ""never dealt with guns prior to this incident.""

Fayaadh has been charged with murder, possession of an instrument of crime, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing justice, according to police.
John Davidson, assistant principal and head football coach for Mastery Charter School Lenfest Campus, where the brothers were both seniors, said the loss had shaken the school community. He described Suhail as ""a scholar athlete"" who was fielding college offers from several schools.

""He was a hard worker -- on and off the field. He was one of the players that I would love to coach again,"" Davidson told ABC News Wednesday following a school-sponsored ceremony in the teen's honor. ""We all admired his work ethic, his commitment to the game and his strive to always be better.""

""As a school, we've rallied together to support one another as well as his family in this tragic time,"" he added.
Davidson said Suhail had attended the charter school since seventh grade and was a Philadelphia all-star and a three-time All-Public League player. He was also a member of the school's track team.

""Offensively, he was our go-to. He was what we built our offense around this year,"" the football coach said. ""He was a rock for us.""
The school hosted a balloon releasing ceremony for Suhail at Penn's Landing, the waterfront park where the school is scheduled to hold its senior graduation later this year. The school is also planning to present the teen's mother with a trophy and jersey in the near future, according to Davidson.

""He's been in our school since the seventh grade and his mom has been a part of our fabric since he's been here. We're a very small school with a strong family atmosphere,"" Davidson said. ""We're trying to heal, but it's a continuing process and it's going to go on for some time.""

Classmates remembered the slain teen with a memorial near the school's entrance featuring his football jersey number, flowers, and numerous photos of him and his friends. "
New owner of genealogy website GEDmatch vows to protect users from search warrants,https://abcnews.go.com/US/owner-genealogy-website-gedmatch-vows-protect-users-search/story?id=67655654,"
The new owners of GEDmatch, a third-party genealogy site that's helped investigators crack cases using DNA, have vowed to protect users' privacy by fighting against police search warrants.

Verogen, Inc., the California-based forensic genomics company that recently bought GEDmatch, announced this week that it would ensure ongoing privacy protections remain in place.
In May, GEDmatch announced a change to its policy that would require participants to upload their personal DNA to the database and manually ""opt in"" if they wanted law enforcement to have access to their information. Before, users were opted in automatically.
The terms of service will not change, with respect to the use, purposes and processing of user data, Verogen CEO Brett Williams said in a statement.

The database currently has more than 1.3 million customer profiles, according to Verogen.

""We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting users' privacy and will fight any future attempts to access data of those who have not opted in,"" Williams said.
Up to 70 violent crimes have been solved as a result of genealogy searches, according to the company. GEDmatch was the tool California authorities used to identify and catch the suspected Golden State Killer.
The technology works by taking DNA submitted by suspects' family members and creating a much larger family tree than those built using law enforcement databases, such as the Combined DNA Index System, aka CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, genealogy expert CeCe Moore told ABC News earlier this year.
Other direct-to-consumer DNA companies, including AncestryDNA and 23AndMe, do not allow their DNA samples to be searched by authorities, Moore said.

"Richard Jewell, hero-turned-suspect in 1996 Olympics bombing, was 'torn,' mother says",https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-richard-jewell-hero-turned-suspect-1996-olympics/story?id=67694901,"
The world first came to know Richard Jewell during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The former security guard was working at Centennial Olympic Park when a pipe bomb exploded. His quick thinking saved countless lives and he was hailed as a hero -- until he wasn’t.

Shortly after the bomb blast, which resulted in two deaths and over 100 people injured, Jewell was named a suspect, and for weeks, his life was at the center of a media firestorm.

""I think everybody then started focusing on Richard Jewell and turning his life inside out, and making their life a living hell, instead of running around and  trying to see whether or not there’s other people that could’ve done this,"" G. Watson Bryant, Jewell’s longtime friend and attorney, told ABC News.
Twenty-three years later, the story of Jewell, who died in 2007, will be depicted in the eponymous film directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Paul Walter Hauser as Jewell and Kathy Bates as his mother, Bobi Jewell.
Richard Jewell was working as a security guard at Centennial Park on the evening of July 27, 1996. On that night, there was a Jack Mack and the Heart Attack concert and ""tens of thousands"" of people were in attendance, according to Tom Davis, a retired police officer who was stationed at the park with Jewell.
Thirty minutes before the bomb went off, a man called 911 warning of a bomb in the park and saying that it would detonate in 30 minutes. It released shrapnel everywhere once it detonated.

Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET

""I remember the heat,"" Davis said. ""I remember the smell of gunpowder. I remember seeing things falling from the sky as I started to get my wits about me. … It didn’t knock the wind out of me but it was like everything was in slow motion. It put me in a state of confusion for a few seconds because I just didn’t know what happened.""

There could’ve been scores more concertgoers killed or injured. But Jewell had spotted the bag holding the bomb underneath a bench shortly before it went off. In that critical moment, which is also depicted in the film, Jewell cautioned his colleagues about getting near the bag and instead called it in as a suspicious package.

""I think that lives were saved because of actions that we all took that night of trying to get that perimeter established as quickly as we possibly could,"" Davis said.
Richard Jewell’s quick thinking thrust him into the international spotlight. He appeared on TV news for interviews and journalists were staking out at his home.

""I couldn’t believe it. I mean, he was just Richard to me. But then when there are 97,000 photographers out front, and a few more phones ringing...you know, it’s surreal,"" Bobi Jewell told ABC News.

Within days, however, the public’s view of Richard Jewell flipped once Jewell’s hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ran a headline reading, ""FBI suspects 'hero' guard may have planted bomb.""

""A great reporter named Kathy Scruggs managed to get this incredible scoop, which means somebody in law enforcement had leaked it,"" said Kent Alexander, the U.S. attorney assigned to investigate the bombing and author of a book on the incident titled ""The Suspect.""

""When this story broke, it was like nothing anybody in law enforcement had ever seen, because it was...everywhere,"" he continued.
Reporters who were once seeking comment from the Jewells about his heroism were now asking about the allegations that he’d planted the bomb. It didn’t help when he left his home escorted by two FBI agents.

""He was worn, torn and tattered. He really was,"" said Bobi Jewell of her son’s reaction to the turn of events.

The FBI agents had told Richard Jewell that he was going to their Atlanta headquarters to help create a police training video. However, when he arrived, they began questioning him about the bombing.

In never-before-released video from his interrogation, an FBI agent can be seen telling Richard Jewell: ""The reason you’re here today is we’re interviewing all the individuals that were at Centennial Park when the bomb went off.""
""Richard Jewell, he’s mic’d up, he’s got his Olympics hat on, he’s sitting in the corner with the two agents facing him -- the cameraman in the back -- and they start going through lots of questions,"" said Alexander.

It wasn’t until the FBI agents handed Richard Jewell a form with his Miranda Rights that his disposition changed, and he wondered out loud if he should have an attorney present.
""I don’t know if I should call an attorney now or not because I don’t know if this video is for -- after what the news people [said] -- I don’t know if I’m being investigated for this or if this is what you told me it’s for,"" Richard Jewell said in the interrogation tape.

Richard Jewell called Bryant and asked Bryant to represent him. Of that moment in the interrogation room, Bryant said, ""I think I told him to shut the hell up and get his fat ass out of there.""

Bryant, who is portrayed by Sam Rockwell in the film, became a fierce defender of Richard Jewell. He said he believed Richard Jewell didn’t commit the bombing because he knew him to be a good person.
""I knew him to be a good, decent guy,"" Bryant said. ""If he had $2, he’d spend $4 buying you presents. He’d give you the shirt off his back.""

As part of their investigation into Richard Jewell, the FBI searched the home he lived in with his mother and left with some of her possessions, including VHS tapes and tupperware.

""I couldn’t believe it. They had taken -- and I love to say this, because I love tupperware -- they had my flour, my sugar, my macaroni, anything that I had in tupperware,"" Bobi Jewell said.

Bobi Jewell ultimately chose to speak publicly in defense of her son. During a press conference, she made an emotional plea to then-President Bill Clinton to clear his name if the FBI didn’t intend to charge him with anything.

""She was uncomfortable,"" Bates said of the mother she portrays on screen. ""She was in a room full of  people that had maligned her  son. … I think that tension of really trying to hold on to emotion, really trying to keep it in, and then not being able to at the end.""

Bates has earned  praise for her performance in ""Richard Jewell,"" but the film itself stirred up controversy for the way it portrays Scruggs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter played by Olivia Wilde. In the film, Scruggs’ character trades sex for the scoop that placed Richard Jewell as a suspect.
A letter to Clint Eastwood and his team sent by lawyers representing the Atlanta newspaper said that the film ""falsely portrays the AJC and its personnel as extraordinarily reckless, using unprofessional and highly inappropriate reporting methods. … Such a portrayal makes it appear that the AJC sexually exploited its staff and/or that it facilitated or condoned offering sexual gratification to sources in exchange for stories. That is entirely false and malicious, and it is extremely defamatory and damaging.""
Both Eastwood and Hauser pushed back on these assertions.

""I can understand why everybody would get defensive on this  thing, but the plain facts are they were the first ones to notify the public that this was going on,"" Eastwood told ABC News. ""But I don’t hold it against them. I read their paper. It seems fine. I assume that they just got wrapped up in the euphoria, like everybody else.""
""I know that working in Hollywood, Hollywood takes artistic liberties in their storytelling to tell a narrative,"" Hauser added. ""So, while I appreciate their opinions, if they think it’s going to extinguish what we’re trying to do with the Jewell family, they would be incorrect.""

On Thursday, Olivia Wilde tweeted that she doesn't believe Scruggs ""traded sex for tips,"" but rather, that her character was in a ""pre-existing romantic relationship"" with the ""FBI agent who leaked false information to her.""The perspective of the fictional dramatization of the story, as I understood it, was that Kathy, and the FBI agent who leaked false information to her, were in a pre-existing romantic relationship, not a transactional exchange of sex for information.— olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) December 12, 2019 The perspective of the fictional dramatization of the story, as I understood it, was that Kathy, and the FBI agent who leaked false information to her, were in a pre-existing romantic relationship, not a transactional exchange of sex for information.
Richard Jewell’s 88 days of scrutiny and investigation ended on Oct. 26, 1996, when authorities cleared his name as a suspect. Seven years later, the actual bomber, Eric Rudolph, was arrested. Rudolph, it turns out, was wanted for a series of bombings across the country.

Bobi Jewell said the film will ""finally"" vindicate her son in history, although she wishes it had happened 23 years ago.
""You’re making a film. You hope that you can make it so it has an entertainment value and a value of information out there,"" Eastwood said. ""But then, all of a sudden, here’s somebody who’s living now, [who] has lived through the whole thing. And she feels there’s some vindication in the film. That’s very humbling.""

Richard Jewell was 44 years old when he died in 2007 of a heart attack. Bobi Jewell said she thinks the intense scrutiny and misjudgment her son endured took a toll on his life.

""I think it killed him,"" Bobi Jewell said, ""I really do.""

Deli killings may be domestic terrorism: Officials,https://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-hates-suspects-religious-literature-eyed-motive-jersey/story?id=67683625,"
A pair of armed suspects, one wielding an AR-15 style rifle, who killed three people at a Jewish supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey, moments after gunning down a police detective in a cemetery appear to have been motivated by ""both anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement"" sentiments, officials said on Thursday.

The suspects, David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, were killed in an hourslong shootout with police on Tuesday but left a trail of potential evidence investigators are combing through to determine why they allegedly killed Jersey City police Det. Joseph Seals and targeted the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket, officials said.
""Based on what we have collected so far, including based on recent witness interviews, we believe that the suspects held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people as well as a hatred of law enforcement,"" New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said at a news conference.

Grewal said killings are now being investigated as ""potential acts of domestic terrorism fueled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs.""

Craig Carpenito, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation will take the lead in the probe.
""The motivation clearly appears to be a bias towards both the Jewish community and law enforcement,"" Carpenito said. ""This is going to be investigated going forward ... as a domestic terrorism event.""

The announcement came after law enforcement sources told ABC News that investigators had found religious writings by the suspects expressing hate.

In a stolen U-Haul van, the suspects parked in front of the kosher market just seconds before launching a rifle attack. Investigators found a pipe bomb and religious writings, including a handwritten note reading, ""I do this because my creator makes me do this and I hate who he hates,"" multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Grewal said five firearms were found at the scene, one an AR-15 style rifle that security video showed Anderson firing as he entered the supermarket around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday.
""We also recovered a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which we believe Francine Graham was carrying as she entered the supermarket,"" Grewal said.

Investigators also recovered from inside the store two other guns the suspects were armed with -- a 9mm Ruger semiautomatic handgun and a 9mm Glock 17, he said.

Inside the U-Haul van the suspects were driving, investigators also found a .22-caliber Ruger Mark IV handgun equipped with a homemade silencer and a homemade device to catch shell casings, Grewal said.

He said investigators recovered ""several hundred shell casings"" at the scene which investigators are processing to determine how many were fired by the suspects and how many were fired by the police.
Grewal said that based on two of the guns' serial numbers, the Mossberg shotgun and the .22-caliber Ruger, were legally purchased in 2018 by Graham at different gun shops in Ohio.

""At this point, our evidence indicates that the shooters were aiming their fire at law enforcement officers only and not at others on the street,"" Grewal said.

He said the investigation, so far, has found no accomplices involved. He also said investigators have learned that Anderson and Graham expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, a group that espouses hatred toward Jews and is known for anti-government and anti-police sentiments.

""We have not definitively established any formal links to that organization or to any other group. Based on the available evidence we believe that the two shooters were acting on their own,"" Grewal said.

Meanwhile, thousands of members of the Jewish Orthodox communities in Jersey City and Brooklyn, New York, gathered at cemeteries Wednesday night to mourn and bury two of the victims, 33-year-old Mindy Ferencz, the wife of the kosher supermarket owner and mother of five, and 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch, a Yeshiva student.
Deutsch's father, Abe Deutsch, is a member of the United Jewish Organization's board of directors, said Rabbi David Niederman, president of the organization.

“A few hundred bullets went into the body of a 24-year-old child ... how can we as a community, as people, bear that?” Niederman said of Moshe Deutsch, during a news conference Wednesday at City Hall in New York City.

The third victim killed at the supermarket was identified by authorities as Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, who worked at the store. Funeral arrangements for Rodriguez are pending.

A funeral for Det. Seals, 39, a married father of five, is scheduled to be held next Tuesday.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the Jersey City incident is a wakeup call.

""The murder of innocent civilians because of their religious beliefs, and the murder of a police officer for the simple reason that he was a police officer, must be the wakeup call to those who fail to see or acknowledge the rising tide of hate here in New Jersey, and around the nation,”  Murphy said in a statement. “This is our signal to come together as the broad New Jersey family we are and recommit to the elimination of hate in all its forms.""

The terrifying episode began to unfold about 12:38 p.m. on Tuesday when the Jersey City Police Department received a 911 call from an individual who discovered Seals' body in the Bayview Cemetery, about a mile from the kosher market, Grewal said on Wednesday.
He said investigators believe Seals was shot to death when he confronted the suspects in Bayview cemetery. He said Anderson and Graham were prime suspects in the murder this past weekend of an Uber driver officials identified as Michael Rumberger.

Rumberger's body was found in the trunk of a Lincoln Town car around 10 p.m. Saturday, sources told ABC News.

Seals apparently had gone to the cemetery alone to meet the suspects and one of them may have been an informant he had worked with, possibly explaining why he felt comfortable meeting in the cemetery without backup or radioing in about the rendezvous, the sources said.
Seals, a plainclothes undercover detective, had been investigating the homicide, according to law enforcement sources.

After allegedly killing Seals in the cemetery, the suspects got into the stolen U-Haul van and drove to the kosher market, arriving about 12:43 p.m., Grewal said.

Security video, obtained by ABC News, shows the suspects parking directly across the street from the supermarket on Martin Luther King Drive, getting out of the vehicle holding rifles and calmly walking into the supermarket as passersby on the street scrambled for cover.
Grewal said four people, including the three slain victims, were inside the store when the suspects stormed through the front door. A lone survivor, who was shot and wounded, managed to escape, Grewal said.
Two foot-patrol officers were about a block from the deli and responded as soon as they heard the gunfire, Grewal said. They were both shot and wounded in a gunfight with the suspects that involved other Jersey City police officers, he said.

The gunbattle lasted until about 3:47 p.m. when a police armored vehicle broke through the entryway of the supermarket and police found the bodies of the suspects and the three victims inside.

In addition to the two other officers wounded in the shootout, a third was hurt by shrapnel, officials said. The officers were all treated at a hospital and released.

Boy left on side of road over sexuality: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/boys-relative-abandoned-side-road-thought-boy-gay/story?id=67470248,"
A Florida man has been charged with negligent child abuse after police said he dumped a boy, who he is related to, on the side of the road because he ""thinks that [the boy] is gay.""

Evenaud Julmeus, 30, of Haines City, was arrested Monday after local police found the boy alone in front of the Haines City Police Department, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by ABC News.

Julmeus allegedly told the boy before leaving him that ""the police will find you a new home.""
The two allegedly got into a verbal argument over the boy's sexuality when Julmeus found gay pornography on his phone.

Julmeus ""became very upset,"" according to the affidavit.
He told the boy to get in the car and pack a bag, which the boy did, the affidavit read.
Julmeus then allegedly took the boy to the Haines City Police Department, where he is said to have dropped him off on the side of the road in front of the building before heading back home.

Detectives noted that the boy ""did not have any food, water or money"" or a phone to contact anyone, according to the affidavit.

Police said in the affidavit that the boy's mother rushed to pick him up when Julmeus returned to their home without him and said the boy was at the police station.

A spokesman for Haines City police told ABC News that they would not detail the relationship between the boy because he is a minor and they want to protect his identity.
When authorities went to the home to find Julmeus, they found he was not there and left two other minors without adult supervision.

Julmeus is facing three counts of negligent child abuse. Calls to Julmeus were not returned and it was not immediately clear if he had yet obtained legal representation.

This teen hides books around town to bring reading and adventure to children,https://abcnews.go.com/US/teen-hides-books-iowa-town-bring-reading-adventure/story?id=67463965,"
When Sami Noteboom shared with her stepmother, Amanda, that she was looking to make a difference in her community, Amanda shared with the teenager a Facebook post she'd seen recently about a book-hiding program.

After quite a bit of effort, Sami, 17, of Sheldon, Iowa, started Sheldon Look 4 a Book.

The idea came about Sept. 1, when Amanda saw on social media a post about towns in other countries hiding books for children, to incorporate adventure and reading, particularly the East Yorkshire Look 4 a Book.
Sami, a senior at Sheldon High School, and Amanda thought the gesture was something that could be implemented in their own town.

Sami had been looking to take up a community service project for her 4-H club that also encouraged reading for the youth in their town. Though her busy high school schedule made finding time to read difficult these days, she and her siblings enjoyed the pastime as children, her stepmother said.
Amanda told ABC News on Tuesday that Sami is active in her local Western Workers 4-H club, but also O'Brien County Youth 4-H council. The council, she said, expected students to participate in community service. Sami had also applied for the National Honor Society, which takes into consideration leadership and service as well as grades.

""I thought this would be a perfect way for Sami to start her community engagement,"" Amanda told ABC News. ""Reading was hard for her at first, so for us to see the process get easier for her was a relief. If putting books in the hands of children makes reading easier for them .... then why not help them succeed.""

Amanda, a school teacher, was able to get books from her classroom. Meanwhile, Sami also applied for a grant at their church in order to buy more books.
Luckily, Sami won the grant and they were able to buy books and supplies. People also began to donate books.

""My stepmom really helped me with this and thought it would be great for our small town,"" she said. ""We hoped for it to take off.""

By the end of September, the two had begun hiding books all over their small Iowa town.

The books were bagged and included a little note. When children found the books, they also got a letter from Sami that told them that they could either read the book and then rehide it for someone else, or they could keep the book and then hide one of their own.
Families began posting pictures on the Sheldon Community Facebook page of the children finding the books.

""It’s fun to see the kids coming into class excited to tell me they found a book,"" Amanda told ABC News.
Marshall Cox, 4, found three books in downtown Sheldon and then in Ashton, Iowa. His father, Jed Cox, told ABC News how excited Marshall was to find the books.

""He gave one of the books to a friend to read and they hid it together after. The other books he bagged them and hid them again,"" Cox said.
""Some books [were found in] neighboring towns and a couple were even found in Texas,"" Sami told ABC News. ""I want it to spread across the U.S.""
Other communities have been so inspired by what Sami did that they created their own version of Sheldon Look 4 a book, Amanda said.
""There have been two high schools in our area that have started book finds since Sami started hers,"" Amanda told ABC News.

The two are hoping that program can continue even as Sami heads off to college next year. "
"Mass-shooting rehearsal videos lead to man's arrest, police say",https://abcnews.go.com/US/california-man-arrested-rehearsing-mass-shooting-plot-video/story?id=67571966,"
A California man has been arrested after residents reported that he'd been rehearsing a mass shooting plot in videos posted online, police said Friday.

Steve Homoki, 30, was arrested and charged with possession of an assault weapon, possession of a high-capacity magazine and child endangerment, according to the San Diego Police Department.

Police arrested Homoki in San Diego on Thursday, nearly four days after receiving ""a tip concerning very distressing YouTube videos threatening firearm violence linked to San Diego,"" according to a statement released on Friday.

The videos allegedly showed a man pointing assault weapons at several unassuming pedestrians from a hotel window in downtown San Diego. Officers with the San Diego Joint Terrorism Task Force launched an investigation and identified Homoki as the man in the videos.
""An Investigation was initiated by the JTTF that day and over the course of the next 48 hours, Steven Homoki was identified as the person responsible for the videos,"" the department said in a statement. ""A search warrant was obtained for his residence in Spring Valley, California.""

Police arrested Homoki on Thursday and recovered several firearms from his home. He allegedly has at least 14 firearms registered in California, according to San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV, which obtained a copy of a warrant for his arrest.
According to the warrant, Homoki allegedly booked a hotel room at the Sofia Hotel, located across the street from the San Diego courthouse, and used the space to practice aiming the weapon from the hotel room's window.

The YouTube videos, posted Sept. 17 and 18, appeared to be recorded using a body-worn camera. They showed a man displaying two assault-style rifles on a couch, along with a female mannequin head, a Department of Homeland Security license plate, an envelope and ammunition scattered on the room's floor.
The suspect was also seen loading and pointing the rifles at people walking outside, while repeating ""jams, boom."" He was also seen pulling the trigger while the firearm's chamber was empty, or ""dry firing.""

""One down, more to go,"" he said at one point, according to the court documents.

The San Diego Police Department credited community members for reporting the videos and thanked them for speaking up about ""an immediate threat to San Diegans.""
""This arrest is an example of a community member coming forward with information that posed an immediate threat to San Diegans,"" the department said in a statement. ""The San Diego Police Department would like to thank the community for their shared efforts to keep everyone safe.""

San Diego FBI Special Agent In Charge Scott Brunner called the arrest ""an extraordinary accomplishment.""

""The extraordinarily swift investigative efforts put forth by the dedicated Agents and Officers of the San Diego JTTF quickly identified, located and arrested Mr. Homoki, preventing further incident,"" Brunner said in a statement Friday. ""Just three days ago Mr. Homoki was an unknown poster of disturbing videos and is now behind bars, his threats neutralized. This investigation is a truly extraordinary accomplishment.""

Homoki was being held on $20,000 bail and is scheduled for arraignment on Monday afternoon. It's unclear if he has obtained an attorney.

Trump asks Supreme Court to shield banking records,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-asks-supreme-court-shield-banking-records-now-67552696,"
The Supreme Court on Friday temporarily shielded the bank records of President Donald Trump and three of his children from House Democrats.
In an order signed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the House cannot enforce subpoenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One at least until Dec. 13.
The justices are scheduled to discuss at least one and maybe two other similar cases at their private conference that day. One concerns a subpoena from the House for Trump's financial records and the other is a demand from the Manhattan district attorney for his tax returns.
The court already has blocked the House from getting the financial records while it considers what to do with the cases. The district attorney has agreed to hold off enforcing his subpoena until the justices act. A decision on whether to hear the cases could come by mid-December.
Trial judges and appellate panels in all three cases have ruled that the records held by the banks and Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, must be turned over.
The subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One also seek documents pertaining to three Trump children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump; the Trump Organization; and other Trump business holdings.
Without a Supreme Court order, the banks would have had to begin turning over records to House committees next week.

Army major jailed on federal child porn charge,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/army-major-georgia-jailed-federal-child-porn-charge-67607528,"
An Army officer who held a top-secret security clearance shared nude photos of a teenage girl online and discussed plans to drug the girl and have sex with her, according to federal court records unsealed Monday.
Army Maj. Jason Musgrove was arrested and charged with distributing child pornography after an FBI agent monitoring online groups devoted to child pornography and discussions of child sex traced the photos to a computer in Musgrove's home in Georgia, said documents filed in U.S. District Court.
Court records said Musgrove is assigned to the Army Cyber Command at Fort Gordon in Augusta, where he works as an integrated threats operations officer with a top-secret security clearance.
Maj. Kip Patterson, a Cyber Command spokesman, said the Army is cooperating with civilian authorities in their investigation. He said commanders had suspended Musgrove's security clearance and taken other “standard Army administrative actions.”
""Obviously the chain of command is very concerned and we’re looking at what actions should be taken,” Patterson said.
Musgrove was being held Monday at the Lincoln County jail. Court records did not list whether he has an attorney who could comment on his behalf .
In an affidavit filed with the court, FBI agent Tripp Godbee said another agent working undercover  was monitoring groups on the mobile app Kik when a man logged in last Wednesday and Thursday and began sharing nude photos of a teenage girl.
The agent began swapping online messages with the man, who identified himself as being “employed as an Officer for the Army,” the affidavit said. 
The user sharing the photos then discussed his plans to have sex with the girl after drugging her, according to the affidavit.
“I want to be prepared with the proper ingredients for a good night cocktail!"" the man said, according to the affidavit. ""Right now I'm looking at mixing some cherry NyQuil into a Dr. Pepper.”
That prompted the FBI  to obtain the user's account information from Kik. The affidavit said the information included a computer IP address that agents traced to Musgrove's home near Augusta.
A federal magistrate judge ordered that Musgrove remain in custody of U.S. marshals, who jailed him in Lincoln County.

"Man who played Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street dies at 85",https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-played-big-bird-oscar-grouch-sesame-street/story?id=67580263,"
The longtime puppeteer behind beloved Sesame Street characters Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, Caroll Spinney, has died at age 85, the Sesame Street Workshop announced in a statement.

Spinney spent five decades with Sesame Street, working with legendary puppeteer Jim Henson at the start of his career.
""Caroll Spinney gave something truly special to the world. With deepest admiration, Sesame Workshop is proud to carry his memory – and his beloved characters – into the future,"" the workshop announced in a statement. ""Our hearts go out to Caroll’s beloved wife, Debra, and all of his children and grandchildren.""

While Spinney himself may not have had the widespread recognition of his characters, his portrayal of the 8-foot yellow bird and trash can-dwelling Oscar, skyrocketed both characters to global fame. Big Bird has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his likeness on a U.S. postage stamp and was named a ""Living Legend"" in 2000 by the Library of Congress.
""Those of us privileged to work alongside him and call him friend saw first-hand that he cared so deeply about what these characters represented and how they could truly create change,"" the Jim Henson Company said in a statement.



In a 2015 interview on the website Reddit, Spinney recalled one of his most meaningful interactions with a child. He said he had received a letter asking him to call a 5-year-old boy named Joey who was ""so ill, the little boy knew he was dying,"" Spinney said in the interview.
""He said the only thing that cheered him at all in his fading state was to see Big Bird on television,"" Spinney said of the man who had written to him.

When he called and spoke to the child as Big Bird, their conversation lasted for about ten minutes.

""He said, 'Thank you for calling me, Big Bird. You're my friend. You make me happy,'"" Spinney recalled. The child died months after the call.

""Caroll Spinney’s contributions to Sesame Street are countless. He not only gave us Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, he gave so much of himself as well. We at Sesame Workshop mourn his passing and feel an immense gratitude for all he has given to Sesame Street and to children around the world,"" said Sesame Street co-founder Joan Ganz Cooney in a statement.
Spinney, who retired from Sesame Street in 2018, had been living with Dystonia -- a chronic disorder that makes muscles contract abnormally -- for some time and died at his home in Connecticut. He leaves behind his wife Debra, children and grandchildren.

Tesla on Autopilot slams into police cruiser; driver says he was checking on dog,https://abcnews.go.com/US/tesla-autopilot-slams-police-cruiser-driver-claims-checking/story?id=67570199,"
A Tesla on Autopilot slammed into two vehicles on Saturday, one of which was a Connecticut State Police cruiser, officials said.

The driver of the Tesla told police that he put the car on Autopilot because he was checking on his dog in the backseat, according to a statement from Connecticut State Police.

The incident happened in the early morning hours Saturday on Interstate 95 in Norwalk.
Police had been called to the highway because of a disabled vehicle that was occupying a lane, authorities said.

As troopers were waiting for a tow truck for that car, the Tesla, described as a 2018 Model 3, was traveling northbound and struck the rear of the cruiser before continuing in the same direction and hitting the disabled vehicle, according to authorities.
The car was finally stopped several hundred feet ahead by another trooper.

The driver, who was not identified, was issued a misdemeanor summons for reckless driving and reckless endangerment, police said.
No one was seriously injured in the incident.

State police cited the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and said that while certain vehicles have some automated capabilities, there are none yet that are fully automated or self-driving.
""Regardless of your vehicles capabilities, when operating a vehicle your full attention is required at all times to ensure safe driving,"" state police said.

Tesla has issued similar statements in the wake of past Autopilot accidents, saying drivers must keep their hands on the wheel at all times.

A California mother has been charged with felony child endangerment and arson after firefighters discovered her 3-year-old son trapped inside their burning home, which police say she set aflame.

Maricela Magana Ruiz, 47, allegedly left her son alone in a bedroom after putting a plastic bag over his head and tying his hands, according to a press release from the Santa Paula Police Department.

Firefighters discovered the little boy as they were trying to put out the fire on Sunday in the Santa Paula home, authorities said.
Ruiz was also found tied to a bed in the home, according to police.
Both were discovered after she called 911 to report the fire at 6:10 p.m. on Sunday. The little boy was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and has since been released to child protective services, authorities said.

Detective Allen Macias told ABC News on Tuesday that he did not know ""what was going through her mind at the time.""
He said that while a concrete motive hasn't been established, Ruiz was going through a ""pretty nasty custody battle"" with the boy's father.

It was not clear how long before she set the house aflame that she called 911, but when firefighters arrived ""all three stories [of the home] were filled with black smoke,"" Macias said.

Ruiz was initially charged with only felony child endangerment, but on Monday night investigators found evidence to charge her with arson as well.

She was booked into the Ventura County Jail. Her bail was initially set at $50,000 for felony child endangerment, but is now at $500,000.

Proposed bill would make learning cursive a requirement for all students,https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-bill-require-students-learn-cursive-end-3rd/story?id=67494909,"
Students in New Jersey may be required to learn how to read and write cursive by the end of the third grade.

A new bill, which was introduced last month, would require school curriculum to include activities and instructions that ""help students become proficient"" in the handwriting skill, a portion of the bill reads.

Assemblywoman Angela McKnight, who introduced the bill, said Tuesday that schools are ""doing our children a disservice by not teaching them a vital skill they will need for the rest of their lives.""
She worried that young students won't know how to sign a check or read a scripted font as the world becomes ""increasingly dependent on technology,"" according to her statement.
The bill also notes research which suggests that knowing cursive improves students' development of cognitive, motor and literacy skills, and helps students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia.
Cursive was dropped as a requirement in Common Core standards in 2010, according to a press release from the state's Assembly Democrats.

Nearly two dozen states have made similar efforts, according to New Jersey Assembly Democrats, including Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.

The legislation would apply to the first full school year that follows the bill's enactment date. The bill is currently on its way for review in the Assembly Education Committee. "
Sneaker Con is Comic Con for booming 'sneakerhead' culture,https://abcnews.go.com/US/sneaker-con-comic-con-booming-sneakerhead-culture/story?id=67353149,"
Sneaker Con, arguably the world’s largest and most popular sneaker convention show, was held this year at the Anaheim Convention Center where sneaker fanatics convened to buy, sell and trade the latest and rarest kicks from Air Jordans to Yeezys.

""This is the biggest event we’ve done in Southern California with more than 12,000 attendees and vendors,” Sneaker Con co-founder Yu-Ming Wu told ABC News. “2019 will be Sneaker Con’s biggest year to date with more than 125,000 attendees and vendors total.”
Since its inaugural launch in New York City in 2009, Sneaker Con has held events in over 40 cities worldwide, attended by over 1 million so-called ""sneakerheads"" according to a spokesperson for Sneaker Con.

""Our dream was to really gather all the sneakerheads from around the area and globe,"" said Wu. ""It’s like a Comic Con ... like-minded people who love sneakers and treat sneakers as an art form and fashion accessory.""

Market research reveals the world has a lot of sneakerheads. According to research website Statista, ""in 2017, the total global sneakers market was valued at approximately 62.5 billion U.S. dollars and was forecast to reach a value of 97.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.""

Sneaker Cons were held  in Florida, Washington D.C., Texas, Canada and Australia this year. The last show of the year will be in China.

Sneaker Con is also a vast online community. The brand has 61k followers on Twitter and a whopping 3.3 million on Instagram.

A collaboration with agency and management company IMG, has helped Sneaker Con expand its global presence and to ""enhance the event experience with new collaborations, talent, programming and brands,"" said Tim Pernetti, executive vice president, IMG Media and Events, in an interview with WWD.

Also helping to increase Sneaker Con's popularity is a technology called ""LEGIT"" that the event's organizers offer to authenticate sneakers on-site for free so that that buyers know they are purchasing authentic brands and not knock-offs.
Aleali May, who has designed Air Jordans for both men and women, believes Sneaker Con has allowed women to collaborate on creating sneakers that women like.

“Sneakers represent so much from a person’s style to what they been through and where they are going,” May said. “The great part about Sneaker Con is that it's taking all these people and seeing that we all have something in common and that starts with our sneakers.”
""I’ve honestly seen more women at sneaker conventions or things that deal with the context of sneakers way more than ever,"" she explained. ""I feel that it also represents what the space is looking like outside of Sneaker Con.""

Sneaker influencer and vendor, Jaysee Lopez, has seen Sneaker Con drastically grow the last five years he’s attended with more brands getting involved in the action.

""I’ve never been a part of anything else that I’ve cared for that’s like this,"" Lopez said. ""It’s really awesome to see the growth and how it’s being embraced by everyone.""

""When you come to Sneaker Con, other than trading shoes and buying shoes, it's really about having that community atmosphere here,” Wu said. ""It’s a community in real life like any other community, this is for people who love sneakers.""

Twin brother charged in HS football star's death,https://abcnews.go.com/US/twin-brother-charged-high-school-football-stars-fatal/story?id=67506643,"
A Philadelphia teenager has been charged in the fatal shooting of his twin brother, police said Wednesday.

Police charged 18-year-old Fayaadh Gillard with murder in connection with the death of his twin, Suhail Gillard, an all-star football player at Philadelphia's Mastery Charter School Lenfest Campus.

Officers responded to a call about a shooting on Sunday at around 5:30 p.m. and found Suhail suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. He was transported to Lankenau Medical Center by police and pronounced dead hours later.
Investigators have not revealed any details about the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but family members said they're confident that no foul play was involved.

""This was an accident. Fayaadh is an excellent and great kid just like his brother,"" their uncle, Hasan Ford, told ABC News on Wednesday as the family prepared for the young man's Thursday burial. ""They were our greatest pride and our greatest joy. They were the ones with the most potential of our lineage.""

He declined to discuss how the teens gained access to the firearm, but he said the brothers had ""never dealt with guns prior to this incident.""

Fayaadh has been charged with murder, possession of an instrument of crime, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing justice, according to police.
John Davidson, assistant principal and head football coach for Mastery Charter School Lenfest Campus, where the brothers were both seniors, said the loss had shaken the school community. He described Suhail as ""a scholar athlete"" who was fielding college offers from several schools.

""He was a hard worker -- on and off the field. He was one of the players that I would love to coach again,"" Davidson told ABC News Wednesday following a school-sponsored ceremony in the teen's honor. ""We all admired his work ethic, his commitment to the game and his strive to always be better.""

""As a school, we've rallied together to support one another as well as his family in this tragic time,"" he added.
Davidson said Suhail had attended the charter school since seventh grade and was a Philadelphia all-star and a three-time All-Public League player. He was also a member of the school's track team.

""Offensively, he was our go-to. He was what we built our offense around this year,"" the football coach said. ""He was a rock for us.""
The school hosted a balloon releasing ceremony for Suhail at Penn's Landing, the waterfront park where the school is scheduled to hold its senior graduation later this year. The school is also planning to present the teen's mother with a trophy and jersey in the near future, according to Davidson.

""He's been in our school since the seventh grade and his mom has been a part of our fabric since he's been here. We're a very small school with a strong family atmosphere,"" Davidson said. ""We're trying to heal, but it's a continuing process and it's going to go on for some time.""

Classmates remembered the slain teen with a memorial near the school's entrance featuring his football jersey number, flowers, and numerous photos of him and his friends. "
"String of Ring camera hacks see homeowners subjected to racial abuse, ransom demands",https://abcnews.go.com/US/ring-security-camera-hacks-homeowners-subjected-racial-abuse/story?id=67679790,"
Multiple U.S. families have reported incidents of Ring camera systems being hacked in recent days, raising questions as to whether the systems are allowing hackers access to people's homes, without ever having to set foot inside.

Owners of Ring security cameras in Mississippi, Georgia, Florida and Texas have reported incidents where hackers tormented families with racial slurs, encouraged children into destructive behavior and demanded a ransom in Bitcoin.

""I can't even put into words how violated I feel. It really is like my worst nightmare,"" Mississippi mom Ashley Lemay told ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

Lemay installed a Ring camera in her daughters' room to keep an eye on them while she worked overnight shifts as a nurse.
Only four days after installing it, her 8-year-old daughter, Alyssa, heard music and a banging noise coming from the room where the camera was installed.

Alyssa says that when she began looking for the source of the noise, she heard a voice saying, ""I'm Santa Claus, don't you want to be my best friend?""

Lemay says the voice taunted Alyssa and encouraged her to mess up her room and break her TV before her dad came into the room and shut the camera off.

""I was even scared of my room for a few days. I'm still a little bit scared of it,"" Alyssa told ""GMA.""
In response to the incidents, Ring said in a statement, ""Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously. While we are still investigating this issue and are taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation, we are able to confirm this incident is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring's security.""

""Due to the fact that customers often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions, bad actors often re-use credentials stolen or leaked from one service on other services,"" Ring continued. ""As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords.""
In Georgia, a couple who asked not to be identified say they were horrified to hear the voice of a hacker in their bedroom via a camera they had installed to watch their puppy while they were at work.

""I see the blue light come on, and so I'm texting my boyfriend saying, you know, 'Why are you watching? We're laying down. We're about to go to sleep.' He's like, 'What are you talking about?'"" the woman told ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta.

Seconds later, she said she heard someone clapping and saying, ""I can see you in the bed! ... Come on! Wake the f--- up!""

""I was terrified. I mean, I literally could not move my body,"" said the woman, who reported the incident to Ring.
For the Brown family of Cape Coral, Florida, the hack of their Ring camera brought racist abuse into their home.

Video from the camera taken Sunday night shows a home alarm being triggered, followed by a voice spewing racial abuse through the camera.

""Is your kid a baboon, like the monkey?"" said the hacker. The abuse continued for three minutes, until the family removed the batteries from the camera.

Disturbingly, the family said their 15-year-old son did not appear on the camera during the incident, leading the family to believe the hacker had been observing them for longer than just that night, according to Naples ABC affiliate WZVN.
In Grand Prairie, Texas, a couple was rudely awakened on Monday when a hacker took over their camera system and demanded payment.

""I was asleep and our Ring alarm was going off like an intruder had entered our home,"" Tania Amador told ABC affiliate WFAA. ""Then we heard a voice coming from our camera.""

In video captured by the camera of the incident, a voice can be heard laughing and then saying, ""Ring support! Ring support!""
It continues, saying, ""We would like to notify you that your account has been terminated by a hacker.""

It then says, ""Pay this 50 bitcoin ransom or you will get terminated yourself,"" before the hacker accessed Amador's doorbell camera, saying, ""I'm outside your front door.""

""Very scary to hear a threat shouted over the camera for a ransom,"" Amador told WFAA. ""The fact that the person was watching and we don't know for how long is even scarier.""

Police use drone to nab burglary suspect,https://abcnews.go.com/US/chopper-problem-texas-police-drone-nab-burglary-suspect/story?id=67538438,"
It used to be that police departments needed to have a helicopter to identify and locate fleeing suspects from the air.

But not anymore. The advent of drone technology is putting that capability into the hands of even small law enforcement agencies.
""It took a helicopter to chase bad guys in the past, and it was very expensive to do that -- something that an agency our size could never possibly afford,"" Lt. Russell Brown of the Bellaire Police Department in Texas told Houston ABC station KTRK.

Now Bellaire police have three drones at their disposal, and officers say they're helping save lives. When police in the nearby town of West University were trying to locate a fleeing burglary suspect, the call went out to Officer Aaron Lysack, one of four licensed drone pilots with the Bellaire Police.

Lysack, who was patrolling in his police cruiser, put his drone in the air sent it in search of the suspect.
""That drone was able to locate the suspect before the officers could, and basically lead officers to the suspect,"" Brown told KTRK.

The drone located the suspect running through a backyard, and it recorded him as he tried to get rid of a backpack.
When officers recovered it, authorities say the backpack was filled with the stolen items -- as well as a gun.

""The drone was able to see that, document that on film, and have that video ready for court if needed,"" Brown said.

For Lysack, drone technology represents a giant leap forward for law enforcement.
""It goes about 50 miles an hour. It's got a range of about three miles, as long as we can see it visually. It can go up to 400 feet high,"" said Lysack. ""The thermal camera on it can see a human walking down the street or even a warm vehicle that was recently parked. The zoom goes up to 30 times optical and 180 times digital.""

""I think this is a big game changer,"" he said.

"Probation for cop in $360,000 Social Security scam",https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-cop-probation-360000-theft-dead-moms-social/story?id=67475737,"
A former Chicago police commander who pleaded guilty to stealing more than $360,000 in Social Security payments intended for his dead mother managed to avoid jail time at sentencing on Tuesday.

Kenneth Johnson, a 32-year veteran of the force who led the Englewood patrol district his last two years on the force, was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to serve six months of community confinement after pleading guilty to theft of government funds earlier this year.

Federal prosecutors had requested that he be sentenced to 18 to 24 months in prison.

The sentencing came just a day after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired the city's police superintendent over what she referred to as ""ethical lapses"" and “flawed decision-making.”

Johnson, who often was lauded by the city for reductions in homicides and shootings in his district, retired abruptly in 2018 after it was discovered he'd been collecting monthly Social Security payments intended for his mother, who died in 1994 at age 72.
The Social Security Administration said it was never notified of her death, which is why it continued to deposit her monthly Social Security benefits into a joint bank account she shared with her son, prosecutors said.
The scheme came to light when investigators noticed that Johnson's mother hadn't used Medicare benefits in 2017, when she would have been 96. The Social Security Administration mailed a letter to Johnson's mother at her last known address, requesting that she contact the agency in order to confirm her continued eligibility for benefits, which were ended when there was no response.

""This was not a crime of necessity or desperation. Nor was it an isolated incident or a momentary lapse in judgment,"" prosecutors wrote in a memo late last month. ""The only reason Johnson's theft came to an end in 2017 was because one of the Social Security Administration's program integrity initiatives prompted the agency to confirm whether Johnson's mother was still alive. Otherwise, Johnson simply would have continued stealing from Social Security.""
Johnson withdrew funds from the account in an ATM at his police station, prosecutors said.

""Withdrawing crime proceeds at the police station he oversaw as the district commander reflects a troubling lack of respect for the law and a cavalier attitude about the nature and seriousness of his criminal conduct,"" the memo said.

Prosecutors said Johnson spent all but 59 cents of the stolen funds.

In handing down Johnson's sentence, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah called his actions ""infuriating"" and questioned why he never thought to come forward and accept the consequences for his crimes, according to the Chicago Tribune.

""How many times (as a police commander) did you plead with people to come forward and accept responsibly for something?"" Shah said. ""Yet all that while, there was a crime being committed that you knew all about, and you did nothing to stop it."""
Juvenile center waited 35 minutes to call police when murder suspects escaped: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/nashville-juvenile-detention-center-waited-35-minutes-call/story?id=67452994,"
Nashville police are investigating a privately operated juvenile detention center where four teens, including two accused of murder, were able to escape through the front door, police said Monday.

Youth Opportunity Investments, the private detention contractor that manages the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center, waited more than a half hour before it told police that the teens escaped, according to the Metro Nashville Police Department, which is investigating the circumstances surrounding Saturday night’s escape.

Two of the four teens, including one charged with murder, were found and rearrested on Tuesday night in Madison, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville.
""In 30 minutes, with a fast walk, you could be 2 miles away,"" Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson told reporters Monday. ""I don't have any indication that a crime has been committed, that there was some overt act to assist in their escape, but certainly a lot of gross negligence.""

Two murder suspects, including Morris Marsh, 17, who remains at large, allegedly ran out of the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center at around 10 p.m. Saturday night along with two other inmates. Brandon Caruthers, 17, remains on the run from the two escapees charged with lesser crimes, authorities said.

The teens were on a work detail when their staff supervisor left them to address a fight at another location inside the facility, according to police. They managed to get onto an elevator and used staff protocols to ride to the unsecured ground floor where they went through a series of doors and exited to the outside.

Authorities said an employee of the detention center drove around the area looking for the escapees for 35 minutes before he eventually called police for assistance.
Investigators said they more than likely had assistance once they were outside.

Youth Opportunity said it was conducting an internal investigation into how the teens managed to escape. It said four employees had been placed on suspension pending the results of the internal probe, according to Nashville ABC affiliate WKRN.

""Youth Opportunity has provided a safe and secure environment for the youth and the citizens of Nashville. Youth Opportunity has heretofore experienced very few safety and security breaches,"" the company said in a statement. ""Youth Opportunity acknowledges that several members of its security personnel made improper decisions that, when combined, led to an opportunity for the four youth to leave the facility.""

Anderson said he ""had more questions than I had answers"" after reviewing a copy of Youth Opportunity's internal report, which is why he requested an investigation.
""In looking at their own internal report, I just saw a pattern of people not paying attention to what they should be doing, so that's the reason that I called for the review,"" Anderson said.

""What I saw in their report appeared to be a pattern of maybe nonchalant behavior,"" Anderson said.

Authorities said the teens are considered dangerous and are asking for the public's help in locating them.

Marsh is suspected of killing 19-year-old Charles Easley in April.

Caruthers had been transferred to adult court on an August 2018 armed robbery case in south Nashville, according to police.

ABC News does not normally name juveniles, but are doing so because police said they are dangerous individuals and have released their names and photos. Anyone with information about the escapees is asked to immediately call Nashville's Emergency Communications Center at 615-862-8600.

"*NSYNC, O-Town members on Lou Pearlman: 'My heart broke. ... He was a conman'",https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-nsync-town-learning-truth-lou-pearlman-heart/story?id=67630216,"
Boy bands Backstreet Boys and  *NSYNC helped define an era of pop culture in the '90s.

But while they were performing for sold-out arenas and selling millions of albums, their then-manager Lou Pearlman was reaping most of the financial benefits.

*NSYNC members Lance Bass and Chris Kirkpatrick, the members of O-Town and solo artist Sean van der Wilt spoke to ""20/20"" about their experiences with the notorious music mogul, who they say took advantage of their trust and took advantage of them financially.

""I was in the biggest band in the world and selling millions of records…but I can't even afford my apartment in Orlando. I couldn't even get a car,"" Bass told ""20/20.""

Watch the full story on ""20/20"" FRIDAY, Dec. 13 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC
""[Pearlman] could get anything he wanted,"" said O-Town member Jacob Underwood. ""I feel like [he was] just a miserable person who wanted all these things, and then got them, and [was] still miserable. … That's a very sick, sad man to be around.""

Pearlman pleaded guilty in 2008 to conspiracy, money laundering and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding in connection to a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving his TransContinental empire. He died in 2016 at age 62 while serving a 25-year prison sentence.

""When I found out about the Ponzi scheme, my heart broke and was basically ripped out, because now I realized he was a conman,"" Kirkpatrick said.
Bass helped bring the extent of Pearlman's schemes and deception to light in his YouTube Originals documentary, ""The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story,"" which debuted in April.

""I knew he was a scamster,"" Bass said. ""It was one of the many jaw-dropping things that I discovered in producing 'The Boy Band Con.'""

Pearlman was running a blimp business when he decided to start a boy band. At the time, New Kids on the Block was enormously popular.

In 1991, according to Forbes magazine, NKOTB made more money than Madonna or Michael Jackson. Pearlman was blown away by how much money NKOTB was making.

""I was invited to come down to one of their [New Kids on the Block] shows, all the [fans] screaming, I was like, 'My God, what's going on here,'"" Pearlman told ""20/20"" in a 2000 interview. ""And these girls were buying these t-shirts and hats and chains and posters. I was like, 'Man, this is exciting.' I mean, not to mention, OK, there's a tinkle into the cash register. No question about it… I said, 'I think I can do that. I think I can put a group like that together.'""
Pearlman, a Queens, New York, native, had moved to Orlando, Florida, in the early 1990s. He put an ad in the Orlando Sentinel that said: Producer seeks male teen singers that move well between 16 and 19 years of age, wanted for a New Kids type singing dance group.

""Florida is a great place to be if you want to start a boy band because there's a lot of young talent down there auditioning for roles at the theme parks,"" John Seabrook, a journalist and author of the book, ""The Song Machine,"" told ""20/20.""

A.J. McLean, Howie Dorough and Nick Carter all auditioned for Pearlman.

""Those are the three originals and we needed five,"" said Jeanne Tanzy Williams, who originally managed McLean but also became co-manager of the group for a short time. ""Lou Pearlman actually found Kevin [Richardson] at a Disney parade… playing Aladdin.""

Once Richardson signed on, Tanzy Williams said Richardson recommended his cousin, Brian Littrell, who at the time sang at church in their home state of Kentucky. With Littrell onboard, Pearlman had his first boy band in the making.
Williams said Pearlman established a sort of boy band boot camp, providing them with choreographers, voice coaches and tutors. The boys practiced for hours in extremely hot conditions in Pearlman’s blimp hangar in Kissimmee, Florida.

In May 1993, Backstreet Boys made their first public appearance at SeaWorld. Pearlman made a tape of the performance and sent it around to people in the industry.

Johnny Wright and his then-wife Donna, who were the road managers for New Kids on the Block, saw the tape and thought the boys had something special.
""What I had heard about him prior to meeting him [was] that he was a billionaire,"" Johnny Wright said. ""He runs around in a Rolls Royce, he owns all these blimps. He also told me he was a writer and a producer. I had no reason to doubt anything that he was telling me at that time, and he had already put the band together. I just felt like, 'Hey, we lucked into something here.'""

Johnny and Donna Wright became Backstreet Boys' managers; Jeanne Tanzy Williams says Pearlman told her she was out. The boys were sent out on a tour performing at high schools.

""They would do three shows a day in three different schools,"" Johnny Wright told ""20/20."" ""They would bust out on the gym floor and the girls would lose their mind and they had never heard of them before.""

Backstreet Boys had a hard time getting a record deal at first but eventually they were signed by Jive Records. Pearlman pressured them to sign a contract that was heavily weighted in his favor. In addition to being their manager, Pearlman made himself the sixth member of the band,  meaning that he would reap additional financial rewards.

Pearlman defended his business practices to ""20/20"" in a 2000 interview, saying in part, ""Backstreet Boys is a part of my life as much as it is theirs.""

With a record deal signed, the boys needed to find good material. Jive had a relationship with some Swedish producers and they sent Backstreet Boys to Stockholm to work with young producer-songwriters Max Martin and the late Denniz Pop. Martin and Pop had written hits for the group Ace of Base.

Max Martin would go on to become one of the most successful hit makers of our time. He wrote the Britney Spears song “…Baby One More Time.” He co-wrote Katy Perry’s “Roar” and he co-wrote “Shake It Off” with Taylor Swift.

With Backstreet Boys in the early '90s, he co-wrote, “We’ve Got It Going On,” with Pop, which became a huge hit in Europe for the group. German audiences in particular went wild for Backstreet Boys.
“At that point in time boy bands were big in Germany,” Wright said. “I knew if they had their best shot, it was in a market where boy bands were super successful… We used to call America, ‘no fan land.’”

Martin also co-wrote Backstreet Boys' hit, “Quit Playing Games with My Heart.” It was that song and famous music video that made the group successful in the United States. The song was No. 2 on the charts in 1997.

As Backstreet Boys' fame grew, Pearlman secretly started working on putting together his next boy band. This new group became *NSYNC and it was made up of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Lance Bass.

""When I first sat down with Lou…  he had it in his mind that he was ready to have another band,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""So right away I was totally in. But he had this weird-- it was always like a secret. Like, everything was, you know, 'I'm doing this, but I'm also working with them. So don't tell anybody about this. Don't say that I'm involved with you. Don't say that you really even know me, but I'm going to try to help you guys out.'""

Kirkpatrick said he suggested Pearlman consider Timberlake for the new band.

“When I got a hold of Justin-- the first thing Justin's mom suggested was, ‘He's been working really closely with one of his friends from ‘The Mickey Mouse Club’… JC [Chasez],"" Kirkpatrick said.

Both Timberlake and Chasez had been cast members on the Disney variety show, “The All-New Mickey Mouse Club,” when it ended production in 1994 and were looking for other opportunities. Kirkpatrick then suggested Joey Fatone, whom he knew from his days performing at Universal.

They had four, but Pearlman wanted a five-part harmony, so they needed one more.

“We needed to find the bass,” Kirkpatrick said. “Justin's vocal coach had called and said, ‘I've got this kid out of  Mississippi and I want you to hear him.'""

That kid was Lance Bass.
""My love of music really began [with] singing in my church,"" Bass said. ""In Mississippi, no one ever dreamt of being a successful musician. It just was kind of out the cards for someone like me.""

Bass was a sophomore in high school when he got the call that he said changed his life. He said Pearlman and Timberlake asked him to fly to Orlando to audition -- it was Bass' first time on a plane.

""I arrive at baggage claim, and there's 14-year-old Justin Timberlake sitting on the baggage belt looking really cool and sly, and I'm like, 'Wow…this kid's cool,'"" Bass said. ""Then you have Lou Pearlman. And they pull up in…a limo and a Rolls Royce, and that's how I'm introduced to this whole world.""
Bass said he instantly liked Pearlman after meeting him for the first time.

""When you meet Lou you immediately trust him for some reason. He had…a jolly personality that you…felt like he was family,"" Bass said. ""And when you see Lou…with his Rolls Royces and limos and his beautiful mansion…you trusted that he knew what he was doing just because of all the things he had.""

As he had done with Backstreet Boys, Pearlman put the *NSYNC members into a boot camp of sorts with choreographers, voice lessons and tutors. Bass said they would practice dance moves for hours in Pearlman’s blimp hangar, which Bass says would get incredibly hot.

""And at that time…Lou Pearlman funded our group,"" Bass said. ""So he rented us our house, so we didn't have to pay for rent. He would pay for dinners when we would go out for dinners… He's family to you. He's taking care of you.""

*NSYNC made its first public appearance at Disney’s Pleasure Island in October 1995. Word got back to Johnny Wright who was touring with Backstreet Boys in Germany that Pearlman had another band.

""I called Lou and I was like, 'You have another boy band I don't know about?' He was, 'No, no, no.' He goes, 'This kid Chris Kirkpatrick…wants to put a band together and he just comes to me every once in a while to ask for some advice, but I got nothing to do with that band,'"" Wright said.

""Backstreet Boys...were worried about *NSYNC. They were actually concerned…they were going to put them out of business,"" Seabrook said. ""So when Backstreet Boys found out that Lou Pearlman was the manager behind their greatest rival…they were outraged.""

Pearlman started TransContinental Records, an indie label. However, it was still in its infancy, so he needed a major U.S. record label for distribution -- a feat that would prove difficult.

""Every record exec out there turned us down,"" Bass said. ""They were like, 'Nothing like this would ever work in America. This is way too cheesy.'""

""Our clothes were just horrible,"" he added. ""They were always just oversized. No one really cared. There was no stylist that came in and was like, 'Oh we're going to do this and we're going to fit you.' No, it was, like, 'Here's a rack of stuff.'""

At the time, boy bands were still in demand in Germany. So, following the same formula as Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC went to Europe to perform and worked with Max Martin, who co-wrote *NSYNC’s first two hits, “I Want You Back” and “Tearing Up My Heart.”

“In Europe, we were on the cover of every magazine,” Bass said. “And then when we released our first single and album, it blew up. It was huge.”

Bass said *NSYNC’s trajectory in the U.S. changed once the group performed at a Disney concert that Backstreet Boys had turned down. The Disney Channel played the concert over and over.

“The Disney Channel concert really changed our career,” Bass said. “It was incredible, and that one gig right there, to me, is what made us in America.”
But while *NSYNC's star was rising, Bass said Backstreet fans ""were mad. They were like, ‘Oh we can't have another group like this.’ So it was a hard start for us…and that's when the rivalry started with the fans.”

In 1998, *NSYNC had two albums on the charts -- their self-titled debut album and their Christmas album, “Home For Christmas,” which featured the song “Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.”

“To this day, I think the Christmas album's one of my favorite albums that we've ever done,” Kirkpatrick said. “It's timeless. And as soon as that thing came out, then it's more videos and next single on the record. And we were just holding on for the ride.”

“We'd get so busy we didn't have time to cut our hair or to put bleach in our hair,” Bass added. “So that's when I started just kind of getting this bleach and putting it in my hair and just putting my fingertips in it, and that's how the frosted tips were born.”

In the background, Pearlman was using the success of Backstreet Boys, and later *NSYNC, to not only lure new talent, but also to use the bands’ enormous success to entice people to invest in Pearlman’s TransContinental empire, which eventually he claimed included the record label, plus an airline, a film and music studio, talent and travel agencies as well as restaurants and real estate.
""We never ever flew on a TransContinental airplane,"" Bass said. ""We would fly to different places over in Europe, and we'd always be on these Delta flights, you know, in coach. And I always thought it was weird that someone that was in the airline industry couldn't help us out a little bit [with] getting to places.""

Meanwhile, after years of touring, selling out arenas and promoting albums, both Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC were starting to wonder when they were going to get paid.

""With all the success you would think that we were making hand-over-fist money and we were printing money and whatever, and it just wasn't the case,"" Kirkpatrick said.
In 1998, Bass and Kirkpatrick said Pearlman flew them and their families out to Los Angeles for what he called a check presentation ceremony and a celebration dinner. Both said they went into the dinner thinking that they were about to become millionaires.

""At the end of the dinner, we have all these envelopes sitting in front of us… I knew my life was about to change,"" Bass said. ""I knew we had worked so hard. So I knew what that check should be or I was hoping would be…in the best of worlds, $1 million would've been, like, 'Oh my [God].' That's what I thought we deserved.""

But when they opened their checks, Bass said the amount was for $10,000 each.

""I didn't want to seem ungrateful because at that point, yes, $10,000 was a lot of money,"" Bass said. ""We went back to the hotel room and that's when it all just hit me. I was so disappointed. And I ripped up the check. Like… I knew something was wrong.""

The band had Chasez's uncle, who was an attorney, look over their contracts, and he called it ""the worst contract I've ever read in my entire life,'"" Bass said.

That's when Bass said *NSYNC discovered they had the same contracts as Backstreet Boys, where Pearlman legally had made himself the sixth member of their group, allowing him to rake in one-sixth of the band's profits, on top of taking in management fees.

After their attorneys found a small loophole in their contract with Pearlman's label TransContinential Records, *NSYNC jumped to Jive Records, the same record label as Backstreet Boys.

As a result, TransContinental Records, along with RCA parent BMG Entertainment -- the label that distributed *NSYNC albums --  hit the band with a $150 million breach-of-contract lawsuit in an effort to stop the move and stop them from performing or recording using the name *NSYNC, among other demands.

""[Pearlman] knew that we were able to sign with a different label but he still owned our name. He was the sixth member of the group and he owned the name *NSYNC. So he took our name and sued us.... so we could never use it,"" Bass said. ""And that's why we ended up in court.""
In 1998, Backstreet Boys filed a lawsuit, claiming that they had only received $300,000 since 1993 while Pearlman had made $10 million. Pearlman defended his business practices, saying that he had spent $3 million on Backstreet Boys to launch their careers before the band had been profitable.
Pearlman was ousted as Backstreet Boys' manager but the settlement agreement they reached gave him $30 million and he continued earning a portion of the band's profits.

In 1999, *NSYNC, Pearlman and BMG Entertainment reached a settlement which included giving *NSYNC members the right to control their name. As a result, Pearlman was also out as their manager.

The following year, in early 2000, *NSYNC its third album, “No Strings Attached.""

“'No Strings Attached’ just became the theme,” Kirkpatrick said. “It became our battle cry of, ‘We don't owe anybody anymore… we have no ties to anything but each other … and our fans.""

Despite the legal battles with his most profitable bands, Pearlman continued to seek opportunities to launch new bands and artists.
""We just thought that it was us and the Backstreet Boys and that's all that he was really focusing on right now, not knowing that he was developing tons of bands on the side,"" Bass said.

Pearlman went on to create a boy band called LFO, whose song ""Summer Girls"" peaked at No. 3 on the charts in 1999, as well as the bands C- Note, Take 5, the girl group Innosense and O-Town -- the winners of his TV show ""Making the Band,"" a franchise that began on ABC in 2000 and later moved to MTV.

""Lou Pearlman, for all of his faults, was an amazing casting director,"" said Dave Holmes, a judge on ""Making the Band."" ""He had an ear for a good voice but that was not the most important thing… The most important thing was charisma… He really saw things in people that would not blossom for years.”

But Bass said that when he saw O-Town come out of ""Making The Band"" in 2000, he initially felt sorry for the new group.

""Because at that point, I knew who Lou Pearlman was and I knew he was taking advantage of people and I knew what contract these guys would eventually be signing,"" Bass said.

Much like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, four members of O-Town said they also struggled with getting Pearlman to pay them. In their contract, Pearlman didn't make himself a legal member of the group but owned the rights to the band's name, which led to legal battles years later.

""He promised tour support -- we'd get a big tour -- and then the day of the tour support, no money comes in,"" Underwood said. ""Playing with our money, not able to get sponsorship because we have to get his clearance for the [band] name, and it just became a headache from day one.""
And as he'd done with Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, Pearlman ran the boys through somewhat of a boy band boot camp. He also encouraged all of his bands to call him, ""Big Poppa"" or ""Papa Lou.""

""He was 'Papa Lou' to Backstreet and he was 'Papa Lou' to us [*NSYNC], but we couldn't tell anybody he was 'Papa Lou,'"" Kirkpatrick said. ""He just was this fatherly figure that we never had any worries around him because … he was the money guy.""

""Some of it was really weird and awkward and uncomfortable. But, you know, for the most part, you know, it was just Lou,"" he added.

Rumors of Pearlman's being inappropriate with some of the young men he was managing circulated.

""The thing about Lou, there was an endearing childlike quality to him,"" said O-Town's Erik-Michael Estrada. ""You never automatically thought that there's something devious behind the requests… Playing chicken in the pool, 'Who's going to be on my shoulders?' Yeah, 'You look like you're tired. Let me give you a massage. Let me see your abs. Are they coming in?' None of those things seemed weird at the time.""

""I never saw anything until after we left,"" Bass said. ""There was rumblings of maybe Lou was sleeping with boys to get into groups and all that. So I don't know what was real, what wasn't.""

Singer and songwriter Sean van der Wilt has worked hard to build a successful career in Hollywood despite the rocky start he said he had working with Pearlman, who he says ""made many advances"" on him when he was signed to Pearlman's label in the early 2000s. Van der Wilt said the advances made him ""uncomfortable.""
""The first couple times he put his arm around -- was hugging me -- but it was in a way [that it] was just a little too close for comfort,"" van der Wilt said. ""By the third time, I was sitting on his bed, and he joked and fell on top of me. I was like, 'Whoa, Lou,' and he was like, 'Oh, come on. We're buddies.'""

Seth Abramovitch, who writes for The Hollywood Reporter, asked Pearlman about the rumors concerning inappropriate misconduct with some of his young performers. “His explanation was that anyone whose star he actually launched were happy with him. …..If their careers fizzled, they had a grudge, and that's why they said these things about him,” Abramovitch told ABC News.

By 2006, the feds were investigating Pearlman for running a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme related to his TransContinental empire. In 2008, Pearlman pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, one count of money laundering and one count of making a false claim in a bankruptcy proceeding. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Backstreet Boys has continued to achieve commercial success as a group. The band released a new album, ""DNA,"" and concluded a Las Vegas residency this year.
*NSYNC went ""on hiatus"" in 2002. They reunited this past April, without Timberlake, to perform with singer Ariana Grande at Coachella Music Festival.
After enjoying three years of success, O-Town disbanded in 2003. Underwood said their inability to own the rights to their band's name made it ""impossible"" to make music or market off their success.
In 2013, O-Town regrouped to launch a comeback and filed paperwork in 2017 to obtain the rights to their band's name. This year, however, they faced another legal hurdle: Universal Music Group is challenging the band's claim to the name ""O-Town,"" arguing that it's too similar to their trademarked Motown Recordings brand.

""Nobody else is paying for it or building it up -- it's us,"" Underwood said. ""After 20 years of being a band, [the label] decides that they think that O-Town and Motown are too close of a name and that people would confuse the two.""
Van der Wilt's career, though it had hit a bump, eventually started looking up again. He began working with Rihanna on a promo tour and booked a dancing role in the 2010 movie ""Burlesque."" Most recently, he worked with Cher as an associate choreographer and dancer, although he left that role to choreograph and appear in the ninth season of the FX show ""American Horror Story."" A producer on that show, he said, helped him land a choreography role on Fox's ""911: Lone Star."" He also just released a single called ""Silence.""

Van der Wilt said that although he considered Pearlman a friend, the music producer never apologized to him for everything he'd been put through, which included his getting kicked out of a California mansion that went into foreclosure due to nonpayment by Pearlman's company. Still, van der Wilt said he believes there was good in Pearlman.

""Lou did have a big heart. He did. He cared about people. It was very apparent. He [was] always hugging everybody. Everybody was his family and I know it deep down inside,"" he said. ""I know he meant that. It's just, his way of thinking with money and wanting all the attention was crooked. That's how I feel.""
When Pearlman died of heart failure behind bars in 2016, Bass said, ""I was so confused on exactly how to feel.""

""I'm like, 'How could you die right now when we don't have this closure? You need to apologize,'"" he continued.

""The minute…you'd start to cry, you'd start to laugh,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""And the minute you'd start to laugh, you'd start to get angry, and the minute I was angry, I started to feel bad for the whole thing that happened. It was the most confusing moment probably that I've ever had.""

""I know that a lot of the other guys are bitter,"" he added. ""I understand that because like I said, it's so many emotions. But…I wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for him… and it sucks.""

Looking back now, Bass said he feels glad to have known Pearlman.

""There's so many life lessons that you learn from everyone else's mistakes -- from your mistakes,"" Bass said. ""He helped start my career. He funded it… I don't know where I'd be without him. So you have to give him that credit.""

But others, like O-Town members Underwood and Dan Miller, say they feel differently.

""I don't feel like [Pearlman] is responsible for my career. But I know that there's other members of my band who feel conflicted because we have a career because of this band that he put together,"" Miller said. ""But he also is just a disgusting human being on so many levels.""

""The Ponzi scheme victims… We were all in it together. We were all abused by the same person,"" Underwood added. ""Hopefully you don't feel as lonely…as you did…because you have a big family now. We're all connected."""
Class ring returned to family 52 years after it was lost in lake,https://abcnews.go.com/US/class-ring-returned-family-50-years-lost-missouri/story?id=67438482,"
A woman returned a class ring to a family 52 years after it was lost and around 30 years after she found it in a Missouri lake.

Amanda Lager, 39, dug up the ring during a fishing trip with her father at Lake Annette in Cass County, Missouri, in about 1988, when she was about 9 years old, she told Kansas City ABC station KMBC.
""I was bored, digging around in the dirt and I happened to look down and see a shiny little circle in the mud,"" she said.
Upon cleaning it, Lager and her father noticed it was from nearby Belton High School for the class of 1967 and had the initials ""B.H."" inscribed on it. However, the pair wasn't sure how to find the owner at the time, so they put it away and forgot about it until Lager came across it again while helping her parents move.

On Nov. 24, Lager posted a photo of the ring to Facebook, saying she would ""love"" to give it to the owner or the owner's family by Christmas.
Within an hour, Lager found out the ring belonged to Bill Huffman, who lost it two months after he got it in 1967 while saving a friend who was drowning in the lake.

""His buddy was almost going under from hypothermia and he was helping him get to the bank and the water was so cold that he lost his ring,"" Bill Huffman's younger brother, Jim Huffman, told KMBC.
Bill Huffman died at the age of 40 in a single-engine plane crash in Raymore, Missouri, in 1988 -- around the same time Lager found the ring, she wrote on Facebook. So, she returned the ring to his brother instead.

KMBC caught the moment Lager and Jim Huffman met for the first time and she presented him with the long-lost ring.
""Man, that's unbelievable,"" Jim Huffman said, describing his brother as having a ""love of adventure"" and someone who ""lived each day to the fullest.""

""I don’t think I’ve ever known anybody that did that,"" he said.
Both Lager and Jim Huffman believe the timing in which she found the ring and reunited it with Bill Huffman's family was an act of fate.

""Maybe I was meant to find it that day and hold onto it all this time and find the owner and bring it to them in the perfect moment,"" Lager said.

""It's really something,"" Jim Huffman said. ""God works in mysterious ways."""
"Cow cuddling, flying with miniature horses part of expanding use of support animals",https://abcnews.go.com/US/cow-cuddling-flying-miniature-horses-part-rapidly-expanding/story?id=67473964,"
Abrea Hensley and her miniature therapy horse, Flirty, are quite the sight. Whether at the grocery store or in the park, Flirty attracts a lot of attention.

""Going out with Flirty is definitely one of the most interesting parts of my life at this point,"" said Hensley. ""I get a lot of questions.""

This year, the duo even took a flight together after the Federal Aviation Administration cleared miniature service horses to fly.

""It was the first time Flirty had ever flown,"" Hensley told ABC News. ""Everybody at the airport was really nice and really welcoming and helpful. The experience itself was really and truly one of the most freeing experiences I’ve had recently.""

But don’t expect to run into Flirty on a plane anytime soon; Hensley doesn’t plan on making a habit with her flying horse. ""It’s not something I plan on doing a lot, just because it is a lot to ask of Flirty,"" she said.

Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC.
Hensley said she battled post-traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety for years before her care team suggested a service animal might help her symptoms.

""I [am] allergic to dogs so I couldn’t get a service dog,"" she said, ""Miniature horses are the only alternative to dogs that are allowed under the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act].""
That was two and a half years ago, and now Flirty goes everywhere with Hensley. ""We just immediately had a connection that you don't find very often with an animal. You know it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime type bond that we have,"" Hensley said.

Flirty assists Hensley in a multitude of ways: ""Before I actually have an anxiety attack she can predict based on my rising heart rate and cortisol levels that an anxiety attack is going to happen. She also helps me to get through them faster. She will sit there and nudge me and lick me until I start to calm down.""
Hensley also has some mobility issues so Flirty ""assists me with some walking ... as well,"" she said.

The use of service animals has expanded over the years. Once reserved for the vision and hearing impaired, service animals are now commonly seen on college campuses to provide stress relief during exams, in courtrooms to assist children during difficult testimonies and by the sides of veterans who experience PTSD.

A service horse is a natural choice for some.

""There are a number of reasons that somebody might choose a service horse besides just dog allergies,"" Hensley said. ""Horses are much better suited for mobility assistance … [and] there is also the issue of the lifespan. A miniature horse will live to be approximately 35 years old, so that's about the lifespan of two to three service dogs. So that's a huge advantage there.""
ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton, said there is a difference between service animals and emotional support animals.

""Generally, when we hear the word service animal or service dog, those are specifically trained animals to carry out a very specific task for a specific problem,"" she said. ""When you talk about just an emotional support animal, that's usually an animal for whom a relationship exists with that person and the presence of that animal is soothing and comforting for that person.""

Ashton addied, ""Anyone who owns a pet knows how soothing and calming a pet [can] be.""

The use of ""comfort"" animals on flights has skyrocketed lately. United Airlines saw a 77% increase from 2016 to 2017, and Delta has seen its numbers double in the recent past. Most of these emotional support animals are dogs, but other ponies may soon join Flirty in the ranks of flying horses after the recent FAA rule change.
Some say, however, that the allowances have gone too far. Last year a woman was banned from a flight after she tried to bring her emotional support peacock on the plane, and many airlines have weight and breed restrictions.

""Unfortunately, I think the influx of all kinds of animals on planes and public transportation in general has possibly swung the pendulum a little bit too far,"" said Ashton. ""Just because a physician or health professional can certify a person as potentially benefiting from an animal is very different than going through the often very rigorous steps, selection and training process that many people who have service animals or support animals have to go through.""

In upstate New York, a different kind of emotional support animal is providing moving experiences for many visitors to Mountain Horse Farm, home to Bella and Bonnie the comfort cows.
Suzanne Vullers and her husband, Rudi, own and operate Mountain Horse Farm, in Naples, New York, which doubles as a bed and breakfast and spa. But many guests come here for one specific service that’s generated a lot of buzz: cow cuddling.

""It naturally relaxes you,"" said Suzanne Vullers. ""A lot of people are looking for mindfulness. They’re looking for ways to calm down their head and their body. When you are with a large animal like that, they command your presence. ... There's no way you can be somewhere else when you're with them because they're so big. And that creates a natural mindfulness.""

It's a practice Vullers said hails from her native Netherlands called ""koe knuffelen,"" which translates to ""cow hugging,"" and it’s meant to get people back in touch with nature.

""Touching a living being kind of relaxes you and it's very similar to you getting a massage,"" she said. ""The benefits are very similar as well.""
When visitors come to the farm they are led out to the pasture to meet the animals while they relax in the shade. Then the cuddling commences. Suzanne said seeing people lie down next to her animals is ""her favorite moment"" of the experience.

""It makes you go so quiet, and it’s so relaxing, and it’s such a joy that they want to connect with you in that way,"" she said.

Sheryl and Brandon Hertel, from Buffalo, New York, visited Mountain Horse farm late last summer. They came to celebrate Sheryl’s birthday.

""I thought she was kidding at first,"" Brandon Hertel said of his wife. ""She wants to pet the cows.""

""I just hope they like me,"" said Sheryl Hertel. ""As weird as that sounds!""
The duo set out with Vullers, entering the pasture as Bonnie and Bella relaxed. Vullers instructed the couple on how to sit with the cow so that her head would lay in their laps.

The session was a success.

""It was amazing,"" said Sheryl Hertel. ""Everything I thought it would be ... you felt like they could actually understand you. ... My heart was ready to explode. I loved it.""

""It was surprisingly relaxing,"" added her husband. ""You’d think interacting with a big animal wouldn’t be relaxing, but it is shockingly relaxing.""

For some, it’s about more than a stress-free afternoon. Hensley said her connection to Flirty saved her life.

""My treatment team was very concerned that I wouldn't live more than a year or two without having a service animal,"" she said. ""So because of Flirty I am still here. I am still able to go out and function in society. And she's just been a huge lifesaver and complete life changer for me. I'm very grateful to have her."" "
Female crane operator’s ‘very dangerous’ life in the sky,https://abcnews.go.com/US/women-make-great-crane-operators-west-coasts-female/story?id=66823336,"
Sitting on her perch 160 feet above the Port of Los Angeles, Maria Adame gently maneuvers her crane as she offloads containers weighing over 50,000 pounds, full of everyday goods that just made the trek across the Pacific Ocean.

""Everybody looks so small down there,"" Adame said. ""You feel closer to God.""
Adame, the West Coast's only female crane instructor and a longshoreman, has been working in the ports since the age of 22 when she was a single mother of two.

""I used to walk there with my baby in the stroller. I went for six months straight every day,"" she said.
Back then, part-time employees would put their driver's licenses in a box, hoping their names would be called for the day.

""They'd shake it up and if they pulled your driver's license, then you know, you were picked to go to work,"" Adame said. ""My first job was a forklift job.""

Adame remembers the struggle of being only one of a few women on the waterfront. ""It was almost like 'don't tell me I can't, because I will,'"" adding, ""You're up against quite a bit. You have to learn how to not just be physically strong because there was a lot of labor involved you know, just the mental part of it.""
A longshoreman's main job is to load and unload the cargo ships that are bringing in electronics, airplane parts, clothes and other household goods from all over the world. They work in a variety of roles on the docks from forklift operator to driver to crane operator.

The Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, where Adame works, are two of the busiest container ports in the U.S., moving about 9.5 million containers in 2018.
The job is not for the faint of heart. ""If you get hurt down here, you're going to lose. Probably lose a limb or you could possibly lose your life,"" Adame warned. And ""not really small injuries, usually pretty big,"" she explained.

She credits her male colleagues for helping her get where she is today. ""I got really lucky, the partner that they set me up with was very kind to me and he taught me how to operate the machine.""

However, Adame believes women have the magic touch.
""I don't know if it's because we are good at multitasking or we're mothers and we just know how to do these things ... women, we make great, great crane operators.""

When looking back, Adame said it brings tears to her eyes to see how far she's come but recognizes the struggle was worth it.

""It's a big accomplishment to be able to climb the ladder and make it,"" she said.

Minors questioned in 'horrifying' fatal stabbing of college student: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/18-year-barnard-college-student-tessa-rane-major/story?id=67679789,"
An 18-year-old college student was stabbed to death in New York City, police said.

Tessa Rane Majors, a Barnard College student, was found unconscious with multiple stab wounds near Morningside Park in Upper Manhattan Wednesday evening, police said. She was rushed to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to a statement from the New York City Police Department.
The 18-year-old was walking through the park, right by the campuses of Barnard and Columbia University, when she was engaged by an unknown number of suspects, NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison told reporters at a news conference.

During a struggle, one of the suspects pulled out a knife and stabbed Majors several times, Harrison said. A knife was recovered from the scene, but it is unclear if it is the weapon used in the stabbing.
After Majors pulled herself out of the park, a school public safety officer at his post at 116th Street and Morningside Drive ""came to her aid immediately upon recognizing that she was injured,"" according to a statement from Columbia University, which called reports that the security guard was not at his post ""inaccurate.""

""Officers stationed at this location do not make rounds that cause them to leave their post,"" the statement said.
One to three people are believed to have been involved in the stabbing, and several minors are being questioned, Harrison said.

There have been no arrests so far, police said. The NYPD is increasing patrols near Morningside Park and Columbia University.
A person of interest was being questioned on Thursday in connection with the case but has since been released, according to two police sources.

Majors was a first-year student at Barnard College, a private women's liberal arts college in Manhattan that sits just outside Morningside Park, alongside Columbia University.
Majors' family said in a statement that they ""lost a very special, very talented, and very well-loved young woman.""

""Tess shone bright in this world, and our hearts will never be the same,"" the family said.
The school's president, Sian Leah Beilock, said in a statement that Majors ""was fatally injured during an armed robbery that occurred off campus in Morningside Park.""

""Tessa was just beginning her journey at Barnard and in life,"" Beilock said. ""We mourn this devastating murder of an extraordinary young woman and member of our community. This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the stabbing as ""horrifying"" in a news conference Thursday morning, while NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it an ""absolute tragedy."""

Ford recalls big pickups; tailgates can open unexpectedly,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ford-recalls-big-pickups-tailgates-open-unexpectedly-67544099,"
Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 262,000 heavy-duty pickup trucks in the U.S. and Canada because the tailgates can open unexpectedly.
The recall covers F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks from the 2017 through 2019 model years. All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.
Ford says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches. That could allow loose cargo to fall onto the road.
The company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries. Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected.
Dealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch. Owners will be notified by mail during the week of Jan. 20."
Officer fired after allegedly face-slamming teen,https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-sheriff-deputy-fired-camera-allegedly-face-slamming/story?id=67686386,"
A deputy sheriff was fired after being seen on cell phone video allegedly slamming a teenage boy's face on the pavement.

Broward County, Florida, Sheriff Gregory Tony announced Wednesday that Christopher Krickovich was terminated for excessive force despite the state's Professional Standards/Human Rights Committee's (PSHRC) recommendation to exonerate him of any wrongdoing for the April 18 incident.
""When my deputies do the right thing, I will always support them and have their back. But I will not stand idly by while anyone violates his or her sworn duty to protect,"" said Tony in a press release. ""Even a singular incident of excessive force by one of our deputies creates distrust between the community and our organization, and that is something I will not allow.""

Krickovich was seen on camera allegedly pepper-spraying and slamming a 15-year-old student's face onto the ground outside of a McDonald's in Tamarac, Florida, during an arrest. Officer Gregory LaCerra was also present and allegedly involved in the violent arrest.

Afterwards, prosecutors claimed, the two officers filed false charges against the teen in order to cover up the attack.
After the video was posted on social media, the pair was variously charged in July 2019 with misdemeanor crimes including battery, falsifying records and conspiracy to falsify records, prosecutors said. A third officer was also charged in the attack but was found not guilty after a jury trial in September 2019 for one count of falsifying records.

Krickovich and LaCerra both have entered not guilty pleas and their criminal cases are ongoing.

Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, previously told the Associated Press that the Tamarac area is a hot spot for after school incidents with students threatening and harassing the mostly elderly clientele. Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.
Pending Tony's investigation -- that included results from PSHRC which ""investigates employment, housing and public accommodations discrimination, ethics, Wage Recovery, Living Wage, and Cone of Silence violations,"" according to their website -- Krickovich and LaCerra were suspended without pay.

""Like most people who watched the video evidence, I was disgusted by the obvious abuse of authority, but it is important for us to follow due process,"" said the sheriff, who made his decision after an internal affairs investigation.

Sue-Ann Robinson, one of the civil attorneys representing the teenager and his family, held a press conference to explain that Krickovich's termination is not a ""win"" -- ""but it's definitely a step in the right direction,"" she said.

""As a society we cannot allow abuse on our most vulnerable. The separation of one of the officers from the Sheriff’s Office for slamming [a 15-year-old's] head into the ground and filing false charges to cover it up -- is a step in the right direction,"" wrote Robinson on her Instagram account Thursday to accompany a clip of the press conference.

Tony was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January 2019 to an acting role as the head of the department after the former sheriff, Scott Israel, was fired from the post, accused of mishandling the department's response to the February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Once Tony was in his position, he launched further investigations into the Parkland shooting, firing two more deputies in June 2019 for failing to respond to the scene and stop the alleged gunman. "
4 shooting incidents happened on military bases in the US in 2019,https://abcnews.go.com/US/shooting-incidents-occurred-military-bases-us-2019/story?id=67543975,"
For the second time this week, a military base in the United States faced an active shooter incident. The latest on Friday in Pensacola, Florida, has left four people, including the shooter, dead.

The Friday shooting marked the fourth shooting incident to occur on a military base in the U.S. in 2019, according to news reports.
On New Year's Day, 20-year-old Lance Cpl. Riley Kuznia was killed by another on-duty Marine at the Washington, D.C., Marine Barracks.
Lance Cpl. Andrew M. Johnson was charged with murder in the shooting, which was originally classified as a death investigation rather than homicide, meaning it may have been an accident. A redacted copy of the charge sheets, obtained by Task & Purpose, said Johnson jokingly pointed his pistol at Kuznia's head and pulled the trigger, showing ""wanton disregard for human life."" Johnson entered a not guilty plea and his case is still pending.
At the Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on April 5, 2019, a 25-year-old male Navy sailor was killed by base security after shooting a female sailor in the parking lot. The woman was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries.

Navy police reported the scene as an active shooting incident and it was later deemed a ""domestic"" incident, according to Navy Times.
A 22-year-old active duty sailor killed two people and injured another on Dec. 4, 2019 at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard near Honolulu, Hawaii, according to authorities.

The shooter opened fire on shipyard personnel with his M4 service rifle and then used his M9 service pistol to shoot and kill himself, an official said.
An active shooter was reported at theNaval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, on Dec. 6, 2019. Four people, including the suspected shooter, were killed.
In the U.S. between 2000 and 2018, there were 277 active shooter incidents -- ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area"" -- identified by the FBI. In total, 2,430 people were either killed or injured.

Seven of those active shooter incidents were on military property.

"Woman, dog rescued from sinking car after she crashed it into 'dark murky' water",https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-dog-rescued-sinking-car-crashed-dark-murky/story?id=67489833,"
A woman and her dog were saved in a ""heroic rescue"" after she crashed her car into a body of water in Florida, officials said.

The woman, whom police did not identify, was pulled from the sinking vehicle after a sergeant with the Martin County Sheriff's Office punched out her window, according to a statement from the sheriff's office.

Officials said she crashed into a ""dark murky"" body of water in Indiantown on Tuesday.
Officers jumped back into the water after the woman said her dog was still in the car.
Thankfully, police said, they also were able to rescue the dog, which wasn't injured.
The woman was taken to a local hospital for observation.
The Martin County Sheriff's Office described the rescue as ""an amazing job."""
"Missing college student died from gunshot wound, authorities say",https://abcnews.go.com/US/aniah-blanchard-stepdaughter-ufc-fighter-died-gunshot-wound/story?id=67448148,"
Investigators have determined that Aniah Blanchard, the 19-year-old stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight fighter Walt Harris who disappeared in October, died of a gunshot wound.

Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes did not elaborate on where Blanchard was shot but told reporters in a news conference Monday that her manner of death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner.
Blanchard was last seen at a convenience store in Auburn, Alabama, on Oct. 23. Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, has been charged with capital murder in Blanchard's death, Hughes said, adding that the state plans to seek the death penalty.

Yazeed was seen on surveillance video inside the convenience store at the same time as Blanchard, and a witness outside the store saw him force Blanchard into her her black 2017 Honda CRV, according to charging documents.

He was arrested on Nov. 7 in Escambia County, Florida, and was initially charged with kidnapping in the first degree, a designation that includes the intent to inflict physical injury.
Blanchard's remains were found in a wooded area in Macon County, Alabama, about 40 miles east of the convenience store, on Nov. 25. Her car, which had blood evidence ""indicative of someone suffering a life-threatening injury,"" was found abandoned at an apartment complex in Montgomery, Alabama, about 50 miles away from the convenience store. The blood was later determined to be Blanchard's.
Two other people have been arrested in Blanchard's disappearance.
Antwain ""Squirmy"" Fisher, 35, was arrested on Nov. 22 and charged with first-degree kidnapping. He is accused of ""providing transportation to Yazeed, and disposing of evidence,"" according to a charging affidavit.

David Johnson Jr. was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, on Nov. 25 and charged with hindering the prosecution in Blanchard's disappearance. Yazeed was allegedly at Johnson Jr.'s home Nov. 7 before he left for Florida, ABC Birmingham affiliate WBMA reported, citing court documents. Authorities allege that Johnson Jr. knew that Yazeed was wanted by police at the time.
Yazeed is the ""lone person"" responsible in Blanchard's murder, Hughes said, promising that while justice for Blanchard would ""not be swift,"" it would ""be thorough.""

""This case has absolutely shaken this community to its core, he said.
Harris took to Instagram last week to describe the ""unbearable"" pain he felt after losing his stepdaughter.

""Right now nothing makes sense and I’m so lost,"" Harris wrote. ""I just want you back."""
Passenger stung by scorpion on United flight,https://abcnews.go.com/US/passenger-stung-scorpion-united-flight-san-francisco-atlanta/story?id=67580260,"
A passenger aboard a United Airlines flight was treated upon landing after being stung on the plane, according to the airline.

The passenger was traveling on flight 1554 from San Francisco to Atlanta on Thursday, United spokeswoman Natalie Noonan said in a statement. The flight crew consulted with a MedLink physician on the ground to provide medical guidance while still in the air, and the passenger was transported to a local hospital upon landing in Atlanta, Noonan said.
A scorpion was responsible for the sting, TMZ reported -- and included a photo of the offending arachnid.
The woman was stung after the scorpion crawled up her pant leg, TMZ reported. It was later caught by flight attendants, according to the outlet.
It is unclear how the scorpion got onto the plane, which had flown in from Washington, D.C. earlier that day, according to online flight records.
The airline has been in contact with the passenger ""to ensure her well-being,"" Noonan said.
In 2017, a passenger was stung by a scorpion on a United Flight from Houston to Calgary. The sting was not life-threatening, physicians concluded. "
Student in shooting 'tired of being picked on'',https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/student-accused-shooting-tired-picked-67609344,"
A Wisconsin teenager who was shot by a police officer after he allegedly pointed a pellet gun at another student's head says he was “tired of being picked on,"" according to criminal charges filed Monday,
Tyrone Smith, 18, was charged as an adult with several charges, including second-degree recklessly endangering safety,' obstructing an officer, disorderly conduct and dangerous weapons on school premises. 
Smith was 17 when authorities say he         pointed the pellet gun at another student's head at Waukesha South High School last week. A school resource officer helped clear students out of the classroom. A Waukesha police officer entered the room and shot Smith. Police say Smith pointed the gun at officers.
According to the complaint, Waukesha Police Officer Brady Esser, an 11-year veteran, told Smith: “I need you to take your hands out of your pockets very slowly with nothing in your hands, OK man?"" Esser fired three shots, striking Smith. No other shots were fired.
Esser told a detective he had ordered Smith to remove his hands slowly from his sweatshirt pocket with nothing in his hands, but Smith removed his hands quickly and had a gun in his hands, according to the complaint.
“Sgt. Esser stated he feared for his life and was forced to shoot,"" the complaint said.
According to the complaint, Smith denied bringing guns to school before that day and told investigators he was “tired of being picked on by other students."" Smith said he wanted to scare students who had picked on him — or might pick on him in the future — and that “other kids would hear about this and be scared,"" the complaint said.
“Smith concluded by saying that he was sorry, and he knew it was wrong to bring a gun to school and he would not do it again,” the complaint said.
Smith is eligible for a public defender, and an attorney has not been appointed for him yet. He is due back in court Dec. 17.
The day after the Waukesha school shooting, Oshkosh West High School Resource Officer Mike Wissink shot and wounded a 16-year-old student Dec. 3         after the boy stabbed him in his office. Wissink was released from the hospital on Monday and received a police escort to the school, where WLUK-TV         reports he was met with cheers from students and residents. No charges have been filed in that case."
Saudi gunman tweeted against US before shooting,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/saudi-gunman-tweeted-us-naval-base-shooting-67599774,"
The Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola naval base had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast U.S. support of Israel and accuse America of being anti-Muslim, a U.S. official said Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption the attack was an act of terrorism.
Investigators are also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.
Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy during the rampage at a classroom building Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign militaries routinely receive instruction.
“We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,” said Rachel J. Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s office in Jacksonville.
Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the U.S. under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Also, investigators believe the gunman visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting and are working to determine the purpose of the trip, the official said.
All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi commanding officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.
“There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation,"" Rojas said. “The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the investigation was proceeding under “the presumption that this was an act of terrorism""and he called for better vetting of foreigners allowed into the U.S. for training on American bases.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon, DeSantis also said the gunman had a social media trail and a “deep-seated hatred of the United States.” 
He said he thought such an attack could have been prevented with better vetting.
“You have to take precautions"" to protect the nation, DeSantis said.
“To have this individual be able to take out three of our sailors, to me that’s unacceptable,"" the governor added.
Earlier in the week of the shooting, Alshamrani hosted a dinner party where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, another U.S. official told the AP on Saturday.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm weapon that had been purchased legally in Florida, Rojas said. DeSantis questioned whether foreigners should continue to be allowed under federal law to buy guns in the U.S. and called it a “federal loophole.”
Republican DeSantis said he supports that the Second Amendment but that it ""does not apply to Saudi Arabians.” 
Family members and others identified         the three dead  as Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
In a statement, the FBI confirmed Sunday that it had obtained base surveillance videos as well as cellphone footage taken by a bystander outside the building, and had also interviewed that person.
Rojas would not directly answer when asked whether other students knew about the attack beforehand or whether there was anything ""nefarious"" about the making of the video. She said that a lot of information needs to be confirmed by investigators and that she did not want to contribute to “misinformation” circulating about the case.
Rojas said federal authorities are focused on questioning the gunman's friends, classmates and other associates. ""Our main goal is to confirm if he acted alone or was he part of a larger network,"" she said.
President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said on CBS' “”Face the Nation"" that the shooting looked like “terrorism or akin to terrorism."" But he cautioned that the FBI was still investigating.
“Look, to me it appears to be a terrorist attack,"" he said. “I don't want prejudge the investigation, but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized."" O'Brien said he did not see evidence so far of a “broader plot.”
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. More than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.
Foreigners allowed into the U.S. for military training are subject to background checks to weed out security risks.
“This has been done for many decades,” Trump said on Saturday. “I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately.""
Saudi Arabia’s government so far has not commented on a possible motive for the shooting, nor offered any information about the promised investigation.
Meanwhile, the daily Saudi newspaper Okaz published an interview with Othman Alshamrani, a man it described as an extended family member of the shooting suspect from his hometown in the kingdom’s Asir province. “This individual act does not represent us, nor his family nor his tribe,” the relative said, adding that the slain man was from a family with members who have well served their nation in military posts.

"Shooting at Pensacola air base was likely 'terror'-inspired, sources say",https://abcnews.go.com/US/shooting-pensacola-air-base-terror-attack-inspired-radical/story?id=67686374,"
Federal investigators have determined that the shooting at a Florida air base that killed three people was likely a ""terror"" attack inspired by radical Islamic ideology, three sources briefed on the ongoing investigation told ABC News.

On Dec. 6, Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force, allegedly opened fire inside a classroom at Air Base Pensacola, killing three U.S. Navy personnel and injuring another eight people. Alshamrani was shot and killed by Escambia County Sheriff's deputies at the scene.
Alshamrani was in the United States for flight training and purchased the Glock 9 mm pistol he used in the attack about four months ago by taking advantage of a federal gun exception that allows foreign nationals to legally purchase weapons for hunting, authorities said.
Alshamrani allegedly followed radical Islamist content online, including sermons by the American-born cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in 2011 in a CIA-led drone strike.
Alshamrani traveled to New York city shortly before the attack, authorities said, but the travel was likely related to his training and not an effort by him to seek out potential targets.
The U.S. Department of Defense has since suspended operational training for all Saudi students in the wake of the shooting.
The FBI has not officially designated the shooting as a terror attack, saying only that it is being investigated with the ""presumption"" that it was an act of terror.
Federal investigators are also probing a report that Alshamrani watched mass-shooting videos in the presence of some friends in the days leading up to the attack, two sources briefed on the probe told ABC News.

1. NATO's 70th

President Donald Trump is in London for meetings with America's NATO allies to commemorate the military alliance's 70th anniversary as House Democrats move at full speed in the impeachment inquiry.

Before departing for the trip, Trump told reporters the White House wouldn't participate in the House Judiciary Committee's public hearing on Wednesday and blasted Democrats for the timing ""because the whole thing is a hoax.""Just landed in the United Kingdom, heading to London for NATO meetings tomorrow. Prior to landing I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn’t even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?

2. 'What's left of this case?'

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in its first gun rights case in nearly a decade on Monday regarding a challenge to a New York City law that has since been rescinded.

Some of the justices questioned whether there was still a case at all, according to ABC News Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer: ""Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was just last month hospitalized for several days, was back leading the charge, asked the first question out of the gate, said, 'What's left of this case?'""
3. Chicago top cop out

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired retiring Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Monday, citing ""conduct that is not only unbecoming but demonstrated a series of ethical lapses and flawed decision-making.""

She said her decision came after reviewing video evidence and an internal investigation into the night Johnson was found asleep behind the wheel of his parked vehicle at a stop sign one weeknight in October.

Johnson originally blamed problems with his medication, but he later admitted to having ""a couple of drinks"" before he was discovered by officers. Lightfoot said Monday that he ""intentionally lied to me several times"" about the narrative. Johnson had not commented on his dismissal as of Monday night.

""There was clearly something in that video or in that inspector general's report that showed to her that he was no longer the guy for the job,"" ABC News' Ryan Burrow in Chicago tells the podcast.

Missing 1-year-old girl may be endangered after 'suspicious' death in her home,https://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-year-girl-endangered-amid-suspicious-death-home/story?id=67465872,"
A 1-year-old girl is missing and Connecticut authorities fear she may be endangered.

Venessa Morales, 1, was living inside a home where a relative of hers was found dead on Monday night, Ansonia Police Lt. Patrick Lynch told ABC News in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

Local police said in a press release that there is ""an active suspicious death investigation"" in the Ansonia home where Venessa lived.
Police said that while Venessa was not in the home, ""we have not been able to locate her"" since the body was discovered. The FBI is also assisting in the search for the girl.

Authorities were initially called to the house for a welfare check after family members had not been able to contact the Morales family for a couple of days and ""were concerned,"" Lynch said.
Officers arrived at the home before 8 p.m. and found evidence outside that prompted them to force entry, according to authorities.

It was then that they said they found a victim. Authorities would not say how the victim is related to Venessa.

Family members told police the little girl ""was always at the house,"" Lynch said.

Authorities are interviewing Venessa's father as well as family members from both her dad and mom's side, according to Lynch.

Police told ABC New Haven affiliate WTNH that the girl's father is cooperating with authorities.

Authorities are waiting for the medical examiner to determine the official cause and manner of death into the victim.
Ansonia is located about 10 miles west of New Haven.

Venessa has brown hair and brown eyes, police said.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Ansonia Police Department at 203-735-1885.

"Kidnapped 3-year-old found dead was given meth, sedative, autopsy shows: Prosecutor",https://abcnews.go.com/US/kamille-cupcake-mckinney-meth-sedative-murdered-prosecutor/story?id=67655107,"
An autopsy found that the body of Kamille ""Cupcake"" McKinney, the 3-year-old Alabama girl who was found dead in a dumpster after she was kidnapped from a birthday party, was given methamphetamine and a sedative before she was murdered, according to reports.

Prosecutors stated Tuesday during a preliminary hearing for Patrick Stallworth, 39, that he and his girlfriend, Derick Brown, 29, used candy to lure Kamille away from the birthday party on Oct. 12 and kidnap her, ABC Birmingham affiliate WBMA reported.

Birmingham Police detective Jonathan Ross testified that he spoke to a 10-year-old at the birthday party who said he saw a man and woman in an SUV handing out candy and that he saw Kamille in the SUV crying, according to WBMA.
A middle school-aged girl also told Ross that earlier in the day the couple had offered her candy while she was leaving her cheerleading practice, he said at the hearing.

Surveillance video from a nearby gas station allegedly shows Stallworth getting out of an SUV and buying $18 worth of candy, Ross testified. Stallworth allegedly later bought an energy drink and a pill for sexual dysfunction at another gas station, Ross reportedly said.
After he was identified, Stallworth allegedly admitted to coming in contact with the cheerleader and handing out candy to children in the vicinity of the birthday party, but he did not mention anything about Kamille, Ross reportedly said.

Investigators also allegedly found child pornography on Stallworth's cellphone, Ross testified. The dumpster where Kamille's body was later found was located near Stallworth's apartment complex, Ross reportedly said.

After Stallworth was arrested, he allegedly told Ross that he first saw Kamille with Brown when he arrived home to their apartment and that the two were sitting on the sofa and watching television.
According to WBMA, Ross testified that Stallworth said Brown wanted to ""keep her"" and then instructed him to sexually assault her. Stallworth then went outside to smoke a cigarette and accused Brown of putting her hand over Kamille's nose and mouth to kill her, Ross said.

Ross believes that the couple gave Kamille meth and another sedative to make her sleepy, according to the WBMA's report of the hearing. The sedative that was allegedly used, Trazodone, is an anti-depressant used to treat insomnia, and the levels of both drugs in Kamille's system indicated that she ingested them and was not just exposed to them, AL.com reported.
Kamille's family was in the courtroom during the hearing, according to AL.com.

The medical examiner ruled Kamille's cause of death as asphyxiation, prosecutors revealed in the couple's Oct. 25 arraignment hearing. Prosecutors said during Tuesday's hearing that they couldn't determine whether sexual abuse happened due to decomposition of her body, according to WMBA. Ross reportedly testified that a plastic mattress cover found in the apartment had a blood stain and DNA from Stallworth, Brown and Kamille.
Stallworth and Brown are both charged with capital murder of a victim less than 14 years old. Brown is expected to appear in court on Friday.

Stallworth's defense attorneys argued during court that the witness accounts were inconsistent and Stallworth was not with Brown for a portion of the day of the birthday party, according to WBMA. The attorney also said that the reason why Stallworth's phone pinged to the area is because Brown had it with her in the SUV, since hers was broken.

A judge ruled Tuesday that there was enough evidence to send the case against Stallworth to a grand jury, The Associated Press reported.

Stallworth's attorney, Derrick Collins, declined to offer a statement to ABC News, citing a court-ordered gag order.

The Jefferson County District Attorney's office and a public defender for Brown did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Christmas tree farm gives customers 'bit of magic',https://abcnews.go.com/US/familys-christmas-tree-farm-offers-customers-bit-magic/story?id=67698711,"
It’s that time of year again and with just two weeks left, you probably have your Christmas tree up and decorated -- or maybe you don't and are still looking.

Enter Holiday Tree Farms in Corvallis, Oregon, one of the largest Christmas tree farms in the world.
It's been owned and operated by the Schudel family since 1955, first founded by Hal Schudel and now run by his sons John and Steve.
""There's a little bit of horticulture, a little bit of agriculture and a little bit of magic that goes into the whole thing,"" nursery manager Scott Godwin told ABC News recently.

Godwin has been in the nursery for five years, helping his team grow the next generation of Christmas trees.
""It's a really great feeling that each one of these [trees] were handled by hand by hundreds of people over the course of about 10 years before it's delivered to its final customer,"" he said. ""Of course, it's my favorite time of year. It's Christmas!""

John Schudel said that when his father Hal started the business, he was harvesting around 30,000 to 40,000 trees yearly.
""Today, we are shipping approximately 1 million trees per year,"" he said proudly.

The one million trees are planted across 7,500 acres and the process takes up to 900 employees, as well as a few helicopters, to get some of the heaviest trees to the truck.
""It takes a lot of people that are very committed, working 24/7...to cut the trees, load trucks…to get them where they need to be at the right time and in the right condition to make it an incredible experience for our customers,"" said worker Jeff Larcam, part of the third generation of the Schudel family.There's a little bit of horticulture, a little bit of agriculture and a little bit of magic that goes into the whole thing.
Once the trees are cut, they are wrapped and sent to a warehouse in Los Angeles where they are then distributed to tree stands and farms everywhere.
""Just doing this for Christmas, once you do it for the first year, it's in your blood,"" said Alias Lopez, who has been working at the warehouse for 28 years. ""The scent of the Christmas trees, once they're in Los Angeles, everybody knows we're in town.""

Lindsey George was recently shopping with her family for a tree 90 miles south in Fallbrook, California, at Vineyard 1924, where Santa was also visiting children and checking lists twice.

""You wait all year for your Christmas tree and it’s nice knowing that people care so deeply about their own farm and what they’re doing,"" George told ABC News. ""And we get the opportunity to bring it into our home.""

""We decided to go all natural, U.S.A.-grown trees."" said Rob Godwin, who was also tree shopping with his family. ""Best there is!"""
"4 dead in shooting at naval base; suspect was in Saudi Air Force, police say",https://abcnews.go.com/US/active-shooter-naval-base-pensacola/story?id=67542409,"
Four people are dead including the suspect after an active shooting incident at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, police said.

The shooter was identified as Mohammed Alshamrani, a Saudi national and member of the country's air force who was in the U.S. for flight training, law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told ABC News. Investigators are trying to determine whether the shooting was terror-related, the officials said.

Authorities responded to reports of a shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola at 6:51 a.m. on Friday, officials said. ATF and FBI also responded to the scene.

The shooting took place at one of the classroom buildings on the base, officials said. Officers with the Escambia County Sheriff's Office arrived on the scene and fatally shot the suspect after exchanging gunfire.
Three people, including the shooter, were pronounced dead on scene, police said. One victim was taken to the hospital and died from injuries.

Eight others injured in the shooting were transported to Baptist Hospital, police said. The condition of those victims has not been released.
""Walking through the crime scene was like being on the set of a movie,"" Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told reporters earlier in the day, adding, ""The threat has been negated, our community is secured at this time.""

None of the victims have been identified.

In a later interview with ABC News' Eva Pilgrim, Morgan confirmed the suspect used a semi-automatic handgun with an extended magazine.

Morgan described a ""war zone,"" a crime scene that could ""days to process.""

At the scene, ""a tremendous number of rounds fired,"" he added. ""Crime scene was littered with rounds.""

Two officers were among those wounded in the shooting. One officer was shot in the leg and is currently in surgery. The second officer was shot in the arm and is undergoing care at the hospital. They are both expected to survive.

They're ""doing great,"" Morgan told ABC News. ""Expect one to be released today. The other one will be in the hospital for awhile.""
""There's some real heroism today,"" said Capt. Timothy Kinsella, commanding officer at NAS Pensacola.#UPDATE: Shooter and three victims confirmed deceased with multiple others injured and being treated at local hospitals. NAS Pensacola remains in lockdown.

""This is a dark day for a very great place,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""It not only strikes at the heart of the community of northwest Florida but throughout the Navy.""

The FBI is leading the investigation with local authorities and ATF assisting, officials said. The U.S. Attorney's Office is also involved.
According to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation, authorities are urgently focused on two likely possible motives: whether the shooter had religious or ideological reasons; or was there a problem or hostility that developed in the course of the training at Pensacola.
""Base security and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are currently investigating.  The names of the victims will not be released until the next of kin have been notified,"" the Navy said in a statement.

A handgun was identified as the weapon used by the suspect. Only security forces are allowed to carry weapons on the base, Kinsella said.

The shooter was part of an international training service where officers from partner nations are brought to NAS Pensacola to train, Kinsella said, adding that the suspect was part of the ""aviation pipeline.""
The base is shut down until further notice, according to Kinsella.

Mental health coordinators have been sent to talk to witnesses and the victims' families, DeSantis said. The Department of Children and Family Services has sent a mobile response team to the area.

NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. The facility includes the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Marine Aviation Training Support Group 21 and 23, the Blue Angels, and the headquarters for Naval Education Training Command.
During his roundtable on small business and red tape reduction accomplishments on Friday, President Donald Trump sent his condolences to families of the ""warriors"" killed and spoke about his call with the King of Saudi Arabia.

""I can tell you it's a horrible thing that took place and we're getting to the bottom on it,"" Trump said. ""All of the investigators are there now and they're studying it very closely and terrible thing, and our condolences to the families.""

The president also echoed what he said in his previous tweet about his call with the King of Saudi Arabia.

""The king said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shoots and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people so much,"" Trump said.
This is the second shooting incident on a Navy base in the last week.

A 22-year-old active-duty sailor opened fire on three civilian employees, killing two, before he fatally shot himself at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard near Honolulu on Wednesday, military officials said.
The suspected shooter opened fire on shipyard personnel with his M4 service rifle and then used his M9 service pistol to shoot himself, officials said.

Slain UPS driver honored with nationwide moment of silence,https://abcnews.go.com/US/slain-florida-ups-driver-honored-nationwide-moment-silence/story?id=67604772,"
UPS workers around the country were asked to pause for a moment of silence on their routes Monday to honor fellow driver Frank Ordonez, who was taken hostage and killed last week in a police shootout.

Teamsters Local 769, Ordonez’s UPS union chapter, asked drivers to participate in the moment of silence in a tweet on Sunday, sharing an image of the slain 27-year-old in his uniform along with the time and date of the planned nationwide event.
""If in a safe place to do so, UPS drivers across the nation will have a moment of silence with four-way flashers on while parked,"" the union said. ""#RIPFrank If you are able to safely participate in the planned moment of silence tomorrow at 5pm EST, do it for #FRANK.""
UPS said the moment of silence was not a ""coordinated company-wide effort,"" but said workers could ""honor this moment"" as long as it is safe to do so.
Ordonez was killed last Thursday after being held hostage at the scene of an attempted robbery at Regent Jewelers in Coral Gables, Florida. Police said two suspects opened fired while fleeing the store and carjacked Ordonez’s UPS truck before leading authorities on a high-speed chase.
Ordonez and Richard Cutshaw, another bystander, were both killed in the shootout along with suspects Lamar Alexander, 41, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, according to the FBI.

“We are deeply saddened to learn a UPS service provider was a victim of this senseless act of violence,"" UPS said in a statement Thursday. ""We extend our condolences to the family and friends of our employee and the other innocent victims involved in this incident.""

Ordonez began working with the company in July 2016, first as a package handler and then as a driver.

Police sergeant struck and killed by a fugitive driver during traffic stop,https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-police-sergeant-killed-suspect-strikes-vehicle/story?id=67646640,"
The mayor of Nassau Bay, Texas, is calling it a ""nightmare scenario"" after a police sergeant was killed Tuesday night when a suspect she was trying to arrest struck her with his vehicle.

Sgt. Kaila Sullivan was one of several officers performing a traffic stop on a vehicle at an apartment complex in Nassau Bay, southeast of Houston, police said.
When officers determined that the suspect -- identified as Tavores Dewayne Henderson -- was wanted on a warrant for assaulting a family member, they moved to arrest him.
Henderson, 21, allegedly began fighting with the officers, broke free and got back into his vehicle, said Nassau Bay police Chief Tim Cromie at a Tuesday night press conference.

The alleged hit-and-run driver mowed down Sullivan, Cromie said.

As of Wednesday morning, Henderson allegedly abandoned his car and remains on the lam, said Sgt. Dennis Wolfford with the Harris County Sheriff's Office, which is leading the investigation.

The 16-year veteran officer was taken by ambulance to HCA Clear Lake Hospital, where she died from her injuries. She was 43.
""This a nightmare scenario for our city,"" said Nassau Bay Mayor Mark Denman, who said it was the first time a Nassau Bay officer had ever been seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. ""We're a very safe city and I know we'll catch the suspect.""
Sullivan was the fourteenth law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in Texas this year. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Texas leads states with the most law enforcement officers killed in the line-of-duty.

Three days prior to Sullivan's death, Sgt. Christopher Brewster with the Houston Police Department was shot and killed during a domestic assault. Arturo Solis, 25, was arrested and charged with capital murder of a police officer.

George Zimmerman sues victim's family for $100M,https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-files-100m-lawsuit-trayvon-martins-family/story?id=67496989,"
George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and his lawyer have filed a $100 million lawsuit against prosecutors, Martin's family, their attorney and a book publisher for allegations that one of the trial's key witnesses was ""an imposter.""

Zimmerman's civil attorney Larry Klayman filed the multi-million lawsuit in Polk County Circuit Court in Florida.

Klayman alleges in the 36-page lawsuit that Martin's parents Sybrina Ford and Tracy Martin as well as their attorney Ben Crump falsely inserted Rachel Jeantel into the case after the Sanford Police Department closed the investigation in March 2012 as ""self-defense.""
The lawsuit claims then 18-year-old Jeantel was ""an imposter and fake witness"" and the catalyst to get Zimmerman arrested and charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was cleared of all charges after the weeks-long televised trial.

""Defendants, each and every one of them, as individuals and through their employment and agencies, have worked in concert to deprive Zimmerman of his constitutional and other related legal rights,"" according to the lawsuit.
Trayvon Martin was walking back to his father's house on Feb. 26, 2012, after purchasing Skittles and a beverage from a nearby 7-Eleven. The now 36-year-old Zimmerman, who is half white and Hispanic, testified at the murder trial that he was suspicious of 17-year-old Martin, who was walking in the Twin Lakes community wearing a hoodie and talking on a cellphone. Trayvon Martin was unarmed.
Klayman, who founded the nonprofit watchdog organization Judicial Watch, alleges that Jeantel's half-sister Brittany Diamond Eugene was actually on the phone during the deadly encounter and later ""coached"" Jeantel on how to testify, according to the lawsuit. He said these allegations partly stem from newly discovered evidence in the upcoming film ""The Trayvon Hoax: Unmasking the Witness Fraud that Divided America"" from director Joel Gilbert.
Crump responded to the lawsuit in a statement, saying, ""This tale defies all logic, and it’s time to close the door on these baseless imaginings. This plaintiff continues to display a callous disregard for everyone but himself, revictimizing individuals whose lives were shattered by his own misguided actions. He would have us believe that he is the innocent victim of a deep conspiracy, despite the complete lack of any credible evidence to support his outlandish claims.""

He added, “I have every confidence that this unfounded and reckless lawsuit will be revealed for what it is – another failed attempt to defend the indefensible and a shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others.""
Other named defendants in the lawsuit include Eugene, current and former Florida prosecutors Bernie de la Rionda, John Guy, Angela Corey, The State of Florida and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). Klayman alleges that all parties ""either have known about or should have known about the witness fraud, obstructed justice, or lied repeatedly under oath in order to cover up their knowledge of the witness fraud.""

HarperCollins Publishers LLC. was also named as a defendant for publishing Crump's book in October 2019 with defamatory claims against Zimmerman, according to the lawsuit.
FDLE has not been served the lawsuit, a spokesperson told ABC News. Request for comment from the other defendants were not immediately returned.

The Florida Bar criticized Klayman for posting the lawsuit on his website without redacting the addresses of the defendants and other charges, according to the complaint obtained by ABC News. Klayman has not returned ABC News' request for comment.
Since Zimmerman's acquittal, he has attempted to sell the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin, sold confederate artwork to raise money for a supposed ""Muslim free gun store"" and pleaded no contest for threatening and harassing a private investigator who reached out to him to see if he would participate in a film about the 2012 shooting.

Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, became a prominent member of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of her son’s death and has said that her son’s memory lives on as part of the movement along with several unarmed black people who were killed by law enforcement.

"Storm to bring wind and heavy rain to West, snow to Upper Midwest",https://abcnews.go.com/US/storm-bringing-wind-heavy-rain-potential-snow-upper/story?id=67563302,"
A storm has moved into the Western U.S. and it's bringing heavy rain, wind and snow to the region today, before it moves toward the Midwest on Sunday night and early Monday.

There are wind alerts, winter storm warnings, flash flood watches and winter weather advisories issued for parts of California to parts of Montana and Idaho.

As the storm brings widespread precipitation to the West this weekend, it will bring periods of heavy rain to coastal California, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. Between 1- 4” of rain is expected in the San Francisco Bay area, which could cause flooding in areas.
North of the Bay Area, some of the heaviest rain forecasted will fall over recent burn scars, increasing the threat of debris flows and mudslides. This includes areas affected by the Camp Fire, Mendocino Complex Fire, Carr Fire, and Kincade Fire.

Rainfall rates at some of these burn areas could be as high as 0.75” per hour. Additionally, winds could gust up over 40 mph at times, which could lead to power outages in Northern California.
Meanwhile in the Sierra, it will be dangerous to travel this weekend, especially in the mountain passes of I-80. Four feet of snow is expected, making travel extremely difficult. Snowfall rates could be intense at times, especially Saturday night in the Sierra near Reno, where whiteout conditions are possible.

This system will join up with a couple of disturbances to bring some hazardous impacts Sunday night and Monday.  The main concern will be a narrow band of snow that is likely to move into the Upper Midwest, including parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Additionally, heavy rain will move into parts of the Ohio Valley and East Coast.
Up to 6"" of snow is possible in parts of the Upper Midwest through Monday, especially along the border of Wisconsin and Michigan. Snow is likely to impact the morning commute in Minneapolis on Monday.

And more than 2” of rain is coming to parts of the Northeast, which could mean pockets of flash flooding.
However, the most notable impact from this latest storm will be that it opens the door for very cold air to come into the U.S. On Wednesday morning, temperatures will drop dramatically. Wind chills will be as low as -35 in parts of the Midwest, and even down toward Chicago wind chills will be below zero.  It appears right now that Minneapolis will likely not reach above zero degrees on Wednesday.

By Thursday of next week, a large swath of the Central and Eastern U.S. will see temperatures below average.

A Texas sheriff's deputy has been arrested for allegedly conducting illegal strip searches, authorities said.

Bexar County Sheriff's Patrol Deputy Floyd Berry, 49, had been recently placed on administrative duty after several victims ""made outcries"" to the department's internal affairs unit, which prompted an investigation, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. He allegedly conducted the unlawful strip searches on at least six women between Nov. 24 and Dec. 4, authorities said.
Berry has been charged for three counts of official oppression. He was arrested on Saturday around 11 p.m. when he reported for duty at the adult detention center, authorities said.
Following his arrest, Berry was placed on administrative leave and has been served with a proposed termination, according to the sheriff's office. He has been working with the sheriff's office since November 2001 and was transferred to patrol in December 2015.
The sheriff's office internal affairs unit and public integrity unit are conducting separate administrative and criminal investigations into the allegations against Berry.
Authorities are asking anyone who may have been victimized by Berry or have information regarding the investigation to call the sheriff's office. "

368 legal professionals file amicus brief in Supreme Court abortion case,https://abcnews.go.com/US/350-lawyers-legal-professionals-abortions-file-supreme-court/story?id=67441723,"
More than 350 lawyers and legal professionals who had abortions filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court Monday as part of the latest landmark abortion case.

""My hope is that my classmate on the Supreme Court will not want to demonize me,"" Claudia Hammerman, a partner at the prestigious law firm Paul, Weiss, told ABC News. Hammerman is also the lead signer of the brief and a Harvard Law School alumnae. ""I was smart and I deserved my career and I deserved to be able to give it my all and to become a mother when I was fully, emotionally, psychologically, and in terms of resources prepared to become the best mother I could be.""

The legal professionals included attorneys, law professors, public defenders, prosecutors, retired judges, current law students and a senior attorney with the Department of Justice, who joined the brief anonymously and ""on behalf of herself and all the other lawyers working in the highest echelons of government who have had abortions."" Two MacArthur ""Genius"" Fellows are also among those who signed on.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments in June Medical Services vs. Gee, an abortion case out of Louisiana, on March 4, 2020. In question is a Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges with a nearby hospital. A similar law, out of Texas, was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional in 2016.
Amicus -- or ""friends of the court"" -- briefs are filed on behalf of people who are not formally part of a case but who support one side. On Monday, several briefs were filed in the June Medical Services case urging the Supreme Court to strike down the law.

One brief was from the lawyers and legal professionals; another was from about a dozen ""storytellers"" from a variety of backgrounds who have had abortions; one was from abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, the Nationals Abortion Federation, Physicians for Reproductive Health and Abortion Care Network.

The brief from legal professionals reads, ""they would not have been able to realize their personal and/or professional goals were it not for their ability to control their reproductive lives.""

They wanted to put the brief together to show the justices that abortion was not an ""abstract"" concept but something that directly affects the legal community, Alexia Korberg, an associate at Paul, Weiss who worked on it, told ABC News.
A variety of personal stories were told in the brief, ranging from women who had abortions as teenagers to those who had them as mothers facing extreme health risks and fetal diagnoses. Some of the women said they had abortions while in abusive relationships, while others were dealing with depression or addiction when they got pregnant.

""A doctor's appointment years ago is not the most important part of who I am, but it has allowed my life to be everything that it is today,"" one woman, who was accepted to Harvard Law School shortly after getting an abortion, said in the brief.
In addition to the question of hospital admitting privileges -- which the Supreme Court in 2016 deemed an undue burden unnecessary to improve the health outcomes of abortion, a statistically safe procedure when done by medical professionals -- June Medical Services vs. Gee also includes a challenge from Louisiana on the rights of abortion providers and organizations to challenge abortion restrictions on behalf of patients.

Should the Supreme Court rule that providers and organizations do not have the right to represent patients in a third-party capacity, individual women would have to personally challenge laws, potentially putting their names into the spotlight and delaying their access to an abortion.

A number of the women in the amicus briefs explain why they would not have been able to personally challenge laws, including potential stigmas they may have faced personally and professionally.
One woman in the legal professionals brief who ""received her first birth control prescription at the very same Planned Parenthood in front of which she and her family regularly protested,"" said that putting her name on the brief and saying she had an abortion ""will likely cost me my relationship with my mother.""

One woman in the ""storytellers"" brief said she would not have had the resources to sue the state, while another, who had two abortions due to pregnancy complications, said she would not have emotionally been able to handle bringing a lawsuit to obtain an abortion.
For the 2016 case, Whole Woman's Health vs. Hellerstedt, a number of women, including over 110 legal professionals, also participated in filing amicus briefs.

Korberg, who worked on that brief as well, said many of the signers have told her ""how empowering the experience was,"" adding that the response then ""was overwhelmingly positive.""

""It is empowering,"" Hammerman, who also works abortion cases, agreed, ""and I do feel it's absolutely critical that people who can speak about it and normalize do that -- make the roads for others.""

""I would never have been able to help the people I've helped as a lawyer ... had I not been allowed the freedom to determine my own future, by controlling my own body at a pivotal point in my life,"" a former public defender said in the brief filed Monday."
Slain UPS driver's family questions police response to chase,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/slain-ups-drivers-family-questions-police-response-chase-67548020,"
Relatives of a UPS driver killed after robbery suspects took him hostage on a wild police chase across South Florida questioned Friday why officers had to unleash a torrent of gunfire when the truck got stuck in rush-hour traffic.
Both suspects, 41-year-old cousins Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill, were killed along with the driver, Frank Ordonez, and another motorist, 70-year-old Richard Cutshaw, who was waiting at a busy intersection when officers ran up and opened fire from behind the cars of innocent bystanders. 
The chase and final shootout were broadcast live on television, including the moment when one of the men tumbled out of the truck, mortally wounded. 
Ordonez's family said the father of two was filling in on someone else’s route Thursday when the robbery suspects commandeered his truck. 
“I saw on TV when he fell, and I knew it was him. I saw how they killed my brother,” Luis Ordonez told The Associated Press on Friday. 
He said the “police were insane. Instead of talking to them, they just started shooting. I know they (the robbery suspects) were shooting back at them, but it was easy to just cover behind police cars. They could have just covered themselves.""
News helicopters showed first responders tending to the person who fell from the truck, moments after the gunfire ended in Miramar, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the jewelry store robbery.
FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro was asked at a news conference Thursday night whether either the UPS driver or the other victim could've been killed by police bullets. 
“It is very, very early on in the investigation, and it would be completely inappropriate to discuss that,” Piro said. “We have just began to process the crime scene.""
A fundraising appeal by Ordonez’s brother Roy accused the officers of being “trigger happy” and said “they could have killed many more people.”
Multiple agencies were involved in the chase and shootout. But Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak suggested the blame belongs with the robbery suspects. 
“This is what dangerous people do to get away,” Hudak said. “And this is what people will do to avoid capture.”
Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association, said officers confronting the boxed-in UPS truck faced a tough situation. The robbers appeared to be firing at them, endangering not only Ordonez but dozens of people in surrounding cars. He said the officers had to stop the suspects by containing them to the UPS truck and returning fire.
""We have a situation with one hostage and the two suspects -- what happens if one of them runs 10 feet and takes over a city bus with 50 riders? Now we have a situation that is 50 times worse,"" Eells told the AP. Had the truck stopped in an isolated area, officers could have pulled back and negotiated, but not in the middle of a crowded street, he said. 
It all started shortly after 4 p.m. Thursday, when police in Coral Gables received a silent alarm at the Regent Jewelers store in the city's Miracle Mile area. Police said two suspects were at the store and shots were being fired when nearby police arrived, summoned by a silent alarm from inside the store. A store worker was hit in the head by a ricocheting bullet, police said. 
The suspects carjacked Ordonez’s delivery truck, leading officers on a chase into southern Broward County, running red lights and narrowly avoiding crashes. One rear door of the UPS truck was partly open, as well as the driver and passenger-side doors, enabling gunfire along the way. The UPS truck finally stopped in a middle lane at the busy intersection, caught behind a wall of other vehicles waiting for the light to turn green. 
Katherine Gonzalez said officers were in front of her vehicle, a few feet away from the UPS truck, when the shootout started “out of nowhere.""
“It was shocking,"" she said.
Ordonez lived with his mother and stepfather, Joe Merino, after his recent separation from the mother of his 3- and 5-year-old daughters. Merino said Ordonez would buy sneakers for his daughters if he wanted a pair for himself.
“He wanted to match. That’s the kind of father he was,"" Merino said. Ordonez also had recently bought a Christmas inflatable of Santa Claus and his reindeer that his mother wanted but couldn’t get herself and some others of “Toy Story” and “Nightmare Before Christmas” characters so his girls would be surprised.
“He was a really good kid,” Merino said.
Cutshaw  died driving home from his job with a union, the Government Supervisors Association of Florida. Donald Slesnick, an attorney for the union and a former Coral Gables mayor, said Cutshaw was a highly respected negotiator because “he didn't let things become personal battles between himself and management.”
“Rick always had a positive attitude and a smile on his face,"" Slesnick said. He said Cutshaw's only surviving relative is a brother. 
Both suspects had criminal histories: Court records show Alexander was sentenced to probation for a 1996 robbery and 1997 burglary. Five arrests in the 2000s resulted in no convictions before he served a lengthy stretch in prison for a 2008 armed robbery conviction in southwest Florida, gaining his release in 2017.
Florida Department of Corrections records show Hill served time in prison twice: in the 1990s on burglary and robbery convictions and more recently for five burglary-related convictions. 
Naomi Hill, the aunt of both suspects, said Alexander was ""a good boy -- he had changed his life around."" She said he was married with three children and working for a garbage-collection company. 
April Wyche, the sister of Ronnie Hill, said he was the father of two young children, one with special needs, and was working as a driver for a cabinetry company. She said she has no idea why he would have committed the robbery, saying he could have turned to her or their mother for help if needed. She wanted to apologize to the victims' families. 
“No words can express how truly sorry we are,"" Wyche said, weeping. “We are praying for them.”

Alleged cop killer and his mother arrested,https://abcnews.go.com/US/blue-alert-issued-fugitive-allegedly-committed-fatal-hit/story?id=67683624,"
The two-day manhunt for a 21-year-old fatal hit-and-run driver, who allegedly killed a Texas sergeant during a traffic stop, ended on Thursday afternoon without incident.

Moments after Tavores Dewayne Henderson allegedly mowed down Nassau Bay Police Sgt. Kalia Sullivan on Tuesday evening, his mother and her boyfriend took him into hiding, prosecutors said at a press conference on Thursday evening.

Henderson bolted from a traffic stop on Tuesday evening when Sullivan and another officer attempted to arrest him for an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor assault allegedly against a family member. As officers went to make the arrest, Henderson allegedly resisted, got free, went back into the vehicle and drove off, knocking Sullivan to the ground, police said.
Sullivan, a 16-year veteran, was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. She was 43.
A manhunt ensued for Henderson, who was allegedly asleep inside a hotel nearby the 2000 block of San Sebastian Court crime scene, prosecutors said.

Meanwhile, Harris County police officers went to Henderson's mom's home seeking her son's whereabouts and ""she lied,"" prosecutors said.
The mom, who authorities have not identified, was seen on surveillance video -- 30 minutes prior to telling the alleged lie -- dropping off Henderson at the hotel, prosecutors said.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez posted a tweet during the search efforts, warning anyone aiding a fugitive that they will be prosecuted.

""I made it crystal clear that if you are hindering apprehension of a fugitive you will be charged ... we are not playing around with that,"" said Gonzalez at the press conference.

Henderson's mom and her boyfriend were arrested and are charged with hindering prosecution, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said at the press conference. The boyfriend's identity was not released by authorities.

As the search for Henderson continued on Wednesday, a $20,000 reward was offered for his arrest and a ""Blue Alert"" was issued when Henderson was allegedly spotted in Missouri City, Texas, heading to Louisiana with a man identified as ""Anthony.""

The Harris County Police Department announced on social media Thursday that Henderson was ""taken into custody without incident"" from a home on the 4200 block of Heritage Trail Drive in Houston, Texas.Tavores Dewayne Henderson - suspect in the felony murder of Nassau Bay Police Sgt.

""His demeanor was cooperative. We had no problems with him as we got him in to custody,"" police said.

Ogg said that Henderson is being charged with capital murder.

Henderson allegedly made a full confession to police on Thursday and could not explain why he did not stop the car when Sullivan was ""hanging partially out,"" police said.

The Nassau Bay Police Department mourned their fallen officer at a candlelight vigil on Wednesday evening, local affiliate ABC13 reported. Sullivan was a resident of Friendswood, Texas, and  the national president of the Sisters Eternal Woman's Motorcycle Club of Texas.

16-year-old stabs school officer who then shoots student in response: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/armed-student-confronts-resource-officer-wisconsin-high-school/story?id=67463315,"
A 16-year-old student allegedly stabbed a school resource officer at a Wisconsin high school Tuesday morning and the officer shot the student in response, according to local police.

Both the student and officer were hospitalized after the incident at Oshkosh West High School, the Oshkosh Police Department said.

Their injuries are believed to be non-life threatening, Oshkosh Chief of Police Dean Smith said at a news conference.
No other students were injured at the school in Oshkosh, about 90 miles north of Milwaukee, said police.

The stabbing and subsequent shooting stemmed from an ""altercation"" between the officer and 16-year-old at the school resource officer's office, Smith said.

The student used an ""edged"" weapon in the stabbing, Smith said, but the chief declined to call the weapon a knife.
The officer shot the student once. The officer called for help at 9:12 a.m. and first responders arrived at the school two minutes later, said Smith.

The high school, which has over 1,600 students, was evacuated and has been deemed safe, said police.
But the Oshkosh police said its officers are investigating ""a comment that was made on social media implying a possible threat"" toward another school in the area -- Oshkosh North High School, the department said in a statement.

""A comment was written on the Oshkosh Police Department’s Facebook page under the post about the officer involved shooting that occurred at Oshkosh West [High School],"" the police department said.

Police said they do not believe students are in further danger and ""that this comment was not meant to be a threat against Oshkosh North High school.""

In the wake of the officer-involved shooting, classes were canceled for Wednesday throughout the Oshkosh Area School District, said Superintendent Vicki Cartright.
On Monday, about 80 miles away from Oshkosh, a student brought two pellet guns to Waukesha South High School in Waukesha, Wisconsin, according to police.

The 17-year-old boy ignored police commands and pointed a gun at an officer, who then shot the teen three times, twice in the arm and once in the leg, said Waukesha police.

The student was hospitalized in stable condition, police said."
Parents sue Royal Caribbean for negligence after 1-year-old girl falls to her death,https://abcnews.go.com/US/parents-sue-royal-caribbean-negligence-year-daughter-falls/story?id=67649567,"
The parents of a 1-year-old girl who fell to her death from the window of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship over the summer is now suing the company for negligence.

Indiana residents Alan Wiegand and Kimberly Schultz-Wiegand filed the civil lawsuit Wednesday morning, accusing Royal Caribbean of playing ""a major role in the death of our child."" Their daughter, Chloe, would have turned 2 this week.

""We should be celebrating with presents and a birthday cake, but instead we are talking about her death,"" Schultz-Wiegand tearfully said, during a press conference announcing the legal action.

ABC News has reached out to the cruise line for comment.
The couple was on vacation with their 18-month-old daughter and her grandparents on the Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas in July. The little girl was in her grandfather's arms, sitting on a wooden railing and looking through a wall of glass near the children's water park area on the vessel's 11th-floor deck. However, unbeknownst to them, the pane of glass directly in front of them was actually a window slid completely open, according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court in Miami.
As Chloe leaned forward to bang on the glass believed to be there, she ""slipped"" from her grandfather's arms and fell through the open pane, according to the complaint. The child plunged approximately 150 feet below onto the pier in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the ship was docked at the time.

""There was not a single, adequate indication that this wall of glass panes was not actually a wall of fixed glass panes,"" the complaint states, ""but instead a wall of glass with glass panes that could actually slide and remain open, as windows.""

Chloe's parents are seeking unspecified damages from Royal Caribbean and are demanding a jury trial. In the lawsuit, they accuse the cruise line of failing to ""provide reasonably safe children entertainment areas,"" faililng ""adequately mark the open windows"" and failing to ""install safety prevention devices on windows.""
The grandfather, Salvatore Anello, has been arrested and charged with negligent homicide in connection with Chloe's death. He was ultimately released on $80,000 bond and appeared in court in Puerto Rico for a preliminary hearing on Nov. 20.

Anello is next due in court on Dec. 17.
Chloe's parents have maintained the cruise line is at fault. Family attorney Michael Winkleman told ABC News that surveillance video of the incident, which prosecutors shared with defense attorneys as discovery evidence last month, supports Anello's assertion that he thought the window was closed.

""These criminal charges are pouring salt on the open wounds of this grieving family,"" Winkleman said in an October interview. ""Clearly, this was a tragic accident and the family's singular goal remains for something like this to never happen again. Had the cruise lines simply followed proper safety guidelines for windows, this accident likely would never have happened.""
Chloe's grandfather spoke briefly at Wednesday's press conference but did not answer questions related to the incident nor the charges filed against him.

""I sit here broken. We all sit here broken,"" Anello told reporters. ""But our family is strong and we will stay strong together.""

Mom of missing girl thinks 'old friend' took her,https://abcnews.go.com/US/mom-missing-year-dulce-maria-alavez-friend/story?id=67566313,"
The mother of a missing 5-year-old girl who vanished from a New Jersey park more than two months ago believes that an ""old friend"" may have her daughter.

In an interview with Dr. Phil, Noema Alavez Perez said the last time she saw the man she was with her 5-year-old daughter, Dulce Maria Alavez.

""He asked me if that was my daughter,"" Perez, 19, said. ""I told him yes.""
She said at one point the friend tried to date her, but she rejected him.
""He just insisted, but I told him no,"" Perez said.

She did not name the man.

Authorities did not comment on the case.

Dulce has been missing since Sept. 16. She was last seen playing with her 3-year-old brother in City Park in Bridgeton.

Authorities have released a sketch of a man they have only described a ""possible witness."" No suspects have been publicly identified.
Perez said she initially thought her daughter was hiding, but after scouring the park realized she was nowhere to be found.

""I didn't want to believe that someone took her,"" she said.

Dr. Phil asked the mom if was involved in Dulce's disappearance -- and if so, whether she sold her or knew who had her.

""No,"" responded Perez.
Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McCrae said in a statement to ABC News that she could not comment on the investigation, but noted that it is ongoing and active.

""We welcome the national attention that Dr. Phil's show brings to the investigation,"" she said. ""We're asking the public to remain vigilant and to report any sightings or information they believe may be helpful to us finding Dulce and/or to us determining who is responsible for her disappearance.""

Police are asking the public with any possible leads to contact Bridgeton Police Department at 856-451-0033."
Girl threatened suicide 2 months before death; school didn't report: Lawsuit,https://abcnews.go.com/US/12-year-girl-threatened-suicide-months-death-school/story?id=67515249,"
A California couple is suing their daughter's school district over claims that the principal and counselor and other unnamed defendants ""failed and refused"" to take action after learning that the 12-year-old had suicidal thoughts about two months before the girl died by suicide.

Dan and Morgan Ocheltree allege that principal Clint Johnson and school counselor Todd Tyler knew about a text message their daughter, Madison, sent to a friend on April 5 that said she was planning her suicide, according to the lawsuit which was obtained by ABC News.

The suit alleges that the two didn't offer proper counseling to her and never made them aware.

According to the suit, Tyler conducted one counseling session with Madison on the day the text message was reported. Tyler had Madison complete a questionnaire and had her return to class, the suit says. There were no further follow-up counseling sessions and no mention of the incident to her parents, according to the suit.
""The parents never had an opportunity to intercept,"" attorney Steven Gurnee told ABC News in a telephone interview on Thursday. ""And a month later, she did exactly what she had said she was gonna do.""

Madison died by suicide on May 24.
Johnson and Tyler were allegedly shown the text message by a concerned teacher.

The school's policy at the time, according to the the lawsuit, was that once officials learned of a student's suicidal intentions, they ""shall then notify the student's parents/guardians as soon as possible.""

""Had they followed their policy, we believe it wouldn't have happened,"" Gurnee said.

Johnson and Tyler did not respond to ABC News for comment.
The school district said in a statement to ABC News that they ""cannot comment publicly on a pending lawsuit.""

""The subject of this lawsuit is a tragedy that shook our community and left parents, teachers, and students grieving and in shock,"" the statement read. ""We join our community in grieving this profound and heartbreaking loss.""

Candace Shirley, another attorney representing the Ocheltrees, said the school has taken ""a very hard-lined position that they just had no duty"" to report the text message.

The school district has also changed their policy to make any reporting to parents ""discretionary"" since Madison's death, Shirley told ABC News.
Gurnee also said that the school has claimed that they weren't mandated to tell Madison's parents.

""We believe the contrary -- not believe, it's well documented in their own policy,"" he said.

The original negligent and wrongful death complaint was filed on Oct. 7, and after the school responded that they didn't have a duty to report, an amended version was filed on Nov. 21 in the Superior Court of California in Sutter County.

Officer tied to ousted police chief scandal probed for possible evidence tampering,https://abcnews.go.com/US/officer-tied-ousted-chicago-police-chief-scandal-probed/story?id=67584816,"
A female Chicago police officer, allegedly seen drinking with then-police superintendent Eddie Johnson before he was found asleep in his vehicle, has been accused of tampering with evidence linked to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

Cynthia Donald is under investigation for allegedly damaging her police-issued mobile phone and removing the SIM card, which stores the cellphone data. The device reportedly had been sought as potential evidence by the city's Office of Inspector General, which is investigating Johnson over the October drinking incident.

Authorities discovered the damage Oct. 20, three days after Chicago police officers found Johnson asleep behind the wheel of his SUV. Donald was required to return the device after being transferred out of the then-superintendent's security detail.

The city's inspector general is now investigating why the phone was returned damaged, according to the police department. Sources with knowledge of the matter told ABC Chicago station WLS Johnson was seen dropping Donald off at Chicago Police Headquarters around two hours before he was found asleep behind the wheel. The department declined to comment on local media reports that claimed the phone had been sought as evidence by the office of city Inspector General Joseph Ferguson.
""I can confirm media reports that we opened an investigation to determine why the phone was returned damaged,"" Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told ABC News in a statement Sunday. ""At this point, we are not making any additional statements as we are awaiting the final report from the Inspector General and cooperating fully with his review.""
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired Johnson on Dec. 2, just weeks before he was scheduled to retire, due to what she called ""ethical lapses."" Johnson said he pulled over because he was feeling light-headed and later fell asleep, but Lightfoot accused him of intentionally misleading city officials and the public in the aftermath.

Lightfoot also said the inspector general's report, which hasn't been released publicly, showed Johnson exhibited ""flawed decision-making.""

""It has become clear that Mr. Johnson engaged in a series of ethical lapses that are intolerable,"" Lightfoot said in a statement last week. ""Mr. Johnson was intentionally dishonest with me and communicated a narrative replete with false statements regarding material aspects of the incident that happened in the early morning hours of October 17.""
""Had I known all the facts at the time,"" she added, ""I would have relieved him of his duties as superintendent then and there.""
An official briefed on the probe into Johnson's conduct told ABC News that during the traffic stop in question, the superintendent showed his police ID when asked to present identification. The officers apparently didn't recognize Johnson immediately. Once the superintendent showed ID, he and the officers exchanged some words, and Johnson said he was OK to drive away. The cops let him, raising questions about why Johnson wasn't given a field sobriety test.

Johnson acknowledged on Tuesday that he made a ""poor decision and had a lapse of judgment"" on that October night, but disputed the mayor's claims that he had intentionally mislead the city.

""I know in my heart that I have always tried to act in a way that is in the best interests of the great city,"" Johnson said in a statement, noting that he had no interest in fighting for his reputation. ""Reputations are not built in a day and not damaged in a day either.""

""I will simply rely on the reputation for integrity that I think I have earned during my long career,"" he added, ""with the faith that we should all be judged by the entirety of our lives and not on what happened on our worst days.""

Sheriff's deputy fired after allegedly face-slamming teen,https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-sheriff-deputy-fired-camera-allegedly-face-slamming/story?id=67686386,"
A deputy sheriff was fired after being seen on cell phone video allegedly slamming a teenage boy's face on the pavement.

Broward County, Florida, Sheriff Gregory Tony announced Wednesday that Christopher Krickovich was terminated for excessive force despite the state's Professional Standards/Human Rights Committee's (PSHRC) recommendation to exonerate him of any wrongdoing for the April 18 incident.
""When my deputies do the right thing, I will always support them and have their back. But I will not stand idly by while anyone violates his or her sworn duty to protect,"" said Tony in a press release. ""Even a singular incident of excessive force by one of our deputies creates distrust between the community and our organization, and that is something I will not allow.""

Krickovich was seen on camera allegedly pepper-spraying and slamming a 15-year-old student's face onto the ground outside of a McDonald's in Tamarac, Florida, during an arrest. Officer Gregory LaCerra was also present and allegedly involved in the violent arrest.

Afterwards, prosecutors claimed, the two officers filed false charges against the teen in order to cover up the attack.
After the video was posted on social media, the pair was variously charged in July 2019 with misdemeanor crimes including battery, falsifying records and conspiracy to falsify records, prosecutors said. A third officer was also charged in the attack but was found not guilty after a jury trial in September 2019 for one count of falsifying records.

Krickovich and LaCerra both have entered not guilty pleas and their criminal cases are ongoing.

Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, previously told the Associated Press that the Tamarac area is a hot spot for after school incidents with students threatening and harassing the mostly elderly clientele. Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.
Pending Tony's investigation -- that included results from PSHRC which ""investigates employment, housing and public accommodations discrimination, ethics, Wage Recovery, Living Wage, and Cone of Silence violations,"" according to their website -- Krickovich and LaCerra were suspended without pay.

""Like most people who watched the video evidence, I was disgusted by the obvious abuse of authority, but it is important for us to follow due process,"" said the sheriff, who made his decision after an internal affairs investigation.

Sue-Ann Robinson, one of the civil attorneys representing the teenager and his family, held a press conference to explain that Krickovich's termination is not a ""win"" -- ""but it's definitely a step in the right direction,"" she said.

""As a society we cannot allow abuse on our most vulnerable. The separation of one of the officers from the Sheriff’s Office for slamming [a 15-year-old's] head into the ground and filing false charges to cover it up -- is a step in the right direction,"" wrote Robinson on her Instagram account Thursday to accompany a clip of the press conference. 
Tony was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January 2019 to an acting role as the head of the department after the former sheriff, Scott Israel, was fired from the post, accused of mishandling the department's response to the February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Once Tony was in his position, he launched further investigations into the Parkland shooting, firing two more deputies in June 2019 for failing to respond to the scene and stop the alleged gunman. "
Couple's Ring camera set up for dog hacked,https://abcnews.go.com/US/couple-stranger-hacked-bedroom-ring-security-camera-set/story?id=67667763,"
A couple in Georgia said they were terrified recently when a stranger hacked into their Ring security camera set up in their bedroom.

The couple, who asked not to be identified, said they'd bought and installed a camera three weeks ago, so they could watch their puppy, Beau, while they were at work.

On Monday night, however, the woman said as she lay in bed after putting the dog in a crate she heard a cough over the camera.

""I see the blue light come on, and so I'm texting my boyfriend saying, you know, 'Why are you watching? We're laying down. We're about to go to sleep.' He's like 'What are you talking about?'"" she told ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta.
Seconds later, she said she heard someone clapping and saying, ""I can see you in the bed! ... Come on! Wake the f--- up!""

""I was terrified. I mean, I literally could not move my body,"" said the woman, who recorded the stranger with her cellphone.
The voice then began talking to the couple's dog. Her boyfriend said the camera was on a dresser and looked down at the cage where the dog slept.

The couple reported the incident to Ring and said they also planned to file a report with the police.

""I just want people to be aware because we got this Ring camera thinking about one thing, which was our dog, watching our puppy,"" she told WSB-TV.
""Ring should have the safety precautions already set in place where you never have to worry about it,"" the woman's boyfriend said.

He told ABC News Wednesday that Ring had told him that his data had likely been stolen.

The couple told the affiliate that they'd checked the settings and learned that their Ring security camera had been hacked on four separate occasions; it was not clear whether it was the same stranger from Monday.

In a statement, Ring said: ""Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously.  While we are still investigating this issue and are taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation, we are able to confirm this incident is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring’s security.

""Due to the fact that customers often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions, bad actors often re-use credentials stolen or leaked from one service on other services. As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords,"" the company also stated.

Man faces capital murder in shooting of police officer,https://abcnews.go.com/US/houston-police-sergeant-fatally-shot-responding-domestic-violence/story?id=67573083,"
A Houston police officer was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence situation on Saturday afternoon.

The officer, identified at Sgt. Christopher Brewster, 32, was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.

The shooting took place after a woman called 911 to say her boyfriend, who was armed with two guns, was assaulting her, according to Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. Brewster responded to the home, but the couple was no longer there. He continued searching for them, finding them in an alley nearby and exited his vehicle. As he was walking towards the female, she pointed in the direction of the suspect, who then immediately fired at Brewster, police said.
Despite being shot multiple times and mortally wounded, Brewster managed to radio the suspect's location and description, leading to his arrest by responding officers.

Brewster was pronounced dead at about 6:30 p.m. local time, less than an hour after responding to the scene. Acevedo initially said Brewster was not wearing a bulletproof vest, but later updated that he was wearing it.
""This is a tough evening,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a press conference outside the hospital Saturday night. ""Every single day our police officers show up, they come to work ... not knowing what they are gonna face. I want to be very mindful of the service Chris gave to the city.""

The alleged shooter was identified by police as Arturo Solis, 25. He has been charged with capital murder of a police officer.

Acevedo said Solis has a criminal history, including assault causing bodily injury of a family member in 2015. A semi-automatic pistol was recovered in the possession of Solis when he was taken into custody. A second weapon allegedly belonging to Solis was also later found.
In addition to the assault charge, to which he pleaded guilty, Solis has been convicted of criminal mischief and harassment and pleaded guilty to evading arrest and burglary of a vehicle -- all since 2014.

The woman who called police was uninjured, police said.
Brewster had served with Houston police since 2010 and was promoted to sergeant just nine months ago. He is survived by his wife, parents and a brother.

""In the days to come, in the years to come, we will honor his service to the city of Houston,"" Turner said.

The incident was caught on body-worn camera, Acevedo said.
He is the 44th officer to be fatally shot this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks information on police line-of-duty deaths.

He's the 13th law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty in Texas this year -- the most of any state.

He is the first Houston Police Department member to die in the line of duty since Sgt. Steve Albert Perez drowned while working during Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Two Harris County sheriff's deputies -- which includes the city of Houston -- died this year: Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, who was shot and killed, and Omar Diaz, who died of a medical emergency while responding to a stabbing incident."

Tufts University announced plans to sever ties with the Sacklers on Thursday, saying it would remove the billionaire family's name from buildings and medical programs due to concerns over their reported role in the opioid crisis.

University officials said the school would end its decades-long relationship with the family that owns OxyContin producer Purdue Pharma, citing concerns from students and staff about ""the negative impact the Sackler name has on them each day.""

""Our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and others have shared with us the negative impact the Sackler name has on them each day, noting the human toll of the opioid epidemic in which members of the Sackler family and their company, Purdue Pharma, are associated,"" school officials said Thursday. ""We are grateful to those who have shared their thoughts with us. It is clear that the Sackler name, with its link to the current health crisis, runs counter to the school's mission.""
Daniel Connolly, an attorney for members of the Sackler family, said they're seeking to have the ""improper decision reversed.""

""Tufts acknowledges their extraordinary decision about removal of the family name from campus is not based on the findings of their report, but rather is based on unproven allegations about the Sackler family and Purdue,"" Connolly said in a statement Thursday. ""We will be seeking to have this improper decision reversed and are currently reviewing all options available to us.""

Purdue is currently facing more than 1,000 lawsuits for alleged deceptive marketing and contributing to the current U.S. opioid crisis. Individual members of the Sackler family who were involved in the businesses are being sued in a small fraction of these cases.
The Massachusetts university, which has held a relationship with the family since the 1980s, announced its decision in a letter co-signed by the board of trustees’ chairman, Peter Dolan, and university President Anthony Monaco.

The school acknowledged the family's many contributions, noting that the Sacklers would be ""part of this institution forever"" and that the university wasn't ""seeking to erase this chapter of Tufts' history.""
""It is part of this institution forever, and we are committed to appropriately recognizing and contextualizing the involvement of family members over the years,"" the letter said. ""In taking these actions, we will more fully enable our university and medical school to move forward in support of their missions and to help the countless individuals and families who have suffered as a result of the opioid crisis.""

The school also announced a $3 million endowment to support to support education, research and programs aimed at addiction treatment prevention.

Watch for praying mantis eggs on Christmas tree,https://abcnews.go.com/US/walnut-shaped-growth-christmas-tree-pinecone/story?id=67690900,"
What looks like a small little pinecone on your Christmas tree may actually be something you don't want in your house.

The state of Ohio put out an interesting warning for the holiday season about potential insects that could be waiting to hatch inside your home.
Erie County wrote on Facebook, ""PSA: If you happen to see a walnut sized/shaped egg mass, on your Christmas tree, don’t fret, clip the branch and put it in your garden. These are 100-200 preying mantis eggs!""

And for those who don't believe it ... a Virginia veterinarian experienced a nightmare last Christmas when dozens of praying mantises roamed her home.
More than 100 praying mantises hatched from an egg case hidden under the branches of the Christmas tree Springfield resident Molly Kreuze bought for the holiday season, ABC Washington D.C. affiliate WJLA reported.

The bugs moved freely through the house, ""crawling on the walls, crawling on the ceilings,"" Kreuze told the station, adding that they gravitated toward light. Video taken by WJLA showed the insects hanging from the ceiling and crawling on the windows.

This year, Kreuze planned on buying a fake one, she told the local station.

So if you haven't taken a close look at your tree, double check behind the bigger ornaments just in case!

3 arrested after baby sold for $2K: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-couple-arrested-infant-sold-2000-police/story?id=67489712,"
Three people in Kentucky were arrested for allegedly buying and selling a months-old baby, police said.

The infant's mother, Maria Domingo-Perez, 31, sold her child to a couple she did not know for $2,000, according to a statement from the Bowling Green Police Department on Tuesday.

Police learned of the exchange after officials at Parker Bennett Curry Elementary School received information about that child was no longer in its home, Officer Ronnie Ward told ABC News in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Ward said that a staff member at the school had been keeping an eye on the family after concerns were raised about the welfare of her five children, including the baby that was allegedly sold.
A motive is unknown at this time.

Domingo-Perez did not have any relationship with the couple prior to selling her child to them, according to Ward.

When Domingo-Perez was confronted by police, she allegedly gave ""conflicting statements"" before telling police she did sell her infant to Pascual Jose Manuel, 45, and Catarina Felipe Jose, 37, authorities said.
All three were charged with selling/purchasing a child for adoption, which is a felony, according to police.
The elementary school declined to comment on the case and directed ABC News to police.

The child, who was born in October, was taken in by Social Services along with Domingo-Perez's four other children, according to police.

Domingo-Perez, Manuel and Jose are all being held at the Warren County Regional Jail on $10,000 cash bond, online records show. "
Jewish deli shooting's lone survivor describes escape,https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-jewish-deli-shooting-lone-survivor-describes-harrowing/story?id=67698070,"
As bullets whizzed by within inches of him, David Lax said he dove to the floor of a Jewish deli in Jersey City, New Jersey, and when two suspected killers dressed in black barged through the door with guns blazing, he thought his life was about to end.

""I'm just thankful that I lived to see another day,"" Lax told ABC News on Thursday, two days after a man and a woman committed what authorities described as an act of domestic terrorism at the Jersey City Kosher Supermarket, fatally shooting three people before police killed them in a hail of gunfire.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said that the suspects were apparently motivated by sentiments of ""anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement"" and targeted the market shortly after killing a Jersey City police detective, Joseph Seals, 39, the married father of five children, in a nearby cemetery.

Lax said he was at the market about 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, picking up some lunch when he suddenly heard ""a lot of big bangs.""
He said it took him a moment to realize the noise was gunfire.

Lax said that when the attack commenced, he was standing near the front door of the store near the salad bar.

""I thought it's over,"" he said of his life. ""I mean, bullets flying all over.""

Investigators identified the shooters as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.
""They came to kill, and they didn’t come to spare anyone,"" Lax said.

Lax and three other people, including two workers and another customer, were inside the store when the attack began. He was the only one to make it out alive.

He said he dove to the floor as the male gunman, Anderson, wielding what authorities described as an AR-15 style rifle, stormed in firing.

""Like everyone, I jumped on the floor,"" Lax said.

As he tried to hide, one of the shooters dressed in a black raincoat walked by him.
He said that as the gunman passed, he stood up only to come face-to-face with the second assailant, Graham, who authorities said was holding a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun.

Lax said that as Graham swung the barrel of the gun toward him, he managed to push the weapon away and made a beeline for the front door.

""I thank God I had the courage, I had the right mind,"" Lax said. ""I just re-directed her arm and ran out of the store.""

He said he ran as fast as he could in a zigzag pattern, dodging the shots being fired at his back.

Lax said that once he made it outside to the street, he encountered a child near a neighboring synagogue.
""He’s very brave, very smart,"" he said of the child, who appeared to be alone. ""We met like on the corner of the street. I was running faster than him, so I passed by him and then I was turning around and I saw him. He started talking to me, so I said, 'You know what, you’re coming with me. So that’s basically it.""

Killed inside the store were 33-year-old Mindy Ferencz, the wife of the kosher supermarket owner and mother of five, and 24-year-old Moshe Deutsch, a Yeshiva student. Also shot dead was Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, who worked at the store.
Lax said that when the shooting started, Ferencz was sitting near the cash register, while Rodriguez was in the back of the store. Authorities described Deutsch as a customer.
Lax said that after he and the child were out of harm's way, police arrived on scene and a massive gunbattle erupted.

Grewal said Thursday that ""several hundred"" shell casings were found at the scene.
Anderson and Graham were both shot to death in an hourslong gunfight with police.

""Obviously, it’s just a miracle ... because as far as I know, it’s hard to miss with a shotgun at such a close range,"" Lax said of surviving the attack. "

Dad dies after falling off roof while hanging Christmas lights with son,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dad-dies-falling-off-roof-hanging-christmas-lights/story?id=67486442,"
A man in Texas has died after he fell off a roof while he was hanging Christmas lights with his son to earn some extra holiday money.

Felipe Gallegos was hanging lights on the roof of a house with his 17-year-old son in Argyle, Texas, last Saturday when his wife who was in the front yard heard a loud noise.

“He was on the roof and then we heard something,” said Gallegos’ widow Alisha Flick to ABC News’ Dallas affiliate station WFAA. “He was lying on the concrete saying ‘help me, help me.’”
Flick called 911 immediately and Gallegos was taken to the emergency room for treatment.

“The CAT scan came back and he had a skull fracture and bleeding in the brain. And then he had a chest fracture and they had to drain blood from his chest. They rushed him into emergency surgery but he didn’t make it,” Flick said tearfully.

A GoFundMe campaign to help support Flick and her 17-year-old son in the aftermath of Gallegos’ death has brought in close to $50,000 from almost 500 donors.
""He always had a smile on his face, and he was always goofy and making everybody laugh,"" a clearly heartbroken Flick told WFAA.

With just a few weeks to go before Christmas Gallegos’ sudden death has left an enormous void for his surviving wife and son.

Said Flick: “It’s hard enough losing somebody when they are sick but at least you know it’s coming. With this, you had no idea.”

College student stabbed to death in NYC: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/18-year-barnard-college-student-tessa-rane-major/story?id=67679789,"
An 18-year-old college student was stabbed to death in New York City, police said.

Tessa Rane Majors, a Barnard College student, was found unconscious with multiple stab wounds near Morningside Park in Upper Manhattan Wednesday evening, police said. She was rushed to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to a statement from the New York City Police Department.
The 18-year-old was walking through the park, right by the campuses of Barnard and Columbia University, when she was engaged by an unknown number of suspects, NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison told reporters at a news conference.

During a struggle, one of the suspects pulled out a knife and stabbed Majors several times, Harrison said. A knife was recovered from the scene, but it is unclear if it is the weapon used in the stabbing.
After Majors pulled herself out of the park, a school public safety officer at his post at 116th Street and Morningside Drive ""came to her aid immediately upon recognizing that she was injured,"" according to a statement from Columbia University, which called reports that the security guard was not at his post ""inaccurate.""

""Officers stationed at this location do not make rounds that cause them to leave their post,"" the statement said.
One to three people are believed to have been involved in the stabbing, and several minors are being questioned, Harrison said.

There have been no arrests so far, police said. The NYPD is increasing patrols near Morningside Park and Columbia University.
A person of interest was being questioned on Thursday in connection with the case but has since been released, according to two police sources.

Majors was a first-year student at Barnard College, a private women's liberal arts college in Manhattan that sits just outside Morningside Park, alongside Columbia University.
Majors' family said in a statement that they ""lost a very special, very talented, and very well-loved young woman.""

""Tess shone bright in this world, and our hearts will never be the same,"" the family said.
The school's president, Sian Leah Beilock, said in a statement that Majors ""was fatally injured during an armed robbery that occurred off campus in Morningside Park.""

""Tessa was just beginning her journey at Barnard and in life,"" Beilock said. ""We mourn this devastating murder of an extraordinary young woman and member of our community. This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the stabbing as ""horrifying"" in a news conference Thursday morning, while NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it an ""absolute tragedy."""

A 29-year-old woman died on Sunday afternoon after getting caught in an avalanche while backcountry skiing in Colorado, officials said.

The skier was completely buried by snow from the avalanche on Diamond Peak near Cameron Pass in northern Colorado's Larimer County.

The avalanche occurred at 11,400 feet and was described as ""2 to 3 feet deep, very wide and running close to 500 feet vertically,"" according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
Other skiers dug her out and called for help. But the woman wasn't breathing, and she was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders, according to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office.
It's the first fatality from an avalanche in the state this season.
The woman, whose name has not yet been released, was from the nearby city of Fort Collins. Her body was recovered from the mountainside, the sheriff's office said.

The cause and manner of her death will be determined by the Larimer County Coroner's Office.

4 guards allegedly watched inmate attempt suicide,https://abcnews.go.com/US/guards-yorks-rikers-island-accused-watching-teen-inmate/story?id=67489717,"
Four correction officers, including a captain, at New York City's Rikers Island jail were suspended and accused of ""extremely troubling"" behavior after they allegedly stood by for seven minutes watching an 18-year-old inmate attempt to hang himself, authorities said.

The inmate tried to take his own life on Thanksgiving Day at the jail's George R. Vierno Center with a piece of clothing as the jailers looked on before intervening, officials said.

""The claims being made here are extremely troubling and we are taking them seriously,"" Cynthia Brann, commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction, said in a statement. ""The safety and well-being of those in our custody is our number one priority and an investigation into this incident is underway. Three officers and one captain have already been suspended and if the outcome of the investigation warrants we will take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination.""

The names of the suspended correction officers were not immediately released.
Brann said the incident, which occurred at about midnight Nov. 28, was referred to the city's Department of Investigation to conduct an independent inquiry.

The teenage inmate, identified by the city's Legal Aid Society as Nicholas Feliciano, was placed at Rikers Island on Nov. 18 after he was arrested on a parole violation.
The 18-year-old attempted suicide shortly after being removed from the general population after getting into a fight, officials said.

Feliciano was in a medically-induced coma Wednesday morning and remains under guard in the intensive care unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, according to the Legal Aid Society, which has assigned a defense attorney to represent him.
The Legal Aid Society said Feliciano has a history of mental health problems and suicide attempts.

""Nicholas’ tragedy illustrates the dangers and horrors of relying on our broken parole and correctional systems to address a mental health crisis,"" the Legal Aid Society said in a statement released on Wednesday. ""Despite his young age and known mental health history of past suicide attempts, Nicholas, who is 18 years old, was remanded to New York City jails – a system with a poor track record of managing suicide risks during incarceration – on allegations that have so far resulted in no criminal charges.""
Feliciano's doctors and the Legal Aid Society's Parole Revocation Defense Unit are calling on the state Department of Correction and Community Supervision to release him from custody due to his critical condition and immediately dismiss the parole violation.

""These constraints have already exacerbated his family’s grief and anxiety around this tragedy,"" the Legal Aid Society's statement reads.
""This outcome underscores the New York City Department of Correction's inability to safeguard the youngest people in its custody,"" the statement reads. ""It represents a colossal failure of supervision and leadership, one for which we demand answers before another New Yorker leaves the New York City jails in critical condition.”
The incident comes about two months after the New York City Council approved a plan to shut down Rikers Island, an 87-year-old, 400-acre lockup in New York City's East River. Rikers is the world's largest jail, housing roughly 7,000 inmates on any given day.

The jail is expected to be shuttered by 2026 and replaced with four smaller jails to be built an at estimated cost of $8 billion closer to the city's main courthouses in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens.

""Rikers Island is a symbol of brutality and inhumanity and it is time for us to once and for all close Rikers Island,"" New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, a Democrat, said after the council voted to close the jail. ""As a city we must do everything we can to move away from the failed policies of mass incarceration."""
Lawsuit slams New York City homeless program,https://abcnews.go.com/US/york-city-dumping-homeless-jersey-live-decrepit-buildings/story?id=67458182,"
A program designed to help curb homelessness in New York City has turned Newark, New Jersey, and surrounding area into a dumping ground for needy families, according to a new lawsuit.

People who had been in shelters are being placed in uninhabitable or illegal apartments, some with no heat or electricity, some with crumbling ceilings and floors, the suit, filed at the behest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, alleges.

The suit, filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accused New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Steven Banks, commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, of orchestrating an ""ill-conceived, surreptitious"" program that's become a public nuisance.
The lawsuit contends New York's Special One-Time Assistance program, or SOTA, has ""unlawfully coerced"" people into leaving the city's shelters for dilapidated, rodent-invested housing in neighboring communities.
Under SOTA, launched by the de Blasio administration in August 2017, the city offers families that have been in shelters for at least 90 days housing subsidies for up a year as long as the heads of households work and earn income for future rental payments.

But participants of the program have said the subsidies are not enough for them to live in New York, so they're being shipped to more affordable communities, where they're virtually abandoned in substandard housing, according to the lawsuit.

While the program requires New York's Department of Homeless Services to conduct walk-throughs of apartments before placing people in them, the lawsuit contends that's rarely happened.
""Defendants have caused a public nuisance that has significantly harmed any considerable number of Newark's residents and the State of New Jersey residents,"" reads the lawsuit.

Newark leaders, who have outlawed SOTA in the city, claim 2,200 families have been placed in 62 New Jersey towns, including 1,198 in Newark.

""New York has continued to send people despite us having several discussions about our problems with their program,"" Newark's corporation counsel, Kenyatta Stewart, told the Newark Star-Ledger. ""We need to get a judge involved so they can stop shipping people to Newark.""
Elizabeth, New Jersey, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said in a statement Tuesday afternoon it was ""strongly considering going forward in joining Newark"" in a possible class-action lawsuit.

Avery Cohen, de Blasio's deputy press secretary, blasted the lawsuit in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday.

""In the face of a regional housing crisis, the City of Newark has inexplicably taken a page from the Trump playbook, building a wall to single out and prevent families from seeking housing where they want to live,"" Cohen's statement reads. ""This is wrong, hypocritical, and amounts to nothing short of income-based discrimination. We will continue to fight to ensure that families have the right to seek stable and safe housing.""
Sha-Kira Jones, one of several SOTA program participants named in the lawsuit, said she never wanted to live in New Jersey. She said she felt pressured to move there after living in a shelter for 10 months with her two young children while pregnant at the time, according to the lawsuit. They ended up in a Newark apartment, where the electricity stopped working and all the food in her refrigerator spoiled.

She claims complaints to her landlord were ignored, and New York City officials refused to intervene, according to the suit. She eventually learned she was living in an illegally converted apartment.
Another SOTA recipient -- whose name was not included in the lawsuit because the individual was ""fearful of future reprisal by the Defendants"" -- claimed in the lawsuit that her apartment was rodent- and roach-infested, the bathroom ceiling collapsed and that the heater never worked.

She said she was forced to leave the apartment when Newark city officials told her the building was being condemned.

Loreal Bell, another SOTA recipient, said she was moved into an apartment in Newark that was mice-infested, had faulty wiring and no heat, according to the suit. She claimed that when she complained to officials at the New York Department of Homeless Services, she was told to contact Newark officials.

""Ms. Bell,"" according to the lawsuit, ""feels like she was 'dumped here and is now a Newark problem.'"""

A police officer has been injured after biting into a sandwich that contained a razor blade in New York City in what police have since called an accident.

The incident occurred on Thursday, Dec. 5 at a Bon Appetit Special Food Store in Belle Harbor, Queens.

The officer, who works for the New York Police Department’s Strategic Response Group, was dressed in plain clothes when he entered the establishment and ordered the sandwich.

As he took a bite of his food he felt a sharp pain in his mouth only to discover that he had chomped down on a razor blade that was located in the sandwich, according to ABC News' New York City station WABC.

The officer was taken to hospital, treated and released.
New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea initially tweeted that the NYPD would investigate the incident and that violence against New York City police officers would not be tolerated.

“The NYPD has ZERO tolerance for acts of violence against our police officers. A sandwich bought at a Queens deli on Thurs. contained a razor blade that cut the inside of a @NYPDCT cop’s mouth. He’ll be OK, but a full investigation into this abhorrent act is underway,” said his initial tweet addressing the razor blade incident.

But after an investigation, the NYPD deemed that the razor blade incident was, in fact, an accident.After a thorough investigation by @NYPDDetectives its been determined that the razor incident was indeed an accident-thankfully our officer or another customer wasn’t seriously injured.

""After a thorough investigation by NYPD Detectives, it's been determined that the razor incident was indeed an accident,"" Shea said on Twitter. ""Thankfully, our officer or another customer wasn't seriously injured. Appropriate agencies have been notified for follow up to ensure this never happens again.""

Bon Appetit issued a statement apologizing to the officer and said that they are undertaking an internal investigation to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.
""First, we would like to extend our deepest apologies to the officer involved in this unfortunate incident,” the statement read. “We use a variety of tools to prepare our food, but none should ever be found in any food item meant for customer consumption … In over 10 years of management in this location, we have never had an incident like this and look forward to providing the highest quality service to all of our customers in the future.""

Woman allegedly denied morning-after pill,https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-denied-morning-pill-pharmacists-beliefs-lawsuit/story?id=67683626,"
A woman in Minnesota is suing two pharmacies, including CVS, for sex discrimination after she claims she was denied a morning-after pill.

Andrea Anderson, a 39-year-old mother of five, said she was first refused the pill at her local pharmacy, Thrifty White Pharmacy in McGregor, according to a lawsuit filed in Minnesota’s Ninth Judicial District on Tuesday.

Anderson called in the prescription and just before she went to pick it up, she received a call from a pharmacist there who told her that he couldn't fill the prescription because of his ""personal beliefs,"" the lawsuit claims.

After complaining to the pharmacy's owner, Anderson claimed she was told that this was not the first time the pharmacist, who also serves as a local pastor, refused a prescription.

Yet her troubles didn't end there, she and her lawyers say.

When she tried a CVS that was located about 25 minutes away, she was allegedly told her prescription couldn't be filled there either.
The pharmacist at the CVS also tried to stop Anderson from obtaining it at a nearby Walgreens by allegedly telling her that they didn't have it in stock, the lawsuit claims.

Yet when Anderson called Walgreens ""to double check,"" she was told that the pharmacy did indeed have Ella and could fill her prescription.
The pharmacist at Walgreens also confirmed to Anderson that she had just spoken with someone at CVS and said as such, according to the lawsuit.

""The pharmacists I encountered ignored my health needs and my doctor's instructions,"" Anderson said in a statement.
""I could not believe this was happening. I was angry,"" she added.

CVS Pharmacy did not respond to ABC News' specific questions, but said in a statement they were ""reviewing and investigating the allegations made in the complaint.""

""CVS Pharmacy is committed to providing access to emergency contraception, whether it is at the pharmacy counter for patients who have a prescription for it, or in our store aisles where we have sold over-the-counter emergency contraception for several years,"" according to the statement.

A manager at the Thrifty White Pharmacy in McGregor told ABC News that the store had not yet been served, but declined to comment further.

Jess Braverman, the Legal Director at Gender Justice, the non-profit representing Anderson, condemned the pharmacist at Thrifty White, saying in a statement to ABC News that he ignored both his legal and ethical obligation.

Braverman hopes that the lawsuit will ""ensure that health care providers uphold their legal and ethical responsibilities to care for their patients, regardless of the providers’ personal beliefs.""

Pre-made sushi and spring rolls makes for a great work day lunch, but after a new recall it may be time to toss the hand roll.

Fuji Food Products, Inc. (Fuji) announced a voluntary recall of ready-to-eat sushi, salads and spring rolls that were sold at retailers in 31 states including Trader Joe's, along the East Coast and Midwest.

The products were also sold at 7 Eleven, Walgreens, Food Lion, Hannaford, Giant Eagle Supermarkets, Porkys, Bozzutos, Supreme Lobster and Superior Foods.

Fuji voluntarily issued a recall after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the company of potential product contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, according to a press release. Public health officials have not yet reported any illness associated with the recalled products.
""As responsible processors of safe, fresh food for nearly 30 years, we are addressing this problem vigorously and we apologize to those who are affected by it,"" Fuji Food Products CEO Farrell Hirsch said in a statement.

Couple says stranger hacked into bedroom Ring camera set up to watch puppy,https://abcnews.go.com/US/couple-stranger-hacked-bedroom-ring-security-camera-set/story?id=67667763,"
A couple in Georgia said they were terrified recently when a stranger hacked into their Ring security camera set up in their bedroom.

The couple, who asked not to be identified, said they'd bought and installed a camera three weeks ago, so they could watch their puppy, Beau, while they were at work.

On Monday night, however, the woman said as she lay in bed after putting the dog in a crate she heard a cough over the camera.

""I see the blue light come on, and so I'm texting my boyfriend saying, you know, 'Why are you watching? We're laying down. We're about to go to sleep.' He's like 'What are you talking about?'"" she told ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta.
Seconds later, she said she heard someone clapping and saying, ""I can see you in the bed! ... Come on! Wake the f--- up!""

""I was terrified. I mean, I literally could not move my body,"" said the woman, who recorded the stranger with her cellphone.
The voice then began talking to the couple's dog. Her boyfriend said the camera was on a dresser and looked down at the cage where the dog slept.

The couple reported the incident to Ring and said they also planned to file a report with the police.

""I just want people to be aware because we got this Ring camera thinking about one thing, which was our dog, watching our puppy,"" she told WSB-TV.
""Ring should have the safety precautions already set in place where you never have to worry about it,"" the woman's boyfriend said.

He told ABC News Wednesday that Ring had told him that his data had likely been stolen.

The couple told the affiliate that they'd checked the settings and learned that their Ring security camera had been hacked on four separate occasions; it was not clear whether it was the same stranger from Monday.

In a statement, Ring said: ""Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously.  While we are still investigating this issue and are taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation, we are able to confirm this incident is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring’s security.

""Due to the fact that customers often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions, bad actors often re-use credentials stolen or leaked from one service on other services. As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords,"" the company also stated.

Backcountry skier killed in Colorado avalanche,https://abcnews.go.com/US/backcountry-skier-killed-avalanche-colorado-officials/story?id=67593046,"
A 29-year-old woman died on Sunday afternoon after getting caught in an avalanche while backcountry skiing in Colorado, officials said.

The skier was completely buried by snow from the avalanche on Diamond Peak near Cameron Pass in northern Colorado's Larimer County.

The avalanche occurred at 11,400 feet and was described as ""2 to 3 feet deep, very wide and running close to 500 feet vertically,"" according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
Other skiers dug her out and called for help. But the woman wasn't breathing, and she was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders, according to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office.
It's the first fatality from an avalanche in the state this season.
The woman, whose name has not yet been released, was from the nearby city of Fort Collins. Her body was recovered from the mountainside, the sheriff's office said.

The cause and manner of her death will be determined by the Larimer County Coroner's Office.

"Woman collects, sends more than 160,000 holiday cards to troops in US, overseas",https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-collects-sends-160000-holiday-cards-troops-us/story?id=67504590,"
With Christmas just three weeks away, Laura Landerman-Garber and her team are hard at work trying to make sure that they bring holiday smiles to U.S. troops overseas and across the nation.

""This is like my Santa's workshop,"" Landerman-Garber said of her home to ABC affiliate WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire.

For 16 years, the Hollis, New Hampshire, woman has been collecting letters -- and care packages -- from across the U.S. and sending them out to the military. At first, she got her family members to send the holiday cards.
Two years ago, she set a goal of 5,000 cards and mailed them out to servicemembers aboard an aircraft carrier.

""We wanna give to our warriors...who are far away from home,"" she said.
Landerman-Garber eventually formed the nonprofit Holiday Cards 4 Our Military -- NH Challenge to help with postage and enlisted family, friends and even neighbors to help with the huge holiday effort.

Many of the letters and notes to the servicemembers begin with ""Dear Warrior"" and include handwritten notes and homemade illustrations from children across the nation. Landerman-Garber even gotten letters from schoolchildren as far away as Hawaii.
In 2019, 50,000 cards were mailed out.

This year, Landerman-Garber's challenge reached all 50 states. She even got cards from some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

On Monday, Landerman-Garber posted to her Facebook group that she had received ""160,000-plus"" holiday cards.
By Wednesday, the cards and holiday candy had begun arriving to troops overseas and in the U.S. The photographs she shared in her Facebook group captured just how special the packages made the servicemembers feel.

Landerman-Garber said it was those photographs and expressions of gratitude that kept her sending cards year after year.

""New Hampshire, we're fierce. ... We're small in size but we're so large in heart,"" she told WMUR-TV."
"Heavy rain, strong winds and snow to hit parts of Western US",https://abcnews.go.com/US/heavy-rain-strong-winds-snow-hit-parts-western/story?id=67577197,"
A storm in the western United States is bringing heavy rain, gusty winds and mountain snow from California to the Rocky Mountains this morning.

Heavy rain from the storm brought flash flooding to San Francisco on Saturday prompting road closures in parts of the city. North of the Bay Area, 5.75 inches of rain was reported in Hobergs, CA.  Gusty winds also downed some trees in the area.

In the Sierra, snow has already accumulated up to 8 inches this morning. Snow totals through Monday could reach as much as 3 to 4 feet. This will cause significant travel delays in the mountain passes.

Heavy rain in northern California will continue to bring the threat for rock slides and landslides today. Additionally, there is a threat for avalanches in parts of the Sierra, especially near the Lake Tahoe Area. There is an avalanche warning in this area through the morning hours of Sunday.
This storm is about to move eastward today, and part of this overall system will emerge from the Rockies late tonight and rapidly change the weather for the central and eastern U.S. over the next few days. Winter Storm warnings remain posted for the Sierra today and winter weather advisories are in effect for parts of the Rockies and upper Midwest.
By tomorrow morning, a new low pressure system will quickly move into the upper Midwest and bring some snow to parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin. The morning commute in those regions could be treacherous with snow falling heavily at times.

Ahead of the low pressure, heavy rain is expected to develop. Especially in parts of the northeast U.S. where snowfall was heavy just 1 week ago, the combination of rapid snow melt and locally heavy rain could bring some localized flooding.

As the storm moves into Canada, the extended cold front will become quite powerful and stretch deep into the southern U.S.
The impacts of this cold front are both in precipitation and in temperature. First, ahead of the cold front, warm mild air will allow temperatures to rapidly rise into the 50s and 60s -- especially on Tuesday.

For parts of the east coast -- especially in the northeast -- that will be a nice welcome. However, the approaching cold front will bring rain, which could be heavy at times and bring 1 to 2 inches of rain, especially in the northeast U.S.

As the cold front passes, temperatures will plummet. It is looking more and more likely that there could be a 20 to 30 degree temperature difference within just a few hundred miles on Tuesday in parts of the southern and eastern U.S. as can be seen between New Orleans, 68 degrees, and Dallas 38 degrees, on Tuesday morning.

In New York it will be in the upper 50’s on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, temperatures will be the upper 20’s and low 30’s.

The global forecast models are now also indicating that a decent amount of precipitation will linger behind the cold front.

This should result in some notable weather drama, with parts of the southern and eastern U.S. going from mild rain to a mix of cold and snow. Even in the northeast U.S., it is now appearing that a burst of snow is likely on Wednesday morning.
The result of this combination of events is locally 1 to 2 or more inches of rain in parts of the eastern U.S. and locally 6 inches of snow in parts of the upper Midwest through Tuesday.

On Tuesday night and into Wednesday, a quick burst of snow could bring a couple of inches to parts of the northeast which could cause problems for the Wednesday morning commute.
Behind this front, the door will open in the Midwest for very cold air with temperatures crashing. Wind chills could go as low as -20 and -30 in parts of the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

The good news is that this cold blast doesn’t look long-lived, and it seems to fall apart to some degrees as it heads to the eastern U.S. late next week.

Two of the three inmates who were captured are murder suspects -- in different cases. The third captured escapee is charged with armed robbery -- a separate case from Caruthers.
ABC News does not normally name juveniles, but are doing so with Caruthers because police said he is are dangerous individual and have released his names and photos.

Man allegedly firebombs car dealership after failing to trade rental car for Mercedes,https://abcnews.go.com/US/canadian-man-allegedly-firebombs-car-dealership-failed-attempt/story?id=67484630,"
After a Canadian man's plan to trade in a rented Ford Fusion for a new Mercedes at a Florida car dealership went up in smoke, he returned hours later and set several cars on fire, police said.

Sanjeev Grewal visited a Mercedes-Benz dealership on NW 167th Street in Miami Gardens on Nov. 29 and told a salesman that he wanted to turn in ""a stolen vehicle"" and finance a new car, according to the police report.

But, when a manager searched the vehicle identification number (VIN), it turned out to be an Enterprise Rent-A-Car that was rented to the 36-year-old back in September from a Las Vegas, Nevada, location.

After the dealership rejected Grewal's potential trade-in, he left without incident -- but not before management photographed him, his vehicle, and his Canadian driver's license, according to the police report.
The photos would soon prove useful, as Grewal allegedly returned to the dealership in the same 2018 Ford at about 3 a.m. on Nov. 30 and hopped the wall surrounding the lot.
Video cameras allegedly caught Grewal pouring what appeared to be liquid on one of the cars in the lot, before lighting an object and throwing it on the ground next to the vehicle, causing it to burst into flames and spread to three other cars.

The damage to the vehicles cost over $300,000 worth of damage, according to investigators with the Miami Gardens Police Department. Grewal then allegedly drove off in his rental vehicle.

The city's fire investigator determined the fire to be an arson, according to the police report.

A few hours later, Miami Beach police were called to investigate an early-morning disturbance at the Design Hotel, where they encountered Grewal. A strong smell of gasoline allegedly fumed in his hotel room and on him.

Police then searched his car, where they discovered several empty beer bottles with paper towel wicks that resembled Molotov cocktails, according to the police report.
Grewal was detained by police and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital for an evaluation.

A Miami-Dade County judge on Monday set $100,000 bond for Grewal, who is charged with felony second-degree arson and criminal mischief, according to online records.

Homeland security requested a detention hold for Grewal for overstaying in the U.S., police said.

Grewal is represented by a public defender and has not entered a plea, according to online records.

If convicted, Grewal faces up to 15 years in prison.

"1-2 punch as pair of storms bring heavy rain, mudslide threat, mountain snow to West",https://abcnews.go.com/US/punch-pair-storms-bring-heavy-rain-mudslide-threat/story?id=67486499,"
A pair of storms will bring a one-two punch to the West starting today.

Storm number one is already moving into California this morning, bringing heavy rain to Los Angeles and San Francisco with snow falling in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Flash flood watches have been issued from Los Angeles to San Diego this morning for heavy rain and a threat of flooding that could create mudslides.
This afternoon and evening, heavy rain will move into Nevada and Northern Arizona with heavy mountain snow from the Sierra Nevada into the Rockies.

Total rainfall could reach 3” of rain in Southern California, and snow could pile up as high as 18” in the Sierra Nevada and 6-12” in the Rockies.
And even though no flood alerts have been issued for the San Francisco Bay area this morning, any additional rain there could create mudslides due to the very saturated ground from last week’s rain.
After this storm is gone, a brand new storm that's even stronger will move into the West Coast Friday into the weekend, with several more inches of rain for Northern California and several feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada range.

A winter storm watch has already been issued for Northern California.

Suspect in naval base shooting was Saudi national,https://abcnews.go.com/US/active-shooter-naval-base-pensacola/story?id=67542409,"
Four people are dead including the suspect after an active shooting incident at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, police said.

The shooter was identified as Mohammed Alshamrani, a Saudi national and member of the country's air force who was in the U.S. for flight training, law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told ABC News. Investigators are trying to determine whether the shooting was terror-related, the officials said.

Authorities responded to reports of a shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola at 6:51 a.m. on Friday, officials said. ATF and FBI also responded to the scene.

The shooting took place at one of the classroom buildings on the base, officials said. Officers with the Escambia County Sheriff's Office arrived on the scene and fatally shot the suspect after exchanging gunfire.
Three people, including the shooter, were pronounced dead on scene, police said. One victim was taken to the hospital and died from injuries.

Eight others injured in the shooting were transported to Baptist Hospital, police said. The condition of those victims has not been released.
""Walking through the crime scene was like being on the set of a movie,"" Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told reporters earlier in the day, adding, ""The threat has been negated, our community is secured at this time.""

None of the victims have been identified.

In a later interview with ABC News' Eva Pilgrim, Morgan confirmed the suspect used a semi-automatic handgun with an extended magazine.

Morgan described a ""war zone,"" a crime scene that could ""days to process.""

At the scene, ""a tremendous number of rounds fired,"" he added. ""Crime scene was littered with rounds.""

Two officers were among those wounded in the shooting. One officer was shot in the leg and is currently in surgery. The second officer was shot in the arm and is undergoing care at the hospital. They are both expected to survive.

They're ""doing great,"" Morgan told ABC News. ""Expect one to be released today. The other one will be in the hospital for awhile.""

""This is a dark day for a very great place,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""It not only strikes at the heart of the community of northwest Florida but throughout the Navy.""

The FBI is leading the investigation with local authorities and ATF assisting, officials said. The U.S. Attorney's Office is also involved.
According to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation, authorities are urgently focused on two likely possible motives: whether the shooter had religious or ideological reasons; or was there a problem or hostility that developed in the course of the training at Pensacola.
""Base security and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are currently investigating.  The names of the victims will not be released until the next of kin have been notified,"" the Navy said in a statement.

A handgun was identified as the weapon used by the suspect. Only security forces are allowed to carry weapons on the base, Kinsella said.

The shooter was part of an international training service where officers from partner nations are brought to NAS Pensacola to train, Kinsella said, adding that the suspect was part of the ""aviation pipeline.""
The base is shut down until further notice, according to Kinsella.

Mental health coordinators have been sent to talk to witnesses and the victims' families, DeSantis said. The Department of Children and Family Services has sent a mobile response team to the area.

NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. The facility includes the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Marine Aviation Training Support Group 21 and 23, the Blue Angels, and the headquarters for Naval Education Training Command.
During his roundtable on small business and red tape reduction accomplishments on Friday, President Donald Trump sent his condolences to families of the ""warriors"" killed and spoke about his call with the King of Saudi Arabia.

""I can tell you it's a horrible thing that took place and we're getting to the bottom on it,"" Trump said. ""All of the investigators are there now and they're studying it very closely and terrible thing, and our condolences to the families.""

The president also echoed what he said in his previous tweet about his call with the King of Saudi Arabia.

""The king said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shoots and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people so much,"" Trump said.
This is the second shooting incident on a Navy base in the last week.

A 22-year-old active-duty sailor opened fire on three civilian employees, killing two, before he fatally shot himself at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard near Honolulu on Wednesday, military officials said.
The suspected shooter opened fire on shipyard personnel with his M4 service rifle and then used his M9 service pistol to shoot himself, officials said.

"'Richard Jewell' cast, his mom talk 1996 bombing",https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-richard-jewell-hero-turned-suspect-1996-olympics/story?id=67694901,"
The world first came to know Richard Jewell during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The former security guard was working at Centennial Olympic Park when a pipe bomb exploded. His quick thinking saved countless lives and he was hailed as a hero -- until he wasn’t.

Shortly after the bomb blast, which resulted in two deaths and over 100 people injured, Jewell was named a suspect, and for weeks, his life was at the center of a media firestorm.

""I think everybody then started focusing on Richard Jewell and turning his life inside out, and making their life a living hell, instead of running around and  trying to see whether or not there’s other people that could’ve done this,"" G. Watson Bryant, Jewell’s longtime friend and attorney, told ABC News.
Twenty-three years later, the story of Jewell, who died in 2007, will be depicted in the eponymous film directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Paul Walter Hauser as Jewell and Kathy Bates as his mother, Bobi Jewell.
Richard Jewell was working as a security guard at Centennial Park on the evening of July 27, 1996. On that night, there was a Jack Mack and the Heart Attack concert and ""tens of thousands"" of people were in attendance, according to Tom Davis, a retired police officer who was stationed at the park with Jewell.
Thirty minutes before the bomb went off, a man called 911 warning of a bomb in the park and saying that it would detonate in 30 minutes. It released shrapnel everywhere once it detonated.

Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET

""I remember the heat,"" Davis said. ""I remember the smell of gunpowder. I remember seeing things falling from the sky as I started to get my wits about me. … It didn’t knock the wind out of me but it was like everything was in slow motion. It put me in a state of confusion for a few seconds because I just didn’t know what happened.""

There could’ve been scores more concertgoers killed or injured. But Jewell had spotted the bag holding the bomb underneath a bench shortly before it went off. In that critical moment, which is also depicted in the film, Jewell cautioned his colleagues about getting near the bag and instead called it in as a suspicious package.

""I think that lives were saved because of actions that we all took that night of trying to get that perimeter established as quickly as we possibly could,"" Davis said.
Richard Jewell’s quick thinking thrust him into the international spotlight. He appeared on TV news for interviews and journalists were staking out at his home.

""I couldn’t believe it. I mean, he was just Richard to me. But then when there are 97,000 photographers out front, and a few more phones ringing...you know, it’s surreal,"" Bobi Jewell told ABC News.

Within days, however, the public’s view of Richard Jewell flipped once Jewell’s hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ran a headline reading, ""FBI suspects 'hero' guard may have planted bomb.""

""A great reporter named Kathy Scruggs managed to get this incredible scoop, which means somebody in law enforcement had leaked it,"" said Kent Alexander, the U.S. attorney assigned to investigate the bombing and author of a book on the incident titled ""The Suspect.""

""When this story broke, it was like nothing anybody in law enforcement had ever seen, because it was...everywhere,"" he continued.
Reporters who were once seeking comment from the Jewells about his heroism were now asking about the allegations that he’d planted the bomb. It didn’t help when he left his home escorted by two FBI agents.

""He was worn, torn and tattered. He really was,"" said Bobi Jewell of her son’s reaction to the turn of events.

The FBI agents had told Richard Jewell that he was going to their Atlanta headquarters to help create a police training video. However, when he arrived, they began questioning him about the bombing.

In never-before-released video from his interrogation, an FBI agent can be seen telling Richard Jewell: ""The reason you’re here today is we’re interviewing all the individuals that were at Centennial Park when the bomb went off.""
""Richard Jewell, he’s mic’d up, he’s got his Olympics hat on, he’s sitting in the corner with the two agents facing him -- the cameraman in the back -- and they start going through lots of questions,"" said Alexander.

It wasn’t until the FBI agents handed Richard Jewell a form with his Miranda Rights that his disposition changed, and he wondered out loud if he should have an attorney present.
""I don’t know if I should call an attorney now or not because I don’t know if this video is for -- after what the news people [said] -- I don’t know if I’m being investigated for this or if this is what you told me it’s for,"" Richard Jewell said in the interrogation tape.

Richard Jewell called Bryant and asked Bryant to represent him. Of that moment in the interrogation room, Bryant said, ""I think I told him to shut the hell up and get his fat ass out of there.""

Bryant, who is portrayed by Sam Rockwell in the film, became a fierce defender of Richard Jewell. He said he believed Richard Jewell didn’t commit the bombing because he knew him to be a good person.
""I knew him to be a good, decent guy,"" Bryant said. ""If he had $2, he’d spend $4 buying you presents. He’d give you the shirt off his back.""

As part of their investigation into Richard Jewell, the FBI searched the home he lived in with his mother and left with some of her possessions, including VHS tapes and tupperware.

""I couldn’t believe it. They had taken -- and I love to say this, because I love tupperware -- they had my flour, my sugar, my macaroni, anything that I had in tupperware,"" Bobi Jewell said.

Bobi Jewell ultimately chose to speak publicly in defense of her son. During a press conference, she made an emotional plea to then-President Bill Clinton to clear his name if the FBI didn’t intend to charge him with anything.

""She was uncomfortable,"" Bates said of the mother she portrays on screen. ""She was in a room full of  people that had maligned her  son. … I think that tension of really trying to hold on to emotion, really trying to keep it in, and then not being able to at the end.""

Bates has earned  praise for her performance in ""Richard Jewell,"" but the film itself stirred up controversy for the way it portrays Scruggs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter played by Olivia Wilde. In the film, Scruggs’ character trades sex for the scoop that placed Richard Jewell as a suspect.
A letter to Clint Eastwood and his team sent by lawyers representing the Atlanta newspaper said that the film ""falsely portrays the AJC and its personnel as extraordinarily reckless, using unprofessional and highly inappropriate reporting methods. … Such a portrayal makes it appear that the AJC sexually exploited its staff and/or that it facilitated or condoned offering sexual gratification to sources in exchange for stories. That is entirely false and malicious, and it is extremely defamatory and damaging.""
Both Eastwood and Hauser pushed back on these assertions.

""I can understand why everybody would get defensive on this  thing, but the plain facts are they were the first ones to notify the public that this was going on,"" Eastwood told ABC News. ""But I don’t hold it against them. I read their paper. It seems fine. I assume that they just got wrapped up in the euphoria, like everybody else.""
""I know that working in Hollywood, Hollywood takes artistic liberties in their storytelling to tell a narrative,"" Hauser added. ""So, while I appreciate their opinions, if they think it’s going to extinguish what we’re trying to do with the Jewell family, they would be incorrect.""

On Thursday, Olivia Wilde tweeted that she doesn't believe Scruggs ""traded sex for tips,"" but rather, that her character was in a ""pre-existing romantic relationship"" with the ""FBI agent who leaked false information to her.""The perspective of the fictional dramatization of the story, as I understood it, was that Kathy, and the FBI agent who leaked false information to her, were in a pre-existing romantic relationship, not a transactional exchange of sex for information.— olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) December 12, 2019 The perspective of the fictional dramatization of the story, as I understood it, was that Kathy, and the FBI agent who leaked false information to her, were in a pre-existing romantic relationship, not a transactional exchange of sex for information.
Richard Jewell’s 88 days of scrutiny and investigation ended on Oct. 26, 1996, when authorities cleared his name as a suspect. Seven years later, the actual bomber, Eric Rudolph, was arrested. Rudolph, it turns out, was wanted for a series of bombings across the country.

Bobi Jewell said the film will ""finally"" vindicate her son in history, although she wishes it had happened 23 years ago.
""You’re making a film. You hope that you can make it so it has an entertainment value and a value of information out there,"" Eastwood said. ""But then, all of a sudden, here’s somebody who’s living now, [who] has lived through the whole thing. And she feels there’s some vindication in the film. That’s very humbling.""

Richard Jewell was 44 years old when he died in 2007 of a heart attack. Bobi Jewell said she thinks the intense scrutiny and misjudgment her son endured took a toll on his life.

""I think it killed him,"" Bobi Jewell said, ""I really do.""

"Trial set for Sandy Hook families, gun-maker Remington over school massacre",https://abcnews.go.com/US/trial-set-sandy-hook-families-gun-maker-remington/story?id=67686217,"
A Connecticut judge has set a trial date for families of victims of the Sandy Hook school massacre to face the manufacturer whose guns were used in the deadly 2012 shooting.

The trial is set to take place  September 2021, nearly a decade after 20-year-old Adam Lanza stormed into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, with a Remington Bushmaster AR-15 and killed 26 people, including 20 students. The tragedy is one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

The relatives of nine victims and one survivor filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Remington Arms in 2015, accusing the country's oldest gun-maker of illegally marketing the military-style semiautomatic weapon to at-risk young men.
""After nearly five years of legal maneuvering by Remington, we will finally discover what went on behind closed doors that led to the company’s reckless marketing of the Bushmaster AR-15,"" Josh Koskoff, a lawyer for the victims, told Reuters in a statement. ""The families’ faith in the legal system has never wavered and they look forward to presenting their case to a Connecticut jury.""
The 2021 trial date was decided after nearly two hours of talks between attorneys on both sides of the argument. Connecticut's top court ruled that the families could sue Remington back in March.

The North Carolina-based company filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court last month, but the court declined to hear the appeal.

Remington did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

About 50 people gathered Saturday for a vigil in honor of the victims at the Olive Baptist Church in Pensacola, located about 3 miles from Naval Air Station Pensacola where the shooting broke out Friday morning.

The victims were identified Saturday night as Ensign Joshua Watson, 23; Airman Mohammed Haitham, 19; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Walters, 21.

Yet, amid the tragedy, Robinson said he was reminded of the city's spirit.

""Everyone working together to work in support of a mission … that's what this community is,"" he said.
Chief Deputy Chip W. Simmons, of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office, also attended the vigil and described getting the call about the active shooter.

While officials often get reports of an active shooter, this was the first at the naval base, ""at a facility that we take so much pride in.""

He remembers the closer he got to the facility, ""the more gunshots I heard over the police radio.""

""It isn’t until everything’s settled down you realize what you’ve seen,"" Simmons said. ""What you’re experiencing is the loss of life, hatred … but also you realize what you’re seeing is heroism.”
Simmons said officials are still working to determine exactly what unfolded and why, including whether or not the incident was terror-related.

According to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation, authorities are urgently focused on two likely possible motives: whether the shooter had religious or ideological reasons, or whether there was a problem that developed in the course of his training at Pensacola.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper echoed that the investigation is ongoing at the Reagan Defense Forum Saturday afternoon: ""I can’t say it’s terrorism at this time."" He said he will let the FBI do its work to determine the cause.
Eight people were transported to the hospital with injuries, police said. The conditions of those victims have not yet been officially released.

However, Simmons said the three police officers among the injured are ""going to be fine."" He said he didn't know the conditions of the others.

None of those injured have been identified.
Pastor Ted Traylor urged the community to support one another during this time. He also called on residents to be mindful when speaking about the tragedy.

""There’s gonna be conversations about what’s happened over here and I’m gonna ask you be mindful when you have those conversations,"" Traylor said. ""It’s a small community here and the person standing to the left or right could be involved.""

Just as there will be heightened security around the base, he said, ""I pray that our community has a heightened sense of sensitivity.”

Charges dropped against teen accused of shooting twin brother,https://abcnews.go.com/US/charges-dropped-philadelphia-teen-accused-fatally-shooting-twin/story?id=67646639,"
The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office dropped charges against a high school football player who had been accused of murdering his twin brother.

Fayaadh Gillard, 18, was cleared of murder charges in connection with the death of his twin, Suhail Gillard, who was fatally shot in the chest as their father, Aleem Gillard, was teaching them how to load and unload a gun last week, according to the teen's attorney.

""There are times when a win does not feel like a win because there is no amount of winning that will balance out the loss that this family has seen over the past couple of weeks,"" attorney Shaka Johnson, who is representing Fayaadh, told ABC News on Wednesday. ""It won't undo the tragedy or the psychological and emotional harm, but it is a step in a step toward healing.""

""This young man has lost his innocence in a way that he can never recover. He will require therapy for years to come,"" he added.
Family members had argued for the charges to be cleared because they were allegedly based on a false narrative concocted by the father, who allegedly told the twins and their 16-year-old sister to lie about the circumstances in an effort to protect himself from potential prosecution.

Aleem Gillard, 42, demonstrated how to load and unload the gun and told Fayaadh to do the same thing when it accidentally went off, striking his brother, according to the siblings. They were instructed to walk the wounded teen down several flights of stairs to the building's lobby before calling for help, they said.

Officers responded to a call about a shooting last Sunday around 5:30 p.m. and found Suhail suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. He was transported to Lankenau Medical Center by police and pronounced dead hours later.
Fayaadh initially told police that his brother had been shot by an unknown assailant, but he admitted to pulling the trigger when officers told him that Suhail died during surgery. His father, who is a convicted felon, allegedly told him to say Suhail had been shot in the lobby and not inside his apartment, according to the family.

Aleem Gillard is currently on probation and is prohibited from possessing firearms. He declined to comment when contacted by ABC News.

Aleem Gillard has a lengthy criminal record and has pleaded guilty to charges of  assault, reckless endangerment, illegal gun possession, criminal conspiracy, and other crimes dating back to the 1990s, court records show.

He is also paralyzed from the waist down due to gun violence.
Johnson said investigators showed him video from the slain teen's Instagram story, showing his father dancing in his wheelchair with one of his two pistols in his hand.

He said he wouldn't be surprised if the District Attorney's Office decided to charge Aleem Gillard.

""If you set into motion a series of events that are reckless and likely to cause death, that's enough to charge a person with murder,"" Johnson said. ""I've spoken with the DA's office and I wouldn't be surprised if they charged him with third degree murder, and they'll probably hold him without bail.""

Alabama mourns 7th officer killed in line of duty this year,https://abcnews.go.com/US/alabama-mourns-7th-police-officer-killed-line-duty/story?id=67568646,"
The state of Alabama is mourning the seventh law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty this year.

During a drug bust investigation in Huntsville on Friday, officer Billy Fred Clardy III was shot by ""a known offender,"" who was expected to drop off a large amount of drugs to the undercover officers, according to a statement issued by the Hunstville Police Department on Saturday.

The gunman, identified by police as LaJeromeny Brown, allegedly shot Clardy in an area not covered by his bulletproof vest before fleeing on foot. Brown, 41, was taken into custody on Friday night and charged with capital murder of a police officer, according to Madison County online records.
Hunstiville Police Chief Mark McMurray said Clardy died at the hospital Friday night and the doctors ""did everything they could"" to save his life. Clardy was 48.

""Our City is broken hearted tonight,"" said Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle in a statement issued on Friday.
Clardy's father, Billy Fred Clardy Jr., was killed in the line of duty with the Huntsville Police Department on May 3, 1978, officials said.

""[He was] also an exceptional police officer with many career accomplishments,"" the police department said in a statement. ""He started his career working North Huntsville as a patrol officer. He quickly moved to become a Community Relations Officer for several years, became a part of the very first HPD Anti-Crime Team and then became a STAC Agent.""

Clardy, an Army veteran, is survived by his wife and five children.

""It has been an exceptionally tough year for our law enforcement community, and this will be felt across our state,"" said Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey in a statement Friday.
At the end of November 2019, Lowndes County Sheriff John ""Big John"" Williams was shot and killed as he was reporting to a convenient store where a group was loitering in the parking lot. William Chase Johnson, the son of a law enforcement officer, was arrested and charged for the capital murder of the 62-year-old.

Two months earlier, Tuscaloosa police officer Dornell Cousette was shot and killed while pursing robbery suspect Luther Bernard Watkins. Watkins, 20, was charged with capital murder.

Monroe County Deputy Sheriff Julius Jamal Dailey lost control of his patrol car on June 11, 2019, and crashed. Dailey, 29, was responding to a burglary in progress, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) which tracks line-of-duty deaths of law enforcement officers.
Auburn police officer William Ray Buechner Jr. and two other officers responded to a domestic disturbance on May 19, 2019 when shots were fired from the residence. All three officers were shot, but Buechner died. Grady Wayne Wilkes was arrested the following day and charged with capital murder.

The year began with Alabama losing two officers within a seven-day period.
Mobile police officer Sean Paul Tuder was shot and killed while attempting to arrest 18-year-old Marco Perez on Jan. 20, 2019. Prosecutors filed a motion in October 2019 to seek the death penalty for Perez who is charged with capital murder.

Seven days prior to Tuder's death, Birmingham Sgt. WyTasha Lamar Carter was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Michael Todd, 18, and Jeremy Owens, 31, were charged in connection with Carter's death. Owens is charged with capital murder.

In total, 113 law enforcement officers were killed while on duty across the country in 2019, according to ODMP. Only three states, all which much larger populations -- New York, Texas and California -- have had more deaths in the line of duty this year than Alabama.

California fines CVS $3.6M for failing to recycle,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-fines-cvs-36-million-failing-recycle-67611988,"
California is fining the nation's largest pharmacy health care provider a record $3.6 million for failing to redeem deposits on bottles and cans at some of its locations, regulators said Monday.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, better known as CalRecycle, said its investigation found that 81 of CVS Pharmacy’s 848 retail stores in California refused to redeem the recyclables or pay a required $100 daily fee as an alternative.
CalRecycle filed the enforcement action last week, and CVS can seek a hearing if it wants to contest the fine. Department spokesman Lance Klug said it's the largest enforcement action ever against a retailer for failing to redeem recyclables.
The company “is committed to contributing to healthier, more sustainable communities and we are currently reviewing the state of California’s filing,"" spokesman Mike DeAngelis said in an email.
One of CalRecycle's most vocal critics praised the department's action as a good first step to helping prop up the recycling industry. The industry has faltered due to a drop in value for scrap metal and aluminum and as other countries, particularly China, have become more picky in the types of waste they will buy from the United States.
The vast majority of nearly 4,000 beverage retailers have agreed to redeem bottles and cans if consumers can't find another convenient recycler. But Consumer Watchdog estimated from limited data that half to two-thirds of those retailers may be refusing to do so.
“They've fined before, but they haven’t done it regularly or a lot,” Consumer Watchdog advocate Liza Tucker said of state regulators. ""They're sending a signal that it isn’t business as unusual, we’re really going to apply fines that are bigger than in the past.”
Even for the pharmacy giant, $3.6 million ""is enough to get CVS' attention and enough to get the attention of the entire retail community,” Tucker said. “This is the wake-up call.”
The enforcement action seeks to recover $1.8 million in $100-a-day fees that the 81 stores failed to pay by the end of October, and another $1.8 million in civil penalties. The total fine is a state record against retailers that are supposed to redeem cans and bottles. 
Jared Blumenfeld, California's secretary for Environmental Protection, said in a statement that the goal is to send a message that the state ""will hold retailers accountable for refunding consumers their nickel and dime recycling deposits.”
California is one of 10 states with a deposit-refund system for beverage containers. Consumers pay an extra 5 cents for bottles up to 24 ounces (709.76 milliliters) and 10 cents for bottles more than 24 ounces.
They're supposed to get that money back by recycling the bottle or can once they are finished with it. But Consumer Watchdog said more consumers are throwing them away because they can't find a convenient recycling location. 
More than half the state's recycling centers have closed in the last five years, according to an analysis of state data by the Container Recycling Institute, though CalRecycle says about 1,200 remain.
State subsidies to recyclers have increased each of the last four years, including $176 million last year. It's devoting another $15 million this year to aid recycling centers and spur projects like using mobile redemption centers in areas with high rents and community opposition to permanent recycling centers.
CalRecycle Director Scott Smithline, who is retiring at year's end, said the fine is part of agency actions that includes intensified inspections. Klug, the department spokesman, said that has included 2,180 inspections since August, with a priority on retailers who have had the largest number of violations and penalties owed."
Man dead for years identified as suspect in 1984 murder of 15-year-old girl,https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-dead-years-identified-suspect-1984-murder-15/story?id=67465538,"
Decades after a teenage girl was stabbed to death at her grandparents' home, DNA and genetic genealogy have been used to identify her suspected killer -- a man dead for years.

On June 15, 1984, the body of 15-year-old Reesa Trexler was found nude in a bedroom at her grandparents' house in North Carolina, Salisbury Police Sgt. Travis Shulenberger said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Trexler had been stabbed multiple times, and her spinal cord was severed, Shulenberger said.
Semen from her unknown killer was recovered from her body, Shulenberger said, but the case went unsolved for decades.

In 2018, Trexler's sister went on the ""Dr. Phil"" show, which ""sparked new interest in the case,"" Shulenberger said.
Salisbury police detectives and state investigators conducted interviews, reviewed evidence, collected DNA samples and worked with crime labs to try to solve the case, Shulenberger said.

This year, it was the use of genetic genealogy that cracked the case.

Genetic genealogy compares unknown DNA evidence from a crime scene to public databases, which are populated by the DNA of family members who voluntarily upload their own.
Genetic genealogy has been called a ""game-changer"" in cracking cold cases. Since the arrest of the suspected ""Golden State Killer"" in April 2018, about 100 suspects have been identified through the technology, according to Parabon NanoLabs Chief Genetic Genealogist CeCe Moore, who worked on the Trexler case.
But as law enforcement agencies across the country ramp up the use of genetic genealogy, some are concerned the tool is an invasion of privacy to those who voluntarily submit their DNA to databases for family ancestry purposes.

When the DNA from the semen left on Trexler's body was uploaded to a public genetic database, Parabon genealogists reverse-engineered the suspect's family tree to determine possible suspects, police said.
Authorities narrowed down the family members to determine their suspect, who was in his 40s at the time of the crime.

The suspect, who was not named, died in 2007, said police.

With a court order, investigators exhumed the suspect’s body and determined that his DNA matched the suspect's semen from the crime scene.
""Fortunately, DNA science has come a long way since 1984,"" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said at Tuesday's news conference, calling it ""a powerful tool.""

Police previously had speculated Trexler's killer was a family member, but the suspect, who had a criminal history including assault with a deadly weapon, was not related and had no connection to the Trexler family, Shulenberger said.

Salisbury police Lt. Greg Beam said the department is not naming the suspect because he has no way of defending himself in a court of law.

Police now consider the case closed. No charges are expected.

""Nothing is going to bring Reesa back,"" Shulenberger said, ""but we have some closure to the case now."""

Family of twin killed by brother accuses father of pinning blame on son,https://abcnews.go.com/US/family-twin-killed-brother-accuses-father-pinning-blame/story?id=67570637,"
A Philadelphia father was teaching his twin sons how to load and aim a firearm when one of the teens fatally shot his brother in the chest, according to their family.

Fayaadh Gillard, 18, was charged with murder in connection with the death of his twin, Suhail Gillard, but other family members said the charges are based on a false narrative concocted by their father, who allegedly told them to lie about the circumstances in an effort to protect himself from potential prosecution.

""My mother allowed them to visit their father after keeping them away because of the type of person he is,"" Nafis Woods, the twins' older brother, who was not present at the shooting, told ABC News. ""He doesn't have much to show them far as being an idol, so he decided to show them guns out of all things -- the thing that we try to keep them far away from.""

""These are kids that listen to their parents, they're not disobedient or dishonest. They're like babies,"" he added.
Officers responded to a call about a shooting on Dec. 1 at around 5:30 p.m. and found Suhail suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. He was transported to Lankenau Medical Center by police and pronounced dead hours later.

Fayaadh initially told police that his brother had been shot by an unknown assailant, but he admitted to pulling the trigger when officers told him that Suhail died during surgery, the family's attorney said. His father, who is a convicted felon, allegedly told him to say Suhail had been shot elsewhere, not inside his apartment and not with his father's gun, according to the family. The twins' father is currently on probation and is prohibited from possessing firearms.
Investigators have not revealed any details about the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but family members said they're confident that no foul play was involved.

""He demonstrated how to load and unload the gun and then he handed it to Fayaadh and told him to do the same thing and it accidentally went off. He was clearly inexperienced with even touching a gun,"" Woods, 23, said. ""My baby sister was also there. She said they everyone started screaming and hollering when it happened.""

Woods said his siblings, including his 16-year-old sister Hassinah, were instructed to walk the wounded teen down several flights of stairs to the building's lobby before calling for help, wasting precious moments that could have saved his brother's life.
""He made sure they understood to tell a detailed and specific lie to make sure that he was covered,"" Woods said. ""He even made them walk down flights of stairs to the lobby of the place to make it seem as if it didn't happen in the apartment so that he wouldn't get in trouble.""

ABC News spoke to Aleem Gillard to ask for his account of the shooting, but he declined to comment. The family said he attended his son's funeral on Thursday, but they were too angry to speak to him.

""As a family, our desire is that their father acknowledges the role that he played and takes for this tragedy -- to make it clear to police that it was an accident and to make it clear where the firearms came from,"" their uncle, Hasan Ford, told ABC News. ""We want him to acknowledge that his children were following his tutelage, his instruction and his advice. He needs to tell the truth and let everyone know that every decision that they made was only as a result of him and his ideas and his intent.""

""These kids are the farthest that you can imagine from being involved in any form of street life. Their father is involved knee-deep into that life, so for him, this is his way of showing his children that he is somebody,"" he added.

Aleem Gillard, 42, has a lengthy criminal record and has pleaded guilty to charges of  assault, reckless endangerment, illegal gun possession, criminal conspiracy and other crimes dating back to the 1990s, court records show.
He is also paralyzed from the waist down due to gun violence.

Attorney Shaka Johnson, who is representing the family, said investigators showed them video from the slain teen's Instagram story, showing his father dancing in his wheelchair with one of his two pistols in his hand.

""To hand a gun to a kid and just run through a quick show-and-tell is probably the single most reckless thing I've ever heard in my entire life. He eventually left them to their own devices with the loaded gun while he went to the bathroom,"" Johnson told ABC News.
Fayaadh has been charged with third-degree murder in his brother's death, but Johnson said he is seeking to have him fully exonerated and his father charged instead.

""If you set into motion a series of events that are reckless and likely to cause death, that's enough to charge a person with murder,"" Johnson said. ""I've spoken with the DA's office and I wouldn't be surprised if they charged him with third-degree murder, and they'll probably hold him without bail.""

Fayaadh was released on $125,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday. He was able to attend his brother's funeral, but the family said he's weighed with the guilt and barely speaking.
""This young man will have to go through life with a black cloud over him. He's going to need therapy for years and years to come,"" Johnson said. ""Imagine what graduation is going to be like for this kid when they get to his brother's name.""

Family members said the twins were ""like the same person"" and had never spent a night without each other. Their lives were all about their brotherhood, academics and football, the family said.

John Davidson, assistant principal and head football coach for Mastery Charter School Lenfest Campus, where the brothers were both seniors, said the loss had shaken the school community. He described the brothers as ""scholar athletes"" who were fielding college offers from several schools.

""They always stood together in times of battle. They loved each other dearly and they were always loyal,"" Davidson said. ""These were loving brothers. They were significant in our football program, they were significant in our school and they were typical high school young men.""
Davidson said the brothers had attended the charter school since seventh grade and were Philadelphia all-stars and Suhail was a three-time All-Public League player and also a member of the school's track team.

The school hosted a balloon-releasing ceremony for Suhail at Penn's Landing, the waterfront park where the school is scheduled to hold its senior graduation later this year. The school is also planning to present the teen's mother with a trophy and jersey in the near future, according to Davidson.

He said he was encouraged by the outpouring of love for Suhail at his funeral last week.

""It was truly a powerful sight. You had two lines that went around the corner at his viewing. It was a sea of people out there to pay their respects to the family,"" Davidson said. ""It was a heartfelt display from the city of Philadelphia for this young man."""
$120K banana art exhibit removed after it was eaten,https://abcnews.go.com/US/art-basel-miami-beach-removes-120000-banana-taped/story?id=67579194,"
An art piece of a banana duct-taped to a wall, which captured a lot of buzz in the past week, has reportedly been taken down at the Art Basel show in Miami Beach.

""The crowds surrounding the installation posed a serious health and safety risk, as well as an access issue, so the work was removed,"" Art Basel said in a statement to The New York Times on Sunday.

The controversy-stirring artwork first sold for $120,000, and then was sold two more times for $120,000 to $150,000, reported The Times.
The valuable fruit was plucked off the wall and eaten by performance artist David Datuna on Saturday in front of a roomful of stunned art aficionados.         View this post on Instagram           “Hungry Artist” Art performance by me 🙂 I love Maurizio Cattelan artwork and I really love this installation It’s very delicious 🙂 #artbasel #artbaselmiamibeach #daviddatuna #Eatingabanana #Mauriziocattelan #Hungryartist A post shared by  David Datuna (@david_datuna) on Dec 7, 2019 at 11:38am PST  “Hungry Artist” Art performance by me 🙂 I love Maurizio Cattelan artwork and I really love this installation It’s very delicious 🙂 #artbasel #artbaselmiamibeach #daviddatuna #Eatingabanana #Mauriziocattelan #HungryartistA post shared by  David Datuna (@david_datuna) on Dec 7, 2019 at 11:38am PST
When asked what he was doing by an attendee at the show, Datuna allegedly stated that he was a performance artist, according to the Miami Herald.

To many people's surprise, the consumed banana does not actually reduce the artwork's price, Lucien Terras, director of museum relations for Galerie Perrotin, told the Miami Herald.

The art, called ""The Comedian"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, has a certificate of authenticity, considered valuable because the document certifies that the work was done by the noted artist.

Another banana was taped to the wall after the incident, Terras said.

Datuna, who according to his own website is a ""Smithsonian-recognized, New York-based artist focused on the convergence of art and social consciousness,"" was escorted out of the gallery by security but was not arrested.
A Facebook page presumably belonging to Datuna features an image of Datuna holding a banana with the caption, “It was delicious.”
Cattelan, who has no formal art training, ""has often been characterized as the court jester of the art world,"" according to a profile of him on the Guggenheim Museum’s website.

Cattelan’s banana art has sparked conversations over how art is valued, as well as several spoofs.

Popeye’s Chicken tweeted its version of Cattelan’s conceptual piece:Don’t eat the art. Even though it’s delicious.

A San Francisco Bay Area mother suspected of ramming her car into her son's barber following a haircut surrendered to authorities, police said.
Ruby Delgadillo, 28, brought an attorney with her when she turned herself in Wednesday and refused to give a statement to detectives, the Antioch Police Department said.
Police said Delgadillo last week rammed into Brian Martin, 63, with her car, smashing him into a glass storefront and breaking his leg because she was upset with her son's haircut.
“She was trying to kill me,"" said Martin, owner of the Delta Barber Shop in Antioch, a city 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of San Francisco. 
Martin told reporters Delgadillo had been his customer for over a year and was usually pleasant but last Wednesday she became upset over a small nick on her son's neck.
Martin said she appeared to snap, locking eyes just before driving into him. 
He said the boy sustained the small scratch because he wouldn't sit still. 
Delgadillo, of Brentwood, was booked into Contra Costa County jail in Martinez and is scheduled to be in court Thursday, the department said in a statement. It did not say what charges she faces. "
"Dad falls, dies hanging Christmas lights with son",https://abcnews.go.com/US/dad-dies-falling-off-roof-hanging-christmas-lights/story?id=67486442,"
A man in Texas has died after he fell off a roof while he was hanging Christmas lights with his son to earn some extra holiday money.

Felipe Gallegos was hanging lights on the roof of a house with his 17-year-old son in Argyle, Texas, last Saturday when his wife who was in the front yard heard a loud noise.

“He was on the roof and then we heard something,” said Gallegos’ widow Alisha Flick to ABC News’ Dallas affiliate station WFAA. “He was lying on the concrete saying ‘help me, help me.’”
Flick called 911 immediately and Gallegos was taken to the emergency room for treatment.

“The CAT scan came back and he had a skull fracture and bleeding in the brain. And then he had a chest fracture and they had to drain blood from his chest. They rushed him into emergency surgery but he didn’t make it,” Flick said tearfully.

A GoFundMe campaign to help support Flick and her 17-year-old son in the aftermath of Gallegos’ death has brought in close to $50,000 from almost 500 donors.
""He always had a smile on his face, and he was always goofy and making everybody laugh,"" a clearly heartbroken Flick told WFAA.

With just a few weeks to go before Christmas Gallegos’ sudden death has left an enormous void for his surviving wife and son.

Said Flick: “It’s hard enough losing somebody when they are sick but at least you know it’s coming. With this, you had no idea.”

Roldan A. Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr., who worked for the Department of Defense, were killed by a 22-year-old gunman, officials said.

""Our lives have been changed forever,"" said Kapoi's sister, Theona, who read from a statement to members of the media on Friday outside of the military base. ""There are so many unanswered questions, but we all have to be honest, it changes nothing because we can't bring him back.""

A third worker was also shot and was in critical condition, officials said.

The alleged shooter has been identified as Gabriel Romero, officials said. A machinist's mate auxiliary fireman from Texas, Romero was assigned to the USS Columbia, a submarine that was docked as the shipyard for routine maintenance.

Authorities believe Romero opened fire Thursday at the crowded military base near Honolulu.

""The incident happened in 23 seconds,"" said Norm Dominesey, NCIS special agent-in-charge at a press conference on Friday.
Officials are still investigating the shooting and the motive, though there are no apparent ties to domestic terrorism, Dominesey said.

While it's unclear if Romero knew any of the victims, an anonymous military official told the Associate Press that he was seeking counseling and faced non-judicial punishment, which is a lower-level administrative process for minor misconduct.The civilians have been identified:- Vincent J.

As the investigation continues, the families of Agustin and Kapoi them as family men.

""Having grown up in Waipahu, Roldan enjoyed working on cars with his friends and spending time with his family and adored his nieces,"" according to a statement obtained by ABC News affiliate KITV. ""We will forever remember Roldan to be humble and honest, and a generous and patient man.""

Kapoi, 30, was a metals inspector apprentice and Agustin, 49, was a shop planner. They both worked on the shipyard along with thousands of others who witnessed the bloodshed, said Dominesey.
A funeral for Vincent Kapoi is planned for Dec. 15 at 3 p.m. at the Kapalama School Chapel at Kamehameha Schools, where he graduated, relatives said.

""What we do have to do, and must do, is honor his memory, keep him alive in our hearts and please keep him in your hearts and always remember good times,"" his sister said as she fought back tears. ""May we ask for your respect and space in our time of grieving.""

Kapoi leaves behind a wife and other relatives, according a fundraising website launched by his relatives to pay for his funeral.

Arrangements for Agustin were not known as of Saturday.

""He was a loving son, brother, uncle and friend to many,"" the Agustin family said."
"Western storm will cross country and bring snow, rain from California to New York",https://abcnews.go.com/US/western-storm-cross-country-bring-snow-rain-california/story?id=67540682,"
A brand new storm will be moving into Northern California and Southern Oregon later today with heavy rain all the way down to the San Francisco Bay area and heavy snow in the mountains.

Storm alerts have been issued from Oregon to California this morning.
Heavy rain will move into the northern San Francisco Bay area Friday evening to finish off the rush hour. Flash flooding is possible and there is a threat of mudslides.
Friday night through Saturday night, heavy rain will begin to spread through most of the West Coast from Seattle to San Diego -- but these areas will not see a flooding threat like Northern California.

In the mountains, very heavy snow is expected, especially in the Sierra Nevada range where 4 feet of snow is expected.
By Sunday, the storm system will cross the Rockies bringing a chance of heavy snow from Colorado to Montana, where more than a foot is possible.

By Sunday night and into Monday, this storm system will redevelop in the Plains and join another system coming from Canada to produce several inches of snow in the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes, just in time for the Monday morning commute.
Further south, rain -- heavy at times -- is expected from Chicago to Atlanta and eventually into Washington, D.C. and New York City by Monday late morning into the afternoon.

Behind this cross-country storm system, the coldest air of the season will invade the northern Plains and the Midwest with wind chills well below zero and actual temperatures falling below zero as well.

25 Baltimore corrections officers charged with 'illegal and excessive' force,https://abcnews.go.com/US/25-baltimore-corrections-officers-charged-illegal-excessive-force/story?id=67489779,"
More than two dozen Baltimore, Maryland, corrections officers were indicted Tuesday with allegations that they used ""illegal and excessive"" force against inmates in state jails.

""All 25 of these correctional officers have allegedly abused their power and abused our trust,"" Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said during a Tuesday news conference.
The correctional officers allegedly threatened and violently assaulted inmates, falsified public documents and tampered with evidence, according to the indictment.

""Our correctional officers have one of the most difficult jobs in all of public safety, and we will not let the criminal behavior of the few tarnish the great work of the nearly 5,000 dedicated officers who serve with distinction every single day,"" Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement.
The incidents -- dated back to 2016 and occurred in different facilities across the state -- include inflicting serious physical injuries on inmates in the state's custody, and created a substantial risk of their death or disfigurement, Mosby charged.

They are also accused of bragging about their ""reputation and success"" on social media and using body language like winks and nods to warn each other when they are in the presence of other law enforcement officers that are not a part of their alleged corruption.
""We have been working diligently to root out wrongdoing and corruption no matter where it is taking place, including in the state’s correctional system,"" said Hogan. ""We have absolutely no tolerance whatsoever for corruption of any kind in our state prison system or anywhere else in state government.""

With this week's indictments, there are now more than 200 officers, inmates and citizen accomplices, who have been arrested or convicted in Maryland's investigation into its correctional system.
The latest example of corruption in Baltimore comes less than a month after Baltimore's former mayor, Catherine Pugh, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy to commit wire fraud and tax charges. The charges were linked to sales of her children's books.

""Baltimore City faces many pressing issues, and we need dedication and integrity from our leaders -- not corruption -- in order to solve them,"" U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur said in a November statement. ""Law enforcement will continue to be vigilant for evidence of fraud and corruption, to ensure that our citizens receive the honesty and professionalism they deserve from government officials.""

"Child surfer takes a tumble, camera catches that he was hit by a shark",https://abcnews.go.com/US/child-surfer-takes-tumble-camera-catches-hit-shark/story?id=67455911,"
A young surfer had a close encounter with a shark on a Florida beach caught on camera.

Chandler Moore, 7, was surfing with his father, Shaun, off New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County, with a GoPro camera attached to his surf board.

Footage his father uploaded to social media shows Chandler riding a wave. Moore's father told Reuters that his son said ""something like a fish"" jumped out of the water and scared him.

A freeze-frame of the moment the boy falls shows that the animal is clearly a small shark.
Moore confirmed that his son was not harmed during the incident.

Volusia County was dubbed “the shark bite capital of the world” by the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack File (ISAF).

National Geographic cited estimates that anyone who has swam off New Smyrna Beach has been within 10 feet of a shark.
ISAF data shows that Volusia has had more documented shark attacks than any other county in Florida -- 303 since 1882. Florida has seen the most documented shark attacks of any U.S. state, with 828 since 1837. Hawaii has the next highest total, with 162.

There have been multiple shark attacks at New Smyrna Beach in 2019, including an incident in August where two people were bitten in separate incidents that took place minutes apart at the beach. "

Arctic air is moving over the Great Lakes and the Northeast this morning, bringing bitter cold wind chills and heavy lake effect snow from Michigan to New York.

In Western New York, more than 9 inches of snow fell in Erie County Wednesday due to the lake effect. Roads were slick yesterday and lingering slick spots continue this morning.
Wind chills are in the teens and single digits in the Great Lakes and the Northeast this morning, and it feels like it’s below freezing all the way to Atlanta and Birmingham.

In the meantime, a new storm system is developing in the Gulf Coast today into tomorrow, and it will move up the East Coast Friday into Saturday with heavy rain.
By Friday, the storm system will spread heavy rain from Florida to the Carolinas.

By Friday night into Saturday morning, heavy rain is expected in the Northeast. As this heavy rain falls on existing snow cover and frozen grounds, it could produce flash flooding.
In the west, a series of storms and lots of Pacific moisture will bring heavy rain to the West Coast and heavy snow to the mountains.

Already, seven western states, from Washington to Colorado, are under winter weather alerts for heavy snow.
Snow and rain is already falling in the West this morning, and will continue into the weekend.

Through the weekend, rainfall could reach 2-4 inches in Northern California and Southern Oregon, and snow in the mountains from Washington to Colorado could  reach 2-4 feet.

"2nd woman claims she was drugged, sexually assaulted at Chicago bar",https://abcnews.go.com/US/2nd-woman-sues-chicagos-el-hefe-bar-claiming/story?id=67451331,"
A second woman came forward on Monday, claiming she was drugged and raped after visiting a Chicago bar where security guards were recently accused of standing by as another woman was sexually assaulted.

Liz Capra said she was sexually assaulted after having a drink at Chicago's El Hefe bar in 2014. She said she blacked out after having one drink there and found herself pounding on her front door when she gained consciousness later.

""All of my credit cards were stolen, my phone was stolen, they were used for thousands of dollars. The next thing I remember is running home to my house, which was over 4 miles away,"" Capra told reporters on Monday.
Capra said she filed a police report and her family took her to a hospital, where a rape kit and a toxicology screening confirmed she had been drugged and sexually assaulted. She filed a lawsuit against the bar on Monday, accusing it of negligence and willful and wanton conduct after seeing surveillance footage of another woman being assaulted there.

No arrests have been made in either case.

""I’m coming forward now, after seeing the video of Jane Doe, absolutely horrified by what happened to her,"" Capra said. ""I know it wasn’t an isolated incident, and I know that it’s happened to other women, and I can’t sit back and live with myself knowing that I’m not doing anything to stop it.""

The other alleged victim, who is being represented by the same law firm as Capra, has not been named publicly.
Capra said she developed a severe case of anxiety and became afraid to socialize in public spaces after she was allegedly assaulted.

""I never feel safe anymore the same way I used to. I used to be young and free. … That was taken from me, and I can't ever get that back,"" she said. ""It really changed my personality of who I am and what I do.""

""There was years where I was looking over my shoulder every time I pulled into my alley, wondering are they here, because they know where I live,"" she added.
El Hefe did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment, but a spokesperson for its parent company, 15 Hubbard LLC, told Chicago ABC station WLS that it was working closely with the Chicago Police Department to investigate the claims.

""Any instances involving crimes of violence, sexual or otherwise ... are abhorrent. We will work with law enforcement,"" the company said in a statement.

Athlete who helped Ice Bucket Challenge go viral has died,https://abcnews.go.com/US/athlete-helped-ice-bucket-challenge-viral-died/story?id=67604713,"
Peter Frates, the man who championed the viral Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money to find a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has died.

""Peter Frates. A husband to Julie, a father to Lucy, a son to John and Nancy, a brother to Andrew and Jennifer, Pete passed away surrounded by his loving family, peacefully at age 34, after a heroic battle with ALS,"" according to a statement from the family on Monday. ""Pete was an inspiration to so many people around the world who drew strength from his courage and resiliency.""

In summer 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge flooded the internet, with people from Irish nuns to celebrities to entire pro sports teams filming themselves dumping buckets of ice water on their heads and then challenging their friends to do the same and donate money to research for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Frates, a young college athlete from suburban Massachusetts, helped make the challenge go viral after receiving his own ALS diagnosis.

Growing up outside Boston, Frates was a three sport all-star in high school. He was captain of the football and hockey teams, but baseball was his life’s passion.
He went on to play center field for Division I Boston College, and in his final year, Frates was named captain of the baseball team.

After a short stint playing professional ball overseas, Frates came back to Boston to start a job selling insurance and met the love of his life, Julie Frates. The two dreamed of marriage and children, but only six months after they started dating, Frates said he started feeling odd and having trouble with simple tasks like buttoning his shirt. After a series of tests, doctors asked him to come in -- and to bring his parents with him. Frates was diagnosed with ALS.
ALS is a rare neurological disease that robs patients of their movements, their voice and eventually, the ability to breath, all while the mind stays alert. Almost immediately after learning he had ALS, rather than wallowing, Frates started looking at the diagnosis as a dare. Ever the team captain, he took the reins of his disease from day one.

""Remarkably, Pete never complained about his illness. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to give hope to other patients and their families. In his lifetime, he was determined to change the trajectory of a disease that had no treatment or cure,"" his family said in the statement, shared by Boston College.

Frates launched a mission to raise money to find a cure. He also married Julie.
Two-and-a-half years into his diagnosis, Frates challenged ""hundreds of best friends,"" reaching into a network of athletes with massive social media followings, to give them 24 hours to dump an ice bucket over their heads or donate to ALS. Almost instantly, major athletes, including Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who went to Boston College, and Julian Edelman, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, were taking the challenge. Then it spread to include NBA giants Lebron James and Kevin Durant, and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Chris Pratt, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and dozens of others.

""As a result, through his determination -- along with his faithful supporters, Team Frate Train -- he championed the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In August of 2014, the historic movement pioneered social media fundraising and garnered donations globally that resulted in better access to ALS care, genetic discoveries, treatments and, someday, a cure.  He was a beacon of hope for all,"" the family's statement said.
In just six weeks, the Ice Bucket Challenge raised almost a quarter of a billion dollars. But as ALS research progressed, Frates' body continued to decline.
What Frates was able to prove, his family said previously, is that one person can change the world.

""On behalf of Julie, Lucy, John, Nancy, Jennifer and Andrew, along with his extended family and multitude of friends, we ask that you celebrate Pete and the hope that he has given to so many by following his daily affirmation: Be passionate, be genuine, be hardworking and don’t ever be afraid to be great,"" his family said. ""The Frates family wishes to express its sincere gratitude for the abundant love, kindness, and support we have been the recipients of during the past eight years.""

The family asked friends and supporter to consider making a donation to the Peter Frates Family Foundation, whose ""mission is to aid progressed ALS patients in their desire to stay at home with those who love them most.""

The Memorial Mass will be held at St. Ignatius Church at Boston College Friday at 11 a.m. and will be live-streamed. More details to follow, per Boston College.

Man reunited with lost cat after 5 months thanks to microchip,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trucker-reunited-pilot-cat-months-microchip/story?id=67438664,"
An adventurous driving duo is back on the road thanks to a stranger's sweet gesture and a piece of technology the size of a grain of rice.

Ashes, a 3-year-old gray cat who was found at a truck stop in Ohio earlier this month, was reunited with his owner who was multiple states away -- all thanks to a microchip.Matthew couldn't believe it when he got a call that his cat Ashes, who had gone missing at a truck stop in Ohio in August, was safe and sound at #LollypopFarm. Thanks to a microchip, these two got back on the road yesterday - together. 🚚Their story: https://t.co/5gMffsrbK3 pic.twitter.com/FLMNBFmCw3
Lollypop Farm, the Humane Society of Greater Rochester, shared the sweet story on social media to serve as a reminder for pet owners about the importance of microchips to locate lost animals.

A woman spotted the small gray cat after she pulled over at a Love’s Travel Stop in Ohio while moving across the country from the West Coast, the humane society explained in a blog post. The kind feline-friendly stranger apparently looked for its owner and asked around if anyone knew of a missing cat, then bundled it up in a blanket and brought it to her car.
When she arrived in Rochester, the woman took the cat to Lollypop Farm where the admissions team scanned the animal for a microchip and found its possible owner.

""Not only did he have one, but he had an owner who had registered him under a Texas address that was over 1,465 miles away,"" the shelter wrote in a blog post. ""This was one cross-country kitty.""

Matthew B., a trucker with an 18-wheeler, had lost his longtime travel companion Ashes when the pair passed through Springfield, Ohio, in July, according to Lollypop Farm.

""I had been thinking about Ashes every day,"" Matthew told Lollypop Farm.

He even re-routed other trips through the area to go back to the Love's rest stop where the cat went missing to search for his furry friend, but came up short.

Less than two weeks after Ashes arrived, the relieved owner was able to shift his schedule and drive up the East Coast to reunite with the cat in Rochester.
The shelter's clinic team brought Ashes out into the cat adoption center, where he was greeted by his owner Matthew, the woman who had found the small, lost cat and her friend to witness the incredible moment.

""It’s my Christmas miracle,"" Matthew said.

Ashes apparently leaped from his arms into the 18-wheeler he knew and perched himself in his rightful seat, with a new name tag, collar and harness courtesy of the Lollypop Farm crew.

""It’s that microchip – without it, I wouldn’t have ever gotten him back,"" Matthew said, according to Lollypop Farm. ""If you love your pet, you just have to chip them. The women that found him saved his life, but the microchip brought him home.""

Juvenile jail probed amid manhunt for escapees,https://abcnews.go.com/US/nashville-juvenile-detention-center-waited-35-minutes-call/story?id=67452994,"
Nashville police are investigating a privately operated juvenile detention center where four teens, including two accused of murder, were able to escape through the front door, police said Monday.

Youth Opportunity Investments, the private detention contractor that manages the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center, waited more than a half hour before it told police that the teens escaped, according to the Metro Nashville Police Department, which is investigating the circumstances surrounding Saturday night’s escape.

Two of the four teens, including one charged with murder, were found and rearrested on Tuesday night in Madison, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville.
""In 30 minutes, with a fast walk, you could be 2 miles away,"" Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson told reporters Monday. ""I don't have any indication that a crime has been committed, that there was some overt act to assist in their escape, but certainly a lot of gross negligence.""

Two murder suspects, including Morris Marsh, 17, who remains at large, allegedly ran out of the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center at around 10 p.m. Saturday night along with two other inmates. Brandon Caruthers, 17, remains on the run from the two escapees charged with lesser crimes, authorities said.

The teens were on a work detail when their staff supervisor left them to address a fight at another location inside the facility, according to police. They managed to get onto an elevator and used staff protocols to ride to the unsecured ground floor where they went through a series of doors and exited to the outside.

Authorities said an employee of the detention center drove around the area looking for the escapees for 35 minutes before he eventually called police for assistance.
Investigators said they more than likely had assistance once they were outside.

Youth Opportunity said it was conducting an internal investigation into how the teens managed to escape. It said four employees had been placed on suspension pending the results of the internal probe, according to Nashville ABC affiliate WKRN.

""Youth Opportunity has provided a safe and secure environment for the youth and the citizens of Nashville. Youth Opportunity has heretofore experienced very few safety and security breaches,"" the company said in a statement. ""Youth Opportunity acknowledges that several members of its security personnel made improper decisions that, when combined, led to an opportunity for the four youth to leave the facility.""

Anderson said he ""had more questions than I had answers"" after reviewing a copy of Youth Opportunity's internal report, which is why he requested an investigation.
""In looking at their own internal report, I just saw a pattern of people not paying attention to what they should be doing, so that's the reason that I called for the review,"" Anderson said.

""What I saw in their report appeared to be a pattern of maybe nonchalant behavior,"" Anderson said.

Authorities said the teens are considered dangerous and are asking for the public's help in locating them.

Marsh is suspected of killing 19-year-old Charles Easley in April.

Caruthers had been transferred to adult court on an August 2018 armed robbery case in south Nashville, according to police.

ABC News does not normally name juveniles, but are doing so because police said they are dangerous individuals and have released their names and photos. Anyone with information about the escapees is asked to immediately call Nashville's Emergency Communications Center at 615-862-8600.

Man dead for years identified in 1984 teen murder,https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-dead-years-identified-suspect-1984-murder-15/story?id=67465538,"
Decades after a teenage girl was stabbed to death at her grandparents' home, DNA and genetic genealogy have been used to identify her suspected killer -- a man dead for years.

On June 15, 1984, the body of 15-year-old Reesa Trexler was found nude in a bedroom at her grandparents' house in North Carolina, Salisbury Police Sgt. Travis Shulenberger said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Trexler had been stabbed multiple times, and her spinal cord was severed, Shulenberger said.
Semen from her unknown killer was recovered from her body, Shulenberger said, but the case went unsolved for decades.

In 2018, Trexler's sister went on the ""Dr. Phil"" show, which ""sparked new interest in the case,"" Shulenberger said.
Salisbury police detectives and state investigators conducted interviews, reviewed evidence, collected DNA samples and worked with crime labs to try to solve the case, Shulenberger said.

This year, it was the use of genetic genealogy that cracked the case.

Genetic genealogy compares unknown DNA evidence from a crime scene to public databases, which are populated by the DNA of family members who voluntarily upload their own.
Genetic genealogy has been called a ""game-changer"" in cracking cold cases. Since the arrest of the suspected ""Golden State Killer"" in April 2018, about 100 suspects have been identified through the technology, according to Parabon NanoLabs Chief Genetic Genealogist CeCe Moore, who worked on the Trexler case.
But as law enforcement agencies across the country ramp up the use of genetic genealogy, some are concerned the tool is an invasion of privacy to those who voluntarily submit their DNA to databases for family ancestry purposes.

When the DNA from the semen left on Trexler's body was uploaded to a public genetic database, Parabon genealogists reverse-engineered the suspect's family tree to determine possible suspects, police said.
Authorities narrowed down the family members to determine their suspect, who was in his 40s at the time of the crime.

The suspect, who was not named, died in 2007, said police.

With a court order, investigators exhumed the suspect’s body and determined that his DNA matched the suspect's semen from the crime scene.
""Fortunately, DNA science has come a long way since 1984,"" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said at Tuesday's news conference, calling it ""a powerful tool.""

Police previously had speculated Trexler's killer was a family member, but the suspect, who had a criminal history including assault with a deadly weapon, was not related and had no connection to the Trexler family, Shulenberger said.

Salisbury police Lt. Greg Beam said the department is not naming the suspect because he has no way of defending himself in a court of law.

Police now consider the case closed. No charges are expected.

""Nothing is going to bring Reesa back,"" Shulenberger said, ""but we have some closure to the case now."""

Erie County wrote on Facebook, ""PSA: If you happen to see a walnut sized/shaped egg mass, on your Christmas tree, don’t fret, clip the branch and put it in your garden. These are 100-200 preying mantis eggs!""

And for those who don't believe it ... a Virginia veterinarian experienced a nightmare last Christmas when dozens of praying mantises roamed her home.
More than 100 praying mantises hatched from an egg case hidden under the branches of the Christmas tree Springfield resident Molly Kreuze bought for the holiday season, ABC Washington D.C. affiliate WJLA reported.

The bugs moved freely through the house, ""crawling on the walls, crawling on the ceilings,"" Kreuze told the station, adding that they gravitated toward light. Video taken by WJLA showed the insects hanging from the ceiling and crawling on the windows.

This year, Kreuze planned on buying a fake one, she told the local station.

So if you haven't taken a close look at your tree, double check behind the bigger ornaments just in case!

Man who made Ice Bucket Challenge famous has died,https://abcnews.go.com/US/athlete-helped-ice-bucket-challenge-viral-died/story?id=67604713,"
Peter Frates, the man who championed the viral Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money to find a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has died.

""Peter Frates. A husband to Julie, a father to Lucy, a son to John and Nancy, a brother to Andrew and Jennifer, Pete passed away surrounded by his loving family, peacefully at age 34, after a heroic battle with ALS,"" according to a statement from the family on Monday. ""Pete was an inspiration to so many people around the world who drew strength from his courage and resiliency.""

In summer 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge flooded the internet, with people from Irish nuns to celebrities to entire pro sports teams filming themselves dumping buckets of ice water on their heads and then challenging their friends to do the same and donate money to research for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Frates, a young college athlete from suburban Massachusetts, helped make the challenge go viral after receiving his own ALS diagnosis.

Growing up outside Boston, Frates was a three sport all-star in high school. He was captain of the football and hockey teams, but baseball was his life’s passion.
He went on to play center field for Division I Boston College, and in his final year, Frates was named captain of the baseball team.

After a short stint playing professional ball overseas, Frates came back to Boston to start a job selling insurance and met the love of his life, Julie Frates. The two dreamed of marriage and children, but only six months after they started dating, Frates said he started feeling odd and having trouble with simple tasks like buttoning his shirt. After a series of tests, doctors asked him to come in -- and to bring his parents with him. Frates was diagnosed with ALS.
ALS is a rare neurological disease that robs patients of their movements, their voice and eventually, the ability to breath, all while the mind stays alert. Almost immediately after learning he had ALS, rather than wallowing, Frates started looking at the diagnosis as a dare. Ever the team captain, he took the reins of his disease from day one.

""Remarkably, Pete never complained about his illness. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to give hope to other patients and their families. In his lifetime, he was determined to change the trajectory of a disease that had no treatment or cure,"" his family said in the statement, shared by Boston College.

Frates launched a mission to raise money to find a cure. He also married Julie.
Two-and-a-half years into his diagnosis, Frates challenged ""hundreds of best friends,"" reaching into a network of athletes with massive social media followings, to give them 24 hours to dump an ice bucket over their heads or donate to ALS. Almost instantly, major athletes, including Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who went to Boston College, and Julian Edelman, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, were taking the challenge. Then it spread to include NBA giants Lebron James and Kevin Durant, and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Chris Pratt, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and dozens of others.

""As a result, through his determination -- along with his faithful supporters, Team Frate Train -- he championed the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In August of 2014, the historic movement pioneered social media fundraising and garnered donations globally that resulted in better access to ALS care, genetic discoveries, treatments and, someday, a cure.  He was a beacon of hope for all,"" the family's statement said.
In just six weeks, the Ice Bucket Challenge raised almost a quarter of a billion dollars. But as ALS research progressed, Frates' body continued to decline.
What Frates was able to prove, his family said previously, is that one person can change the world.

""On behalf of Julie, Lucy, John, Nancy, Jennifer and Andrew, along with his extended family and multitude of friends, we ask that you celebrate Pete and the hope that he has given to so many by following his daily affirmation: Be passionate, be genuine, be hardworking and don’t ever be afraid to be great,"" his family said. ""The Frates family wishes to express its sincere gratitude for the abundant love, kindness, and support we have been the recipients of during the past eight years.""

The family asked friends and supporter to consider making a donation to the Peter Frates Family Foundation, whose ""mission is to aid progressed ALS patients in their desire to stay at home with those who love them most.""

The Memorial Mass will be held at St. Ignatius Church at Boston College Friday at 11 a.m. and will be live-streamed. More details to follow, per Boston College.

Buffalo Bishop resigns following Vatican review,https://abcnews.go.com/US/buffalo-bishop-resigns-vatican-review-diocese/story?id=67489074,"
Bishop Richard Malone, the scandal-plagued spiritual leader of the Diocese of Buffalo, has resigned in the wake of widespread criticism of his handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by local clergy members.

His departure, announced via press release by the Vatican on Wednesday morning, follows a report on the troubled diocese authorized by the Holy See and submitted to the Vatican’s Congregation for Bishops in November.

""The Holy Father accepted the renunciation of the pastoral government of the diocese of Buffalo (U.S.A.), presented by S.E. Mons. Richard J. Malone,” reads the announcement when translated from from Italian, “and appointed Apostolic Administrator vacant seat of the same diocese S.E. Mons. Edward B. Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany.”

Malone is the first bishop in the 172-year history of the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to resign from office. In a statement released after the Vatican’s announcement, Malone acknowledged that his position had become untenable but continued to defend his legacy.

“Despite the measurable progress we have achieved together, I have concluded after much prayer and discernment that the spiritual welfare of the people of the Diocese of Buffalo will be better served by a new bishop who perhaps is better able to bring about the reconciliation, healing and renewal that is so needed,” Malone said in the statement. “As such, I requested of His Holiness Pope Francis that he permit me to retire early, and he agreed to do so. … It is my honest assessment that I have accomplished as much as I am able to, and that there remain divisions and wounds that I am unable to bind and heal.”

He insisted that while he “was made aware of the general conclusions of the report” to the Vatican, “my decision to retire early was made freely and voluntarily.”
Scharfenberger will take over the diocese immediately as a temporary administrator while the Vatican searches for a permanent replacement.

The Diocese of Buffalo has been in a state of crisis since last year, when Siobhan O'Connor, Malone's former personal secretary, leaked internal church documents to investigative reporter Charlie Specht from ABC's local station WKBW, sparking months of reporting about whether there had been efforts to conceal the extent of the problem from the public.

In an interview with ABC News that aired as a special edition of Nightline in July, Malone defended his leadership, including his decision to allow Fr. Dennis Riter, a local pastor who has faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, to return to ministry after a lawyer hired by the church to investigate the matter concluded the allegations had “no merit.” Riter has denied the accusations and continues to serve as pastor of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in the Buffalo suburb of Dunkirk.

“I feel that in the almost 20 years I have been a bishop, I’ve tried hard to be a good shepherd,” Malone told ABC News, arguing that he had “inherited a decades old horrific problem of abuse.”
But the crisis only deepened in September with the emergence of secret audio recordings, made by Malone’s then-secretary and diocesan vice chancellor Fr. Ryszard Biernat and obtained by both WKBW and ABC News.

The recordings suggest Malone sought to conceal allegations that an active priest had sexually harassed a then-seminarian, even though Malone can be heard on the tapes describing the accused priest as ""a sick puppy"" and calling his alleged penchant for manipulation and retaliation ""dangerous.""

Despite the ensuing public outrage and growing calls for his ouster from both religious and civic leaders, Malone initially appeared steadfast in his refusal to resign, suggesting the absence of action from the Vatican constituted an implicit endorsement of his leadership.

“They say the pope frequently picks up the phone and calls people around the world, but I have not been the recipient of one of these calls,” Malone said during an emergency briefing with a hand-picked group of reporters following the publication of the recordings. “I’ve had no communications from the pope at all.”

“I know for sure they're not unaware of all the news around here,” he continued. “But so far apparently I like to think they are trusting in my goodwill and my intention and my capacity working with other people to lead us further.”

That changed in October, when the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C., the Vatican's U.S. representative, announced that its office had authorized Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of the Diocese of Brooklyn to conduct an ""Apostolic Visitation,"" described as ""a fact-finding mission which reports directly to the Holy See … to evaluate situations in dioceses.”
Following the announcement of Malone’s resignation on Wednesday, DiMarzio released a statement on his review, saying that his team spoke with “more than 80 people over a period of several weeks” but giving no indication of whether or when its conclusions might be made public.

“What I found are many deeply devoted Catholics who love their Church,” DiMarzio said in a statement. “I pray this moment of suffering and pain will lead to a birth of new faith. With the appointment of the Most Reverend Edward Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany, to oversee the Buffalo Diocese, I am confident that Buffalo Catholics are in good hands. I hope that now Catholics in Buffalo can begin the process of moving forward, healing, and helping the diocese in all of its ministries.”

Malone’s critics largely viewed the news as a step in the right direction.

Matthew Golden, who has accused Malone of allowing Fr. Riter, his alleged abuser, to escape consequences, hailed the announcement as a “huge victory” for survivors of clergy abuse and their advocates.

“With the persistence and determination of a few individuals,” he told ABC News, “this glorious day in Buffalo has finally arrived. One done, Riter to go.”

Mitchell Garabedian, the famed Boston-based clergy abuse attorney who represents 38 alleged victims in Buffalo, including one of Fr. Riter’s other accusers, said Malone’s resignation sends a “loud message.”

“The resignation of Bishop Malone provides hope to clergy sexual abuse victims that morality will prevail, justice will be served and that their voices can and will create positive change,” Garabedian said in a statement. “The resignation sends a loud message to clergy sexual abuse victims to stand tall and be proud.”

And Siobhan O’Connor, the whistleblower who sparked the initial scandal, said she is relieved after what she described as a long struggle for survivors and the diocese.

""For me, this is a time not for rejoicing, but for relief,” O’Connor said, “The resignation of [Malone] is long overdue.”
But the future for Buffalo’s Catholic community remains unclear. Both the FBI and the New York Attorney General are currently investigating the diocese, and Malone’s successor could inherit a crisis, albeit more of a financial one, of his own.

According to The Buffalo News, the diocese was considering filing for bankruptcy as it faces dozens of new lawsuits brought against the diocese following New York’s opening of a one-year window outside the statute of limitations for new civil litigation from alleged victims of childhood sexual abuse.

In his introductory remarks to the media on Wednesday, Bishop Scharfenberger, the temporary administrator, stressed the need for a more “open and honest” approach.

“We can’t be afraid of reality,” Scharfenberger said. “We have to look at things with sober eyes and look at the damage that was done.”"
Thousands want criminal charges for deer attackers,https://abcnews.go.com/US/475000-people-sign-petition-bring-maximum-punishment-men/story?id=67497770,"
More than 475,000 people are petitioning for criminal charges to be brought against two young men who were seen assaulting an injured deer.

The online petition, which, at the time this story was published, was just a few thousand signatures short of its 500,000 goal but was growing by the second, wrote that ""charges need to be filed with maximum sentencing.""

A video that circulated on the internet -- allegedly showing two people kicking the deer in its face, stepping on it and ripping its antlers out in Pennsylvania -- prompted the petition. The video has since been removed from Facebook but images appear to show the attack.
A spokesperson with the Pennsylvania Game Commission told ABC News on Wednesday authorities are expecting to announce charges soon, but no arrests have been made.
He said he could not release details about the attackers or the area in which the assault took place.

He also would not say exactly what was seen in the video, but the commission on Sunday called it ""reprehensible and potentially a violation of the law,"" according to a statement.

The attack comes about a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that make animal cruelty a federal felony.
The bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, criminalizes certain acts of animal cruelty.

Anyone with information regarding the deer incident is asked to contact the Operation Game Thief Hotline at 1-888–PGC-8001 or the Game Commission’s Northwest Region Dispatch Office at 814-432-3187.

Woman denied morning-after pill by pharmacists: Lawsuit,https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-denied-morning-pill-pharmacists-beliefs-lawsuit/story?id=67683626,"
A woman in Minnesota is suing two pharmacies, including CVS, for sex discrimination after she claims she was denied a morning-after pill.

Andrea Anderson, a 39-year-old mother of five, said she was first refused the pill at her local pharmacy, Thrifty White Pharmacy in McGregor, according to a lawsuit filed in Minnesota’s Ninth Judicial District on Tuesday.

Anderson called in the prescription and just before she went to pick it up, she received a call from a pharmacist there who told her that he couldn't fill the prescription because of his ""personal beliefs,"" the lawsuit claims.

After complaining to the pharmacy's owner, Anderson claimed she was told that this was not the first time the pharmacist, who also serves as a local pastor, refused a prescription.

Yet her troubles didn't end there, she and her lawyers say.

When she tried a CVS that was located about 25 minutes away, she was allegedly told her prescription couldn't be filled there either.
The pharmacist at the CVS also tried to stop Anderson from obtaining it at a nearby Walgreens by allegedly telling her that they didn't have it in stock, the lawsuit claims.

Yet when Anderson called Walgreens ""to double check,"" she was told that the pharmacy did indeed have Ella and could fill her prescription.
The pharmacist at Walgreens also confirmed to Anderson that she had just spoken with someone at CVS and said as such, according to the lawsuit.

""The pharmacists I encountered ignored my health needs and my doctor's instructions,"" Anderson said in a statement.
""I could not believe this was happening. I was angry,"" she added.

CVS Pharmacy did not respond to ABC News' specific questions, but said in a statement they were ""reviewing and investigating the allegations made in the complaint.""

""CVS Pharmacy is committed to providing access to emergency contraception, whether it is at the pharmacy counter for patients who have a prescription for it, or in our store aisles where we have sold over-the-counter emergency contraception for several years,"" according to the statement.

A manager at the Thrifty White Pharmacy in McGregor told ABC News that the store had not yet been served, but declined to comment further.

Jess Braverman, the Legal Director at Gender Justice, the non-profit representing Anderson, condemned the pharmacist at Thrifty White, saying in a statement to ABC News that he ignored both his legal and ethical obligation.

Braverman hopes that the lawsuit will ""ensure that health care providers uphold their legal and ethical responsibilities to care for their patients, regardless of the providers’ personal beliefs.""

Man finally gets his Christmas song played on the radio after 54 years,https://abcnews.go.com/US/great-grandfather-finally-christmas-song-played-radio-54/story?id=67669437,"
While some Christmas lists might be filled with gifts like gadgets, game consoles and toys, one Texas man wanted only one thing for the holidays.

Johnny Gondesen, 83, of Cypress, Texas, hoped to hear a song that he'd made, which his family had played in his home for years, played everywhere for all to hear.

On Dec. 4, his wish came true, thanks to Houston radio station 104.1 KRBE's ""The Roula & Ryan Show.""
Gondesen, who played in a band when he was younger, was inspired in 1965 to write a song after hearing his children say ""ho, ho, ho"" whenever they saw Christmas trees.

He named the song ""Christmas Is Here.""
""I stayed up to 3 o'clock in the morning and I wrote the song, the words to it,"" he told Houston ABC affiliate KTRK-TV in November.

Gondesen recorded the song and even had records made. He also starred in a homemade music video, but the song never made it to the radio despite his multiple attempts.

""I would love the song to go all around the whole world, and all the children could hear it,"" he told KTRK-TV. ""I'm 83 now and I want something to happen to this song before, you know, I go meet my maker.""

This year, his children and grandchildren spread the word about his wish. There was a YouTube video as well as a story on KTRK-TV and a post on iTunes.
Finally, the family's message reached 104.1 KRBE in Houston. The station liked what it heard and invited Gondesen to hear his song played live on the radio.

Nearly 54 years after the great-grandfather had written and recorded the family song, he was able to see -- and hear -- his wish finally come true.

""It’s happened! How do you feel?"" the hosts asked him on Dec. 4 in a video that was posted to Instagram.

""I feel wonderful,"" he said."
George Zimmerman files $100M lawsuit against Trayvon Martin's family for defamation,https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-files-100m-lawsuit-trayvon-martins-family/story?id=67496989,"
George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and his lawyer have filed a $100 million lawsuit against prosecutors, Martin's family, their attorney and a book publisher for allegations that one of the trial's key witnesses was ""an imposter.""

Zimmerman's civil attorney Larry Klayman filed the multi-million lawsuit in Polk County Circuit Court in Florida.

Klayman alleges in the 36-page lawsuit that Martin's parents Sybrina Ford and Tracy Martin as well as their attorney Ben Crump falsely inserted Rachel Jeantel into the case after the Sanford Police Department closed the investigation in March 2012 as ""self-defense.""
The lawsuit claims then 18-year-old Jeantel was ""an imposter and fake witness"" and the catalyst to get Zimmerman arrested and charged with the murder of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was cleared of all charges after the weeks-long televised trial.

""Defendants, each and every one of them, as individuals and through their employment and agencies, have worked in concert to deprive Zimmerman of his constitutional and other related legal rights,"" according to the lawsuit.
Trayvon Martin was walking back to his father's house on Feb. 26, 2012, after purchasing Skittles and a beverage from a nearby 7-Eleven. The now 36-year-old Zimmerman, who is half white and Hispanic, testified at the murder trial that he was suspicious of 17-year-old Martin, who was walking in the Twin Lakes community wearing a hoodie and talking on a cellphone. Trayvon Martin was unarmed.
Klayman, who founded the nonprofit watchdog organization Judicial Watch, alleges that Jeantel's half-sister Brittany Diamond Eugene was actually on the phone during the deadly encounter and later ""coached"" Jeantel on how to testify, according to the lawsuit. He said these allegations partly stem from newly discovered evidence in the upcoming film ""The Trayvon Hoax: Unmasking the Witness Fraud that Divided America"" from director Joel Gilbert.
Crump responded to the lawsuit in a statement, saying, ""This tale defies all logic, and it’s time to close the door on these baseless imaginings. This plaintiff continues to display a callous disregard for everyone but himself, revictimizing individuals whose lives were shattered by his own misguided actions. He would have us believe that he is the innocent victim of a deep conspiracy, despite the complete lack of any credible evidence to support his outlandish claims.""

He added, “I have every confidence that this unfounded and reckless lawsuit will be revealed for what it is – another failed attempt to defend the indefensible and a shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others.""
Other named defendants in the lawsuit include Eugene, current and former Florida prosecutors Bernie de la Rionda, John Guy, Angela Corey, The State of Florida and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). Klayman alleges that all parties ""either have known about or should have known about the witness fraud, obstructed justice, or lied repeatedly under oath in order to cover up their knowledge of the witness fraud.""

HarperCollins Publishers LLC. was also named as a defendant for publishing Crump's book in October 2019 with defamatory claims against Zimmerman, according to the lawsuit.
FDLE has not been served the lawsuit, a spokesperson told ABC News. Request for comment from the other defendants were not immediately returned.

The Florida Bar criticized Klayman for posting the lawsuit on his website without redacting the addresses of the defendants and other charges, according to the complaint obtained by ABC News. Klayman has not returned ABC News' request for comment.
Since Zimmerman's acquittal, he has attempted to sell the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin, sold confederate artwork to raise money for a supposed ""Muslim free gun store"" and pleaded no contest for threatening and harassing a private investigator who reached out to him to see if he would participate in a film about the 2012 shooting.

Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, became a prominent member of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of her son’s death and has said that her son’s memory lives on as part of the movement along with several unarmed black people who were killed by law enforcement.

"Manhunt for alleged cop killer ends with arrest of suspect, mom and boyfriend",https://abcnews.go.com/US/blue-alert-issued-fugitive-allegedly-committed-fatal-hit/story?id=67683624,"
The two-day manhunt for a 21-year-old fatal hit-and-run driver, who allegedly killed a Texas sergeant during a traffic stop, ended on Thursday afternoon without incident.

Moments after Tavores Dewayne Henderson allegedly mowed down Nassau Bay Police Sgt. Kalia Sullivan on Tuesday evening, his mother and her boyfriend took him into hiding, prosecutors said at a press conference on Thursday evening.

Henderson bolted from a traffic stop on Tuesday evening when Sullivan and another officer attempted to arrest him for an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor assault allegedly against a family member. As officers went to make the arrest, Henderson allegedly resisted, got free, went back into the vehicle and drove off, knocking Sullivan to the ground, police said.
Sullivan, a 16-year veteran, was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. She was 43.
A manhunt ensued for Henderson, who was allegedly asleep inside a hotel nearby the 2000 block of San Sebastian Court crime scene, prosecutors said.

Meanwhile, Harris County police officers went to Henderson's mom's home seeking her son's whereabouts and ""she lied,"" prosecutors said.
The mom, who authorities have not identified, was seen on surveillance video -- 30 minutes prior to telling the alleged lie -- dropping off Henderson at the hotel, prosecutors said.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez posted a tweet during the search efforts, warning anyone aiding a fugitive that they will be prosecuted.

""I made it crystal clear that if you are hindering apprehension of a fugitive you will be charged ... we are not playing around with that,"" said Gonzalez at the press conference.

Henderson's mom and her boyfriend were arrested and are charged with hindering prosecution, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said at the press conference. The boyfriend's identity was not released by authorities.

As the search for Henderson continued on Wednesday, a $20,000 reward was offered for his arrest and a ""Blue Alert"" was issued when Henderson was allegedly spotted in Missouri City, Texas, heading to Louisiana with a man identified as ""Anthony.""

The Harris County Police Department announced on social media Thursday that Henderson was ""taken into custody without incident"" from a home on the 4200 block of Heritage Trail Drive in Houston, Texas.Tavores Dewayne Henderson - suspect in the felony murder of Nassau Bay Police Sgt.

""His demeanor was cooperative. We had no problems with him as we got him in to custody,"" police said.

Ogg said that Henderson is being charged with capital murder.

Henderson allegedly made a full confession to police on Thursday and could not explain why he did not stop the car when Sullivan was ""hanging partially out,"" police said.

The Nassau Bay Police Department mourned their fallen officer at a candlelight vigil on Wednesday evening, local affiliate ABC13 reported. Sullivan was a resident of Friendswood, Texas, and  the national president of the Sisters Eternal Woman's Motorcycle Club of Texas.

21-year-old on raising 5 siblings after parents' death: 'I became their adult',https://abcnews.go.com/US/21-year-opens-raising-siblings-parents-death-adult/story?id=67597151,"
Samantha Rodriguez, 21, opened up to ""The View"" about taking on the roles of mom and dad to her five siblings after both parents died from cancer.

The eldest sibling of the Rodriguez family was only 17 years old when her mother and father died from cancer. Now 21, she's spent the last few years providing for her four little sisters and her little brother as no one else in the family has the means to take them in.

Their mother, Lisa Smith, died from cervical cancer in 2013 leaving their father Alexander Rodriguez to take care of the family. However, he fell ill with what turned out to be lymphoma. He died three years later.
Now, Destiny, 7; Bella, 9; Michael, 12; Brenda, 15; and Milagros, 16, look to their eldest sister to not only provide for them, but be their role model as well.

""My reality [was] I'm 17 but these are my brothers and sisters, and when I looked at them, I knew that they're children,"" Rodriguez said. ""They're vulnerable and they need an adult, so I became their adult.""

When they're home in Orlando, Florida, Samantha is responsible for daily tasks, such as providing meals, taking her siblings to school, doctor's appointments, sports practices and helping with homework. While handling the kids and household, she also goes to college part-time and waitresses.

Despite the hardships she and her family have faced, she's taken it on with a positive outlook.

""I get a lot of that strength from my mother,"" Rodriguez said. ""I spent a lot of time with her and I admired her so much.""

""When we lost her, I knew that I wanted to be just like her in every way,"" she added. ""That's what I wanted to do for the kids.""

Milagros Rodriguez said her older sister ""gave up basically her life to take care of us"" and that ""Sam is a mom and a dad to us.""

""I try to give them the love that they need and the support they need, and I try to do it for two,"" said Samantha Rodriguez.
Samantha Rodriguez says she tries to set the best example possible for her siblings, including some lessons she learned from her parents.

""They showed us not to take anything for granted. That's something I try to teach the kids,"" Samantha Rodriguez said.

""At the end of the day, the material things don't matter. What's given can be taken away so fast,"" she added. ""The only thing that really matters is family and love and support.""

Samantha Rodriguez helped take care of her parents when they fell ill, even dropping out of school to find the time. After their deaths, she returned to school to earn her high school diploma, saying she wanted to show her siblings the importance of an education.

""I didn't know people who graduated high school or went college, and I didn't have that direction so it was hard for me,"" Samantha said. ""When I realized that I wanted the kids to finish and that I wanted them to be successful, I was like I need to give them that example and show them.""

""This is what makes me, me,"" Samantha Rodriguez said caring for her siblings at such a young age. ""It makes me so happy to be with them and to be there for them. It's very enjoyable for me.""

'Varsity Blues' ringleader tried to recruit 7 Stanford coaches: Investigation,https://abcnews.go.com/US/varsity-blues-ringleader-recruit-stanford-coaches-investigation/story?id=67489718,"
An external investigation commissioned by Stanford University found that the ringleader of the nationwide ""Operation Varsity Blues"" college admission scam tried to lure seven of the Northern California school's coaches into the scheme, but only one took the bait.

In a letter to the Stanford community, university President Marc Tessier-Lavigne said the investigation by a private law firm found that fraudulent actions in the school's athletic admissions were limited to its former head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who has pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal.

""We commissioned this review to identify any fraudulent actions in athletic admissions that had not already been identified at Stanford and to strengthen our internal controls in order to assure the integrity of our systems at the intersection of admissions and athletics,"" Tessier-Lavigne wrote in the letter.
He said the probe, by the New York law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, found that William ""Rick"" Singer, the college admissions consultant who mastermind the years-long scam, contributed $770,000 to the university, most of it to the sailing program.

Tessier-Lavigne said the money will be redistributed to organizations helping financially strapped high school students prepare for college admission.

Federal prosecutors announced in March that 50 wealthy people, including Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and a slew of chief executives, were charged in the largest college cheating scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Those indicted in the investigation allegedly paid bribes of up to $6.5 million to Singer to get their children into elite colleges, including Stanford, Yale, Princeton, Georgetown and the University of Southern California, federal prosecutors said.
Singer, who owned a college counseling service called Key Worldwide Foundation and a company called Edge College & Career Network, accepted bribes totaling $25 million from parents between 2011 and 2018 ""to guarantee their children's admission to elite schools,"" federal prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said Singer bribed several coaches at multiple universities into helping him get students from wealthy families into their schools by saying they were recruits for sports teams despite most having never participated in organized athletics in high school.

Singer pleaded guilty in a Boston federal court in March to charges of racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice. He has yet to be sentenced.

""Singer directly or indirectly approached seven Stanford coaches about potential recruits between 2009 and 2019,"" Tessier-Lavigne said in his letter. ""The review found no evidence that any employee of Stanford Athletics other than the former head sailing coach agreed to support a Singer client in exchange for a financial consideration.""

Vandemoer, 42, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. He was sentenced in June in Boston federal court to six months of home detention and two years of supervised release. He also was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Tessier-Lavigne said the law firm that conducted the external probe for the university interviewed more than 55 people and reviewed more than 35,000 records.

The two students for whom Vandemoer accepted bribes were never admitted to Stanford.
The university also rescinded the admission of another student caught up in the scam who included false information on an admission application, Tessier-Lavigne said. That student was not associated with Vandemoer's case.

In addition to conducting the external probe for Stanford, the law firm recommended several steps the university could take to fortify its admissions process against fraud.
Among the recommendations were:

• Adopt a formal written policy codifying the school's approach to donations and athletic recruits

• Require the school's development officers to independently verify the source and purpose of donations to the athletic department

• Require coaches to flag to the admissions and office of development athletic recruits associated with third-party recruiters or consultants

Other recommendations include enhancing training for coaches on the school's fundraising process and clarifying that fundraising results are not considered part of a coach’s performance evaluation.

""Stanford embraces these recommendations and will be moving swiftly to implement them,"" Tessier-Lavigne said. ""Taken together, these steps provide for clearer policies, more training, fuller communication and stronger vetting that will serve as a bulwark against fraudulent efforts in the future."""

The Minnesota National Guard and local emergency services are currently trying to determine the location and status of the aircraft. The helicopter had three Minnesota National Guard personnel on board.
Information about the helicopter's flight destination was not immediately available, Army Col. Joe Sharkey, director of communications for the Minnesota National Guard, told ABC News after the helicopter was reported missing.

Army Safety Center investigators from Fort Rucker in Alabama were expected to arrive at the scene on Friday, Walz said. Chief Deputy Dan Miller of the Stearns County Sheriff's Office said the crash site was not close to any homes.
The St. Paul Fire Department said in a tweet on Thursday afternoon that it had deployed a rescue squadron following reports of the missing aircraft.

In September, one soldier was killed and three others were injured during an Army helicopter accident at the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk training area in Louisiana.
A spokesperson for Fort Polk told ABC News at the time that the helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk medevac unit comprised of four soldiers that crashed while en route to pick up another soldier needing treatment for heat-related symptoms.
It was unclear what caused that crash, but the spokesperson said that the weather was clear and the helicopter did not strike power lines.

Then in November, two Apache pilots were killed during a helicopter crash in eastern Afghanistan. Initial indications were that the helicopter was not brought down by enemy fire.

Philip Glass to write new orchestral work in honor of news anchor Peter Jennings,https://abcnews.go.com/US/philip-glass-write-orchestral-work-honor-news-anchor/story?id=67679791,"
Peter Jennings, the ABC News journalist whose voice was known to millions, will be honored by a new work from composer Philip Glass, whose music is known throughout the world.

Glass has been commissioned by Canada's National Arts Centre (NAC) to create a new orchestral piece in honor of the Canadian-born Jennings, who died of lung cancer in 2005 at the age of 67.
The new piece will be an ""ode to freedom of the press"" that is ""developed around the theme of truth in our times,"" according to NAC officials.

""Philip Glass ranks among the most influential composers of our time, and is a unique and bold artist who has long explored themes of truth, honesty and justice through his work,"" said NAC Music Director Alexander Shelley. ""It is a thrill and a privilege that he will be creating a new piece for Canada’s National Arts Centre Orchestra, honouring Peter Jennings’ legacy and scrutinizing a theme which has never seemed more important or relevant.""
Glass, whose music is known for its repetitive structure, has composed numerous scores for film and television, including a documentary hosted by Jennings years ago. His work was performed by the NAC Orchestra in 2016 after he received the Glenn Gould Prize for contributions to the arts.

""I was very impressed by the NAC Orchestra when receiving the Glenn Gould Prize, and was excited to receive this commission from them to honour the person, work and ethos of Peter Jennings, on a theme which is very close to my heart,"" Glass said.
Jennings began reporting for ABC News in 1964 and was named anchor and senior editor of ABC's ""World News Tonight"" in 1983.

Over his long career he won 16 Emmy Awards, two George Foster Peabody Awards, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and several Overseas Press Club Awards.
