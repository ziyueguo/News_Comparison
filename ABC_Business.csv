California recovers $23M from auto parts makers' bid rigging,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/california-recovers-23m-auto-parts-makers-bid-rigging-67500736,"
California has recovered more than $23 million from settlements with 52 automobile parts manufacturers for illegal bid rigging that jacked up consumer costs, state Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Wednesday.
The parts makers suppressed competition by conspiring to fix prices in automobile manufacturers' requests for bids, Becerra said.
“Those rigged bids and prices that were fixed affected many vehicles, both foreign and domestic models, and they created a less competitive marketplace and consequently higher prices for consumers.” Becerra said, noting that more than 22 million vehicles are registered in California.
The state's largest such settlement, $4.25 million, was reached this week with DENSO Corp., though some settlements with other companies date to 2015. 
DENSO is based in Kariya, Japan, but operates in 35 countries. It did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday, but said in the settlement that it admits no wrongdoing and is settling to avoid expensive litigation.
The damages are to recover the higher costs paid by California state agencies, but Becerra noted that the parts makers also face class-action lawsuits on behalf of automobile dealers and buyers.
A settlement website cited by Becerra,         http://www.autopartsclass.com/ , says auto buyers could each be eligible for $100 or more in restitution from those private class-action lawsuits, but must apply by year's end.
The state's settlements piggyback on a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice that began in 2010. Forty-two companies have pleaded guilty to federal price-fixing charges and agreed to pay nearly $3 billion in fines. DENSO, for instance, agreed to a $78 million federal fine in 2012.
California was one of only two states to separately seek damages, along with Florida, which Becerra’s office said helped support consumers’ class-action lawsuits. "
"Small business hiring slow, likely to remain so, reports say",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/small-business-hiring-slow-remain-reports-67599420,"
Two reports last week show that small business hiring still lags behind the strong job growth reported at larger companies, and that owners are unlikely to increase their staffs significantly in 2020.
Payroll processor ADP said its customers with up to 49 employees added 11,000 jobs in November, one of the weakest showings this year. ADP's numbers are often revised, but the November count followed a trend; it was preceded by gain of 12,000 in October and a still-weak 39,000 in September.
The ADP report is not always in sync with other measures of employment including the Labor Department's monthly report. While ADP reported that its business customers of all sizes added just 67,000 jobs in November, the government said Friday private sector jobs grew by 200,000. But ADP's tally over time has reflected the slower growth of jobs among smaller companies that economists have seen. According to ADP's count, small businesses have added an average of 26,000 workers each month this year, down from a monthly average of 52,000 in all of 2018. 
Seventy percent of the new jobs in November came from mid-sized firms, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, who analyzes ADP's data.
Small businesses have reported for several years that they've been unable to find qualified candidates for their job openings. That's a problem large companies also face, but they have an advantage over smaller employers because they're able to offer higher salaries and more attractive benefits, putting the smaller players at a disadvantage in recruiting and retention. Many small businesses are also conservative about hiring, and don't take on new staffers until they already have the revenue to justify the added expense and risk of expanding their payrolls.
A quarterly survey released last week by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and MetLife showed that owners are sticking to their cautious hiring. Twenty-eight percent of the 1,000 companies surveyed in September and October plan to add to their staffs, down marginally from 29% in a survey taken during the third quarter. Other surveys have also shown that about 30% of small businesses plan to hire. 
The Chamber of Commerce and MetLife found that small businesses that provide professional services have significantly scaled back their plans to hire; 20% expect to add jobs, compared to 30% in the third quarter. Thirty-one percent of small manufacturers plan to hire, down slightly from 32% in the third quarter. More retailers plan to hire — 28% reported they expected to add employees, up from 23% in the previous survey.

T-Mobile-Sprint antitrust trial begins in New York,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/state-ags-head-off-mobile-sprint-deal-court-67590007,"
An antitrust suit aimed at blocking T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint opened Monday in a crowded courtroom in New York with testimony from Sprint executives that touched on the consumer benefits of the company's competition with T-Mobile and other carriers.
A group of 14 state attorneys general, led by New York and California, aim to convince a federal judge that the $26.5 billion deal should be blocked. T-Mobile has already         notched approvals from key federal regulators, setting up an unusual situation where states officials are seeking to overturn their federal counterparts. 
The trial, in U.S. District Court in New York, is expected to last several weeks. 
If T-Mobile prevails, the number of major U.S. wireless companies would shrink to three from four. A combined T-Mobile-Sprint would become a fiercer competitor to larger Verizon and AT&T . But the states argue that having one fewer mobile carrier would reduce competition and cost Americans billions of dollars in higher phone bills.
T-Mobile and Sprint provide cheaper alternatives to Verizon and AT&T, and T-Mobile has branded itself the “Un-carrier,” one that has made consumer-friendly changes such as bringing back unlimited-data plans and shattering two-year service contracts. There are concerns that less competition would put an end to these types of changes, although T-Mobile says that won’t happen.
The states' lawyers on Monday questioned Roger Sole, Sprint’s chief marketing officer, and Angela Rittgers, the senior vice president for sales and marketing for Sprint’s prepaid brands, Boost and Virgin. Their aim: Demonstrate that Sprint and T-Mobile competed with each other for customers by cutting prices and bringing unlimited plans back to the wireless market, benefiting consumers. 
In one example, they showed an email from former Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure to Sole, saying Sprint had to match a buy-one-get-one-free offer from T-Mobile for the iPhone 8. “We have no choice,” Claure said. 
T-Mobile, which promised not to raise prices for three years, defends its deal as good for competition. It repeats previous arguments that the combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be able to build a         better 5G network — a priority for the Trump administration — than either company could manage on its own.
The states, however, showed that at least one executive seemed to think the merger could drive up prices for consumers. During the questioning of Sole on Monday, attorneys presented messages he sent to Claure in October 2017, during merger negotiations, that posited that customer prices could rise an average $5 per user because of the deal.
Sole also wrote that prices could rise at AT&T and Verizon in a three-company wireless market. On the witness stand, Sole said he was just presenting a hypothetical and that he did no formal analysis to arrive at the $5 number.
The deal got the nod from both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, thanks to T-Mobile’s unusual commitment to create a brand-new mobile carrier in a deal with satellite-TV company Dish.
T-Mobile agreed to sell millions of customers to Dish and to rent its network to the fledgling rival while it built its own. Absent that arrangement, the Justice Department said, the deal would have been bad for consumers. Dish would start providing cellphone service after buying Sprint’s current prepaid-service business. Dish is also required to build a         faster, next-generation network, known as 5G, over the next several years.
The states says the Dish fix isn’t good enough. In a court filing, lawyers argued that T-Mobile and Sprint shouldn’t be allowed to combine “based on the hope that Dish will one day grow into a viable wireless company equal to a competitor that already exists today.”
Although it’s unusual for states to try to block a deal already approved by the federal government, experts note that states in recent years have been playing a bigger role in antitrust enforcement. They have gone after         generic drug makers and         hit tech companies with their own investigations.
“The states have going for them a pretty clear, straightforward application of the antitrust laws,” said Jeffrey Blattner, a former Justice Department official who now teaches at the University of Colorado. “The states have the wind at their back in terms of the law. How the facts play out, we’ll find out in the courtroom.”
Dish, a satellite TV company with a shrinking customer base, has spent about $21 billion over a decade buying wireless spectrum, the airwaves for transmitting data and calls, although the company hasn’t done much with it. Analysts have long questioned whether Dish intends to build its own network or simply profit by selling the spectrum to others. Post-deal, Dish faces up to $2.2 billion in fines if it fails to create a 5G network that serves 70% of the country by 2023.
Some analysts have said that Dish has potential as a viable competitor, but others say it will have a lot of challenges.
Dish must “start from scratch,” said Nicholas Economides, a New York University business school professor who joined six economists         in criticizing the Dish settlement as inadequate to make up for the loss of Sprint.
T-Mobile and Sprint say that a freestanding Sprint is weak and getting weaker. Sprint’s network quality is worse than its rivals’, and it has been losing customers, limiting its ability to invest in network improvements. T-Mobile CEO John Legere has insisted that Dish, even starting from scratch, will be more formidable than Sprint.
Legere, the face of T-Mobile and the rare telecom executive whose name may be known to the public because of his tendency to post videos and GIFs on social media, is         stepping down as CEO next spring.
He and his replacement, T-Mobile President and Chief Operating Officer Michael Sievert, have said they are confident that T-Mobile will prevail, but add that the company will be fine even if it isn’t allowed to buy Sprint.
“All roads lead to success,” Legere said during a call with analysts in mid-November.
T-Mobile has consistently shown that it would be OK without Sprint, said Craig Moffett, a well-known telecom analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. But the company would still need to figure out a new strategy for creating a strong 5G network without Sprint’s spectrum.
Both Legere and Sievert are expected to testify later this week. Questioning of Deutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Höttges began Monday. Deutsche Telekom, a Germany company, is T-Mobile's majority shareholder. "
"Huawei calls FCC's order 'unlawful,' takes new legal action",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/huawei-fights-back-court-fcc-order-ban-government/story?id=67515475,"
Chinese tech giant Huawei is not backing down from an ongoing battle with U.S. regulators by taking new legal action on Thursday against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over an order it calls ""unlawful.""

Huawei filed a court petition to overturn an FCC order from November that bans wireless carriers in rural America from purchasing Huawei equipment through a government subsidy fund known as the Universal Service Fund (USF).

The FCC has previously argued the order was imposed because Huawei poses a potential national security threat.
Huawei fought back, saying in a new statement that the FCC's order is ""unlawful on the grounds that it fails to offer Huawei required due process protections in labelling Huawei as a national security threat.""
""Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China -- this does not solve cyber security challenges,” Song Liuping, Huawei’s chief legal officer said at a news conference.
""Huawei also submitted 21 rounds of detailed comments, explaining how the order will harm people and businesses in remote areas,"" he added. ""The FCC ignored them all.""

Liuping accused the FCC of shutting down ""joint efforts to connect rural communities in the U.S.""
Glen Nager, an attorney for Huawei, added that the FCC has ""has no national security expertise,"" and it is not in their authority to label Huawei as a threat.

""The designation is simply shameful prejudgment of the worst kind,” said Nager at the news conference.

The FCC did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Thursday.

Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai wrote in an October blog post announcing the order to block USF funds from being used to purchase Huawei equipment that ""we simply can't take a risk"" when it comes to national security.

""I’m circulating an order that would prohibit the use of Universal Service Fund dollars to purchase equipment or services from any company -- like Huawei -- that poses a national security threat,"" Pai said. ""Going forward, we simply can’t take a risk when it comes to our networks and hope for the best.""

In November, after the order was adopted, Pai said the agency took these actions based on ""longstanding concerns from the executive and legislative branches about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment manufacturers,"" in a statement.

Pai added that Huawei has ""close ties to China’s Communist government and military apparatus"" and is ""subject to Chinese laws broadly obligating them to cooperate with any request from the country’s intelligence services and to keep those requests secret.""

""Moreover, we know that hidden 'backdoors' to our networks in routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow a hostile adversary to inject viruses and other malware, steal Americans’ private data, spy on U.S. companies, and more,"" Pai wrote.

United buying 50 Airbus jets to replace older Boeing planes,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/united-buying-50-airbus-jets-replace-older-boeing-67476574,"
United Airlines will replace some of its older Boeing planes with 50 new Airbus jets starting in 2024.
Chicago-based United announced Tuesday that it placed an order for Airbus A321XLR jets, a long-range version of the European company’s single-aisle A321neo. They will eventually replace United’s 53 Boeing 757-200s.
Terms weren’t released. United also will delay delivery of larger Airbus A350s.
The decision is a setback for Boeing, which is also based in Chicago and is reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max jets after two deadly crashes.
United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella says the Max doesn’t have the range of the A321XLR and Boeing hasn’t decided whether to build a new mid-size plane.
He says United will use the Airbus jets mostly between the East Coast and Europe."

Italian bank UniCredit plans to reduce 8,000 jobs under a three-year plan that aims to increase shareholder value.
The bank, Italy’s largest by assets, said Tuesday that the bank’s net profit will grow to 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) by 2023, from a forecast 4.7 billion euros in 2019, with earnings per share rising 12% per year.
The bank also plans to return 8 billion euros in value to shareholders through share buybacks, which will reduce its market exposure and increase the value of shares traded, and dividends, which will increase by 40% in the period.
CEO Jean Pierre Mustier said that the plan would increase stakeholder value by 16 billion euros.
UniCredit aims to close 500 branches, putting the customer focus on “streamlined processes and innovative products,” it said."
Ex-Bumble Bee CEO convicted in tuna price-fixing conspiracy,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bumble-bee-ceo-convicted-tuna-price-fixing-conspiracy-67476027,"
The former CEO of Bumble Bee Foods was convicted Tuesday for his part in a canned tuna price-fixing conspiracy involving the industry's top three companies, federal prosecutors said.
A jury in San Francisco found Christopher Lischewski guilty after a four-week trial, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a release. He had pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors said Lischewski conspired with others in the industry to eliminate competition by setting prices for canned tuna from November 2010 until December 2013.
Lischewski's attorney, John Keker, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bumble Bee Foods itself agreed to pay a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to price fixing in 2017.
Lischewski supervised his subordinates’ participation in the conspiracy, prosecutors said.
In September a federal judge ordered Pennsylvania-based StarKist Co. to pay a $100 million fine for its role in the collusion that also included Chicken of the Sea.
StarKist last year agreed to plead guilty to a felony price-fixing charge.
One former StarKist executive and two from Bumble Bee also each pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges. All three testified at Lischewski’s trial.
The scheme came to light when Thai Union Group's Chicken of the Sea attempt to buy San Diego-based Bumble Bee failed in 2015, according to court records.
Chicken of the Sea executives then alerted federal investigators, who agreed to shield the company from criminal prosecution in exchange for cooperation.
The three companies face lawsuits from wholesalers, food service companies and retailers."

Elon Musk tells jurors insult provoked ‘pedo guy’ tweet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tesla-ceo-musk-facing-defamation-trial-pedo-guy-67454383,"
Elon Musk testified Tuesday that he was being insulting, not literally calling a British cave diver a pedophile when he lashed out on Twitter and ended up in a defamation lawsuit from the man who helped rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from a flooded Thailand cave last year.
The Tesla CEO told jurors that he called Vernon Unsworth “pedo guy” because he was upset the spelunker had belittled his efforts to build a mini-submarine to transport the boys to safety. The sub was never used and Unsworth called it nothing more than a “PR stunt” and said Musk could stick the craft “where it hurts.”
“It was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,” the billionaire said in federal court in Los Angeles. “It was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.”
Unsworth’s lawyers argue that Musk’s tweet overshadowed what should have been one of the diver’s proudest moments and left him no choice but to sue.
At the time, Musk said he didn’t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue. He said his tweet wasn’t asserted as a fact.
“Just as I felt he didn’t mean to sodomize me with a submarine, I likewise didn’t think (“pedo guy”) required any clarification,” Musk said. “I will say it again, I apologize to Mr. Unsworth.”
Unsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.
Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said earlier that Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called “joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.”
The shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.
Musk deleted the July 15, 2018, tweets and apologized on Twitter, though subsequent statements he made have called into question what he meant.
In an email to a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth’s lawyer, Musk wrote the journalist “should stop defending child rapists,” followed by expletives.
Musk maintained his composure throughout an afternoon of questioning from Unsworth’s lawyer, who called him as his first witness.
Dressed in a charcoal suit and white shirt, Musk calmly answered the questions and slipped in an occasional droll remark that drew snickers from jurors and the gallery.
When asked about the final line of his email to the Buzzfeed reporter that said he hoped Unsworth would sue him, Musk quipped: “I guess be careful what you wish for.”
Throughout the testimony, he didn’t back down from his assertion that he didn’t mean pedophile in his tweet, saying it was only meant as “creepy old man” where he grew up in South Africa, though he said the phrase was widely used across the English language.
Unsworth’s lawyers laughed off that explanation, saying Musk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile with another tweet that said, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”
Musk also made a crack about that tweet, joking that it was a “very high stakes situation.”
“If I really thought that it was true, I would have said more than a dollar,” he testified.
Musk admitted one of his staffers tried to enlist a man to dig up dirt on Unsworth, but the investigator turned out to be a con man who got $52,000 for his efforts and produced nothing damning about Unsworth.
The lawsuit is not the first time Musk’s tweets have landed him in hot water.
Musk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year over allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. He agreed in the settlement to have future tweets about the company screened.
He went back to court on accusations he violated that agreement by tweeting a misleading figure about how many cars Tesla would manufacture this year. The SEC sought to hold him in contempt of court, which led to a new agreement imposing tighter controls on Musk's tweets about the company.

United CEO Oscar Munoz to step down,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/united-ceo-oscar-munoz-step-67515521,"
United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz is stepping down from his post and will become executive chairman.
The airline said Thursday that President J. Scott Kirby will be its new CEO. Kirby was recruited to United Airlines by Munoz in August 2016, after a three-decade career in the commercial airline business.
Munoz will become executive chairman in May 2020. He will serve in that role for a year.
United's current chairman, Jane Garvey, will retire from the board in May. She will have served in the position for two years. 
""With United in a stronger position than ever, now is the right time to begin the process of passing the baton to a new leader,"" Munoz said in a statement.
Munoz led the company through a choppy period, and in 2017 gave up his bonus after the forcible removal of a ticketed passenger led to widespread criticism. 
A few years ago, United lagged its closest competitors by many financial and operational measures. It has since reduced delays and cancellations and boosted margins. Since early last year, United has grown aggressively in Chicago, Denver and other places, adding flights between hub airports and smaller cities.
It had been rumored that Kirby was being considered for the top job at rival American Airlines, which has suffered a 15% decline in its shares this year. 
Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc., based in Chicago, are up 5% this year. The stock rose slightly before the opening bell. "
NATO downplays divisions as infighting roils alliance,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nato-downplays-divisions-infighting-roils-alliance-67487011,"
NATO leaders sought Wednesday to paper over their differences on an array of issues, such as the military alliance’s future priorities, but insisted they would respond as one in the event of any attack on any 29 member countries.
In their closing communique to a summit just north of London, the leaders also announced that they would set up a commission of experts to study NATO’s political decision making. That appears to be a direct response to the recent lament from French President Emmanuel Macron of a “brain death” in the trans-Atlantic military alliance.
“We stand together, all for one and one for all,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after meeting at a luxury hotel and golf resort. “Our commitment to Article 5, the collective defense clause of our alliance, is iron-clad.”
Ahead of the summit, Macron had complained about a lack of U.S. leadership. President Donald Trump branded his remarks as “very disrespectful,” while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Macron himself was “brain dead.”
The infighting is mostly due to Turkey’s offensive in northern Syria, which began in October. Macron has complained that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of the region without warning his NATO allies; a move that Turkey saw as a greenlight to send its troops in.
Countries across the European Union are particularly concerned as to what may transpire. The worry in many EU capitals is that some extremist fighters escaped during Turkey’s offensive, and that the fighting could spark a new wave of refugees.
To help ease tensions, leaders agreed to “a forwarding-looking reflection process” to be led by Stoltenberg. Details were sketchy, but the commission, “drawing on relevant expertise,” would study ways “to further strengthen NATO’s political dimension including consultation.”
Germany and France had both put forward similar schemes, although Macron riled many allies with his pre-summit remarks and NATO officials have pointedly suggested that they were more impressed by Berlin’s proposal.
After three summits in consecutive years, the leaders decided that they would take a year off and meet again in 2021. That means there won’t be another one until after the next presidential election in the United States, which is by far NATO’s most powerful and influential member country.
Earlier, summit host Prime Minister Boris Johnson — also busy with a divisive British election campaign — was one of many leaders who played down the organization’s differences.
“Clearly it is very important that the alliance stays together, but there is far, far more that unites us than divides us,” Johnson said.
He said NATO’s success is due to “the very simple concept of safety in numbers. At the heart of it is a pledge that we will come to one another’s defense: all for one and one for all.""
Erdogan didn’t speak to waiting media. Trump arrived via a different entrance, away from media and said he would leave without holding a press conference.
In a tweet, he said: “We won’t be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!”
Macron refused to apologize for his remarks, saying they had ignited a debate at NATO about important strategic issues.
“It’s allowed us to raise fundamental debates,” he said, chief among them being “how to build sustainable peace in Europe.”
He said NATO “debates should be about other things than budgets and finances.”
Stoltenberg noted that European allies and Canada have added $130 billion to their defense spending since 2016, even as Trump has complained that they are too slow to boost their military budgets.
“This is unprecedented, this is making us stronger,” Stoltenberg said of the spending effort.
After Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO countries halted their post-Cold War spending cuts and began to raise spending. They pledged to “move toward” spending 2% of their annual GDP on national defense by 2024.
Trump said Tuesday that much more needs to be done.
“You could make the case that they’ve been delinquent for 25-30 years,” Trump said. The figure of 2%, he added, “is a very low number, it really should be 4.”
Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel conceded that “we have experienced easier times. But we’re allies after all and we’re going to speak about everything.”
“The atmosphere last night was much more relaxed than what I expected after hearing what had happened over the last 24 hours. But I think differences can arise. We just have to talk about them,” Bettel said, referring to receptions late Tuesday at Buckingham Palace and at Downing Street."
Climate scientists try to cut their own carbon footprints,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/climate-scientists-cut-carbon-footprints-67576958,"
For years, Kim Cobb was the Indiana Jones of climate science. The Georgia Tech professor flew to the caves of Borneo to study ancient and current climate conditions. She jetted to a remote South Pacific island to see the effects of warming on coral.
Add to that flights to Paris, Rome, Vancouver and elsewhere. All told, in the last three years, she’s flown 29 times to study, meet or talk about global warming.
Then Cobb thought about how much her personal actions were contributing to the climate crisis, so she created a spreadsheet. She found that those flights added more than 73,000 pounds of heat-trapping carbon to the air.
Now she is about to ground herself, and she is not alone. Some climate scientists and activists are limiting their flying, their consumption of meat and their overall carbon footprints to avoid adding to the global warming they study.         Cobb will fly just once next year, to attend a massive international science meeting in Chile.
“People want to be part of the solution,” she said. “Especially when they spent their whole lives with their noses stuck up against” data showing the problem.
The issue divides climate scientists and activists and plays out on social media. Texas Tech’s         Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist who flies once a month, often to talk to climate doubters in the evangelical Christian movement, was blasted on Twitter because she keeps flying.
Hayhoe and other still-flying scientists note that aviation is only 3% of global carbon emissions.
Jonathan Foley, executive director of the climate solutions think-tank         Project Drawdown, limits his airline trips but will not stop flying because, he says, he must meet with donors to keep his organization alive. He calls flight shaming “the climate movement eating its own.”
Over the next couple of weeks, climate scientists and environmental advocates will fly across the globe. Some will be jetting to Madrid for United Nations climate negotiations. Others, including Cobb, will fly to San Francisco for a major earth sciences conference, her last for a while.
“I feel real torn about that,” said Indiana University’s Shahzeen Attari, who studies human behavior and climate change. She calls Cobb an important climate communicator. “I don’t want to clip her wings.”
But Cobb and Hayhoe are judged by their audiences on how much energy they use themselves, Attari said.
Attari’s research shows that audiences are turned off by scientists who use lots of energy at home. Listeners are more likely to respond to experts who use less electricity.
“It’s like having an overweight doctor giving you dieting advice,” Attari said. She found that scientists who fly to give talks bother people less.
In science, flying is “deeply embedded in how we do academic work,” said Steven Allen, a management researcher at the University of Sheffield, who recently organized a symposium aimed at         reducing flying in academia. He said the conference went well, with 60 people participating remotely from 12 countries.
Pennsylvania State University’s         Michael Mann, who flies but less than he used to, said moderation is key.
“I don’t tell people they need to become childless, off-the-grid hermits. And I’m not one myself,” Mann said in an email. “I do tell people that individual action is PART of the solution, and that there are many things we can do in our everyday lives that save us money, make us healthier, make us feel better about ourselves AND decrease our environmental footprint. Why wouldn’t we do those things?”
Mann said he gets his electricity from renewables, drives a hybrid vehicle, doesn’t eat meat and has one child.
When Hayhoe flies, she makes sure to bundle in several lectures and visits into one flight, including 30 talks in Alaska in one five-day trip. She said more people come out to see a lecture than if it were given remotely, and she also learns from talking to the people at lectures.
“They need a catalyst to get to the next step and me coming could be that catalyst,” Hayhoe said.
Marshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia will receive a climate communications award at the American Geophysical Union conference Wednesday in San Francisco. But he won’t pick it up in person, saving 1.2 tons of carbon by not flying. He said he doesn’t judge those who fly but wrote about his decision to stay grounded in hopes that people “think about choices and all of the nuances involved in these decisions.”
Former Vice President Al Gore, who has long been criticized by those who reject climate science for his personal energy use, said he has installed 1,000 solar panels at his farm, eats a vegan diet and drives an electric vehicle.
“As important as it to change lightbulbs,” he said in an email, “it is far more important to change the policies and laws in the nation and places where we live.”
Teen activist Greta Thunberg drew attention when she took a zero-carbon sailboat across the Atlantic instead of flying.
“I’m not telling anyone else what to do or what not to do,” Thunberg told The Associated Press before her return boat trip. “I want to put focus on the fact that you basically can’t live sustainable today. It’s practically impossible.”
Cobb is trying. In 2017, she started biking to work instead of driving. She’s installed solar panels, dries clothes on a line, composts and gave up meat. All these made her feel better, physically and mentally, and gave her more hope that people can do enough to curb the worst of climate change.
But when she did the math, she found “all of this stuff is very small compared to flying.”
Cobb began turning down flights and offering to talk remotely. This year she passed on 11 flights, including Paris, Beijing and Sydney.
“There hasn’t been a single step I have taken that has not brought me a deeper appreciation for what we’re up against and what’s possible,” Cobb said. “This gave me a profound appreciation for how individual action connects to collective action.”
But there’s a cost.
Cobb was invited to be the plenary speaker wrapping up a major ocean sciences conference next year in San Diego. It’s a plum role. Cobb asked organizers if she could do it remotely. They said no. She promised to do many roles for the conference from Atlanta. Conference organizers withdrew the offer.
Brooks Hanson, executive vice president of the American Geophysical Union, which runs the conference, said in an email that the group supports remote presentations whenever possible. But the wrap-up speaker position “requires in-person interactions with attendees to get the vibe of the meeting and discussions,” Hanson said.
Foley said that shows the problem: “Climate scientists and activists should walk the walk. But we can only walk so far. Then you bump into other things.”

Holidays bring phishing scam surge aimed at small business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-small-business-67492164,"
The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

Firearm background checks surpass 200K on holiday,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fbi-ran-200k-background-checks-gun-sales-black/story?id=67458289,"
A total of 202,465 firearm background checks were run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system on Black Friday, making it the second-highest single-day for these checks, according to data from the FBI.

The number of background checks this year increased 11% versus 2018 but 2017's Black Friday had a slightly higher total of 203,086.
The FBI emphasized that the data does not represent the number of firearms sold but rather the number of firearm background checks initiated, and a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.
Jurgen Brauer, the chief economist at Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, an industry analytics firm, said it is nearly impossible to calculate actual single-day gun sales with the data available.

""The background checks are not equivalent to unit sales,"" he told ABC News Tuesday. ""Nobody knows what amount of firearms are actually purchased.""

""If you have one handgun background check then you can purchase more than one handgun,"" Brauer said. ""You possibly could have bought three or five.""
In addition, some state laws require licensed gun owners to be re-checked, which can also skew the data.

""States like Kentucky, for instance, run about 300,000 background checks every month for firearms license holder or permit holders,"" he said, adding that they are often called ""re-checks.""

""That doesn't mean that 300,000 Kentuckians rebuy a firearm,"" he noted.

Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting estimates that November 2019 firearm sales ""may come in at about 1.5 million units, and December 2019 sales as high as 1.7 to 1.8 million,"" according to its own algorithm for calculating sales. The firm predicts the 2019 total gun sales will be higher than 2018, but lower than 2016 and 2017.

Consulting firm allows Buttigieg to release names of clients,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/consulting-firm-buttigieg-release-names-clients-67609388,"
The McKinsey & Co. consulting firm said Monday that it will allow Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg to release the identities of the clients he served when he worked for them a decade ago. It came the same day that he announced he would open his fundraising events to the news media and provide the names of key fundraising organizers.
Together the developments represent an effort to respond to critics who have pummeled Buttigieg for not being forthright about how he raises money and the type of corporate work he conducted more than a decade ago when he was fresh out of college. Buttigieg, now the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is coming under growing scrutiny as his campaign moves into the top tier, especially in Iowa, where voters will usher in the Democratic contest in less than two months.
Buttigieg's campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said, “From the start, Pete has said it is important for every candidate to be open and honest, and his actions have reflected that commitment.""
First asking in June, Buttigieg last week requested anew for his former employer to release him from the nondisclosure agreement he signed after working there for three years after graduating from Harvard and Oxford.
Last week, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who trails Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire in presidential primary polls, called on him to disclose his fundraising bundlers, the influential contributors who organize groups of other donors, and to open his fundraisers to the public.
Warren also said Buttigieg's work at McKinsey could reveal conflicts of interest. 
On Friday, Buttigieg released a summary of the work he did at the consulting firm, the most detailed look he had given so far of his time at the company.
McKinsey's statement on Monday said Buttigieg “may disclose the identity of the clients he served while at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010,” with the proviso he not “disclose confidential, proprietary of classified information obtained during the course of that work, or violate any security clearance.” 
Buttigieg did travel to Iraq and Afghanistan and for McKinsey during his time with the firm. 
Buttigieg said Friday that his time at McKinsey involved working in small groups on monthslong assignments, completing studies for clients. 
“The bulk of my work on these teams consisted of doing mathematical analysis, conducting research, and preparing presentations,"" Buttigieg wrote. “I never worked on a project inconsistent with my values, and if asked to do so, I would have left the firm rather than participate.
The Buttigieg campaign released the names of about two dozen fundraising bundlers for the first quarter in April but hasn’t since then. Buttigieg said Friday in Iowa that he would consider releasing more and opening his fundraisers to the media. 
Urged by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot during a presidential forum in Iowa on Friday to break the nondisclosure agreement as President Donald Trump seeks to conceal his keep his financial information, Buttigieg said, “I am asking my former employer to do the right thing, to not make me choose between claiming the moral high ground and going back on my word.""

Defamation trial begins over Elon Musk's 'pedo guy' tweet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/elon-musks-pedo-guy-tweet-defamation-trial-begins/story?id=67458299,"
The trial over a since-deleted tweet from entrepreneur Elon Musk calling a British diver a ""pedo guy"" began in a California courtroom Tuesday.

Musk took the stand Tuesday afternoon, calling Twitter a ""free-for-all"" and saying, ""There's everything on Twitter.""

The legal saga over the social media post began in September 2018 when the Tesla CEO was sued by diver Vernon Unsworth for defamation.

The suit was the culmination of a public spat between Musk and Unsworth that began earlier that summer when seemingly the whole world tuned in to the rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach who were trapped in a cave in northern Thailand for 18 days in June and July.
Unsworth was a diver on the ground in Thailand attempting to aid the Thai Navy and first responders with his diving expertise. Musk, meanwhile, built a submarine with a team of engineers and sent it to the Thai Navy to aid in the rescue efforts.

The diver called the submarine a ""PR stunt"" in an interview with CNN, saying that Musk ""can stick his submarine where it hurts.""

Musk then lashed out at Unsworth and wrote in the tweet at the center of the lawsuit: ""We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.""

He admitted in court Tuesday he had never heard of Unsworth until seeing him in the CNN interview and did not know about his involvement in the cave rescue beforehand. Musk called Unsworth's claims an unprovoked attack on a good-natured act.
In the original complaint filed in 2018, attorneys for Unsworth argue that the word ""pedo"" ""is a well-recognized shorthand phrase for the term pedophile.""

""As one of the highest-profile and wealthiest individuals in the world, Musk knew that this accusations against Mr. Unsworth would be conveyed to a worldwide audience and would result in the accusations receiving massive publicity,"" the court documents state.

Under questioning in court, Musk said Tuesday that some people found him influential -- and others do not.

Moreover, lawyers for Unsworth argue that Musk doubled down on the accusation -- emailing a BuzzFeed News reporter and claiming Unsworth has a ""child bride,"" among other allegations, according to Unsworth’s lawyers.

Musk concluded the note to the reporter with: ""I f------ hope he sues me,"" according to the complaint.
Musk defended his tirade in a court declaration filed in September 2019, saying he had watched the CNN interview Unsworth gave and that his tweets were ""responding to Mr. Unsworth’s false claims and attack on the effort and character of my team and me.""

""By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia,"" the court filing said. ""'Pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person’s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of acts of pedophilia.""
Musk added that his email to the BuzzFeed News reporter was labeled ""off the record,"" and he did not expect them to publish its contents without verifying it themselves.

Unsworth is seeking more than $75,000 in damages, attorney fees, and a court order stopping Musk from making further allegations.

Attorneys for Unsworth and Musk did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on Tuesday.

Ultimately, the 12 boys and their coach stuck in the cave were rescued by a team of international divers. Musk's submarine was not used.

French union warns pension reform strike could hit Christmas,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/france-8th-day-pension-strikes-cripple-train-travel-67680588,"PARIS -- 
Paris commuters crammed into the city's sole two fully working Metro lines Thursday as labor strikes over pension reforms crippled France's train services for an eighth day and a major union warned the work stoppages could continue without pause until Christmas.
Tensions flared in several parts of the country. Police fired tear gas Thursday morning at protesters in the western city of Nantes, and protesters set vehicles on fire in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille.
Unions have flatly rejected fresh proposals by the government of President Emmanuel Macron to stagger the roll-out of the controversial plan that would require France's youngest workers to stay on the job two years longer, until the age of 64, to be eligible for a full pension.
“No Christmas break unless the government comes to its senses,” Laurent Brun of the General Work Confederation union warned Thursday. 
Workers across many sectors are participating in the nationwide general strike, including teachers, doctors, nurses, railway personnel, actors and garbage collectors. 
The National Syndicate of High School Teachers said it was “stepping up” its actions against reforms it branded “unacceptable” with fresh protests across major French cities Thursday. 
The unions' quick dismissal of the proposal the government made Wednesday signals that labor leaders were serious when they billed the strikes as “unlimited.” 
The strikes threaten to mirror similar ones in 1995 that lasted over three weeks, ended in the ouster of Prime Minister Alain Juppe and with proposed pension reforms being scrapped. The 1995 strikes were themselves compared in scale to the seismic events of May 1968, when France reached the brink of revolution.
Though Parisians have been adversely affected since they rely the most on public transportation, other parts of France have experienced less aggravation and the striking workers have enjoyed widespread public support, according to polls. 
The mood among the public remains strained but understanding. 
“I totally understand why people are on strike... Obviously, everyone is affected by the pension reform,"" London-Paris commuter Nicolas Lipitei said Thursday.
“(But) I think there should be better provisions to accommodate getting to work. There’s a huge impact on the economy, a huge impact to people,” he added.
Many French people and the unions leading the strikes fear the new system will force people to work longer for smaller pensions. 
The government said the changes would ensure the pension system is “fair and sustainable"" in the face of a growing population with a record number of people over age 90.

Saudi stock offering creates world's most valuable company,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/saudi-stock-offering-creates-worlds-valuable-company-67665708,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- 
Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company Wednesday when its shares made their debut on the Saudi stock exchange, part of an ambitious shift away from the very fossil fuels the country's economy depends on. 
The shares' 10% rally brought state-owned Aramco's value to $1.88 trillion. The 1.5% of the company that is listed has raised $25.6 billion, a record for an initial public offering. As of Tuesday's close in the U.S., Apple was valued at $1.19 trillion. 
Despite the success of the sale, the kingdom's decision not to list the company on a larger foreign exchange points to concerns that a global flotation would raise. Listing shares outside Saudi Arabia would open up the company to greater disclosure rules and expose it to foreign laws at a time when the country is under scrutiny for its role in regional conflicts as well as for the killing of a dissident journalist.
“A local Saudi offering is, by all accounts, a friendly audience of Saudi investors,” said Gianna Bern, the author of ""Investing in Energy"" and lecturer at the University of Notre Dame. She said the real test for Aramco will be a global offering, in another jurisdiction, such as London or Asia. Aramco, however, has said it will not sell more shares for at least another year.
Wednesday's shares were sold mainly to investors in the region: a 0.5% stake to individual retail investors in Gulf Arab states and 1% to institutional investors.
Non-Saudi investors contributed just 23% of the institutional investment generated in the IPO, according to lead adviser Samba Capital. Saudi companies and government institutions raised 51% of the overall demand, Samba Capital said. 
Some analysts said that the surge on the first day of trading suggests heavy buying from investors close to the crown prince to make the operation a hit.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman plans to use the money raised from the sale of a sliver of the kingdom's crown jewel to diversify the country's economy and fund major national projects that create jobs for millions of young Saudis entering the workforce. 
The sale raises capital for the Public Investment Fund overseen by Prince Mohammed, but it is only part of a much larger transformation program to move the economy away from reliance on oil exports for revenue.
The share sale also has been an exercise in national prestige, with the 34-year-old crown prince looking for the flotation to value Aramco at $2 trillion.
Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer of Dalma Capital, which manages Saudi equity funds that invested in Aramco, said the company could on day two of trading become the first in the world valued at over $2 trillion if the stock gains another 10%. 
“A lot of international investors have felt that there should be a discount to Aramco shares due to perceived geopolitical risk. We actually believe geopolitical risk in Aramco is overstated and that the recent September 14th attacks actually demonstrated Aramco's resilience.” Cefaratti added.
The shares rose sharply in the first moment of trading Wednesday to hit the 10% limit on stock price fluctuation allowed by Saudi regulators. That pushed the price to 35.2 riyals, or $9.39 a share, where it held until closing at 3 p.m.
The $2 trillion value was considered too high for many international investors, particularly as global oil prices are under pressure from rising production in other countries, especially the United States, and amid a global push toward renewable energy. 
Foreign investors have also been spooked by the geopolitical risks associated with Aramco. A stunning missile attack in September struck Aramco's main crude oil processing facility. The Saudis and the U.S. blamed regional rival Iran, which denies involvement.
The kingdom's reputation has, meanwhile, been stained by the killing of Saudi critic and writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Turkey last year. Controversy over that killing and Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen have hampered efforts to attract more Western investment to Saudi Arabia.
Still, Aramco remains an attractive investment locally. It was the most profitable company in the world last year, earning $111 billion in net income
Aramco, which has exclusive rights to produce and sell the kingdom's energy reserves, was founded in 1933 with America’s Standard Oil Co. before becoming fully owned by Saudi Arabia four decades ago.
To encourage Saudi citizens to buy and keep hold of Aramco stock, the company says it will pay a dividend to shareholders of at least $75 billion. Saudi citizens who hold their shares for six months from the first day of trading can also receive up to 100 bonus shares, or one for every 10 held. The government also made it easier to access credit for Saudis to buy stock. 
The result was that just over 5 million individuals, nearly all of them Saudi nationals out of a population of around 20 million citizens, generated subscriptions of $13 billion.
With oil prices hovering around $63 a barrel, the kingdom needs a break-even oil price of $87 a barrel to balance its budget and climb out of deficit, according to Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. 
One of the biggest expenditures is government salaries for the millions of Saudis who work in the public sector. Aramco's flotation helps generate billions of dollars to invest in projects that benefit private businesses and keep unemployment from rising beyond current levels of roughly 12%. 
In the lead-up to the flotation, there had been a strong push for Saudis, including princes and businessmen, to contribute to what's seen locally as a moment of national pride, and even duty. 
A brief ceremony as trading started on Wednesday saw a countdown in Arabic, the sounding of a bell, a light show with music and applause all around. At the celebration at the Fairmont hotel in Riyadh, Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan, described the sale as “a proud and historic moment for Saudi Aramco and our majority shareholder, the kingdom.”"
Gun background checks are on pace to break record in 2019,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gun-background-checks-pace-break-record-2019-67470129,"
Background checks on gun purchases in the U.S. are climbing toward a record high this year, reflecting what the industry says is a rush by people to buy weapons in reaction to the Democratic presidential candidates' calls for tighter restrictions.
By the end of November, more than 25.4 million background checks — generally seen as a strong indicator of gun sales — had been conducted by the FBI, putting 2019 on pace to break the record of 27.5 million set in 2016, the last full year President Barack Obama was in the White House.
On Black Friday alone, the FBI ran 202,465 checks — one every 4.85 seconds.
Some analysts question how accurately the background check figures translate into gun sales, since some states run checks on applications for concealed-carry permits, too, and some purchases involve multiple firearms. But the numbers remain the most reliable method of tracking the industry.
In the years since President Donald Trump took office, the industry has struggled through what has been referred to as the Trump Slump, a falloff in sales that reflected little worry among gun owners about gun control efforts.
But with the 2020 presidential election less than a year out and virtually every Democratic candidate offering proposals to restrict access to firearms, fears appear to be driving up sales again.
“The Trump Slump is real, but the politics of guns has changed a little bit over the last year,” said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law and an expert on gun rights and politics. “As we’re coming up upon another presidential election, Donald Trump is vulnerable, and the Democratic presidential contenders are falling all over themselves to propose more aggressive gun reforms than their opponents.”
Trump has been viewed as one of the most gun-friendly presidents in modern history and has boasted of strong support from the National Rifle Association. He has addressed every one of its annual conventions since the 2016 campaign, and the powerful gun lobby pumped about $30 million into efforts to elect him.
Still, hopes of expanded gun rights under Trump’s watch haven’t materialized. Legislation that would make it easier to buy silencers stalled in Congress. In addition, Trump pushed through a ban on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to mimic machine-gun fire. The gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history used such a device.
The industry has been going through one of its toughest periods, with some gunmakers, such as Remington Arms, filing for bankruptcy. More recently, Smith & Wesson’s parent company, American Outdoor Brands, announced plans to spin off its firearms unit, and Colt said it would suspend production of AR-15 rifles.
Amid some high-profile mass shootings in recent years, especially the Parkland school attack in Florida that left 17 people dead, gun control advocates have gained some momentum.
The crowded field of Democrats running for the White House has offered a variety of proposals to curtail gun rights. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, whose state has seen repeated mass shootings this past year, went so far as to push for a mandatory buyback program for AR- and AK-style rifles before dropping out of the race, stoking gun owners’ fears when he declared during a debate, ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.""
The gun industry says the figures from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System reflect the Second Amendment politics of the White House race.
“Americans are choosing to invest their hard-earned dollars in their ability to exercise their rights and buy the firearms they want before gun control politicians attempt to regulate away that ability,” said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry.
Still, some experts took issue with the figures and said it is premature to declare the Trump Slump is over.
“These numbers cannot be taken be taken at face value,” said Jurgen Brauer, a retired business professor and now chief economist at Small Arms Analytics, which consults on the firearms industry.
Brauer said the numbers are increasingly skewed by states such as Kentucky that also run background checks when they issue or renew a permit to carry a concealed firearm. In October, for example, the state ran more than 280,000 checks through the NICS system for permits.
“That number has been rising over time as increasingly states check with some frequency on their existing permits,” Brauer said.
The NICS system was created after passage of the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks to buy a firearm. Convicted felons, domestic abusers and people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution are among those who cannot legally purchase a weapon.
In 1999, the first full year the system was used, just over 9 million background checks were conducted. It was near the end of Democrat Bill Clinton’s second term and in the midst of a 10-year ban on assault rifles that expired in 2004.
Background checks declined under President George W. Bush but picked up again in 2006 and have mostly risen since then, except for 2014 and 2017. In 2018, there were 26.18 million background checks.
“Gunmakers are promoting the idea that you should buy these guns now because they may be banned in the future,” Winkler said."
"Airbnb introduces new rules to rein in parties, nuisances",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/airbnb-introduces-rules-rein-parties-nuisances-67518534,"
Airbnb is taking more steps to crack down on parties and nuisance guests in the wake of a Halloween shooting at an Airbnb rental in a San Francisco suburb where five people were killed.
The company said Thursday it’s banning “open invite” parties at all of its accommodations. Those are parties open to anyone and advertised on social media, for example.
Airbnb says boutique hotels and professional event venues will be exempt from the new rule.
The San Francisco-based company is also banning large parties at apartment buildings and condos.
“This policy does not impact parties that are authorized by hosts and convened respectfully by guests,” the company said in a news release. “Instead, our goal with this new policy is to address the small number of guests who act irresponsibly and those rare hosts whose homes become persistent neighborhood nuisances.”
Airbnb says it’s in the process of identifying listings globally that may be violating the party house ban, including accommodations in Los Angeles, Miami Beach, London and Montreal. The company says it’s asking hosts to update their listings to comply with the ‘’open invite” ban.
Airbnb is also issuing new guest behavior rules. In early 2020, guests will get a warning for one instance of excessive noise, unauthorized guests, unauthorized parking, unauthorized smoking or excessive messiness reported by a host or a neighbor. Further violations will result in account suspension or removal.
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky announced last month that changes would be coming after         five people were killed at a Halloween party shooting in Orinda. The owner of the Airbnb rental didn't authorize the party, which had more than 100 guests.
AirbnbWatch, a hotel-funded group that calls for stricter local home-sharing regulations, faulted Airbnb for responding only after the Orinda shooting. AirbnbWatch said there have been dozens of shootings at Airbnb rentals over the last six months, and the company isn't doing enough to ensure guest and neighbor safety.
But Daniel Guttentag, an assistant professor in the department of hospitality and tourism management at the College of Charleston School of Business, said he thinks the new policies demonstrate Airbnb's genuine intention to rid the platform of some of its most problematic activity. He thinks the rules could also help shield Airbnb from liability if a party goes awry.
“The challenge for Airbnb will be enforcing these rules, though, as its immense scale can make that difficult,” Guttentag said. Airbnb has more than 7 million listings worldwide.
Guttentag said it could also be hard for Airbnb to determine what is “too loud” and ensure that neighbors reporting a problem aren't just trying to shut a rental down.
The company is under pressure to gain the trust of travelers, neighbors and lawmakers as it prepares for its planned initial public offering next year.
Airbnb also said Thursday it’s establishing a dedicated hotline for mayors and city officials who have questions about its policies."
Uber weighs next steps after sex assault report,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uber-weighs-steps-jarring-sex-assault-report-67571257,"
A day after Uber revealed that more than 3,000 riders and drivers were sexually assaulted last year while using its service, attention is turning to what's next for the ride-hailing giant and whether its plans to improve safety go far enough.
Uber's report was hailed by victims' rights organizations for taking a step that other companies have so far been unwilling to match. But it's unclear whether the transparency will help rebuild trust or backfire by showing customers how deep Uber's safety problems go.
In the safety report, Uber said 464 people were raped while using its services in 2017 and 2018. Almost all of them — 92% — were riders. It's difficult to compare those statistics to other modes of transportation, because U.S. taxi companies and transit agencies generally do not collect similar national data.
Even so, many said the report shows Uber has work to do.
“This is a major crisis situation that they're going to have to deal with because the brand's built on safety, and even though some could try to say it's a small number, it's still way too high — it's higher than zero — and I think that shows a gap in their screening process,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. The revelations give “meat on the bones” to regulators, including those in London who chose not to renew Uber's license over safety issues, he said.
Uber has been working to improve safety over the last two years, rolling out features including an in-app emergency button, a ride-check feature that detects unexpected stops or crashes and the ability for riders or drivers to share their location with loved ones during a ride. The company outlined additional safety steps it will take in the report.
On Monday, Uber plans to launch in seven cities a feature to give riders a four-digit number that they can use to verify that they are getting into the right car. Next year, it plans to launch a survivor support hotline staffed by RAINN, a sexual violence organization, and to provide sexual misconduct education for drivers. The hotline may encourage more victims to report attacks.
The report only covers Uber's U.S. operations. The U.S. and Canada brought in 63% of Uber's revenue last quarter. Lyft said it would release its own safety report, but it has not indicated when.
Critics say Uber should be doing more, particularly with background checks, to weed out potentially dangerous drivers. Unlike many taxi companies, Uber and its main U.S. rival, Lyft, do not check drivers' fingerprints against a national database.
The gold standard for background checks is fingerprinting “because someone can easily fake a Social Security number,"" said Dominique Penson, an attorney who has represented sexual assault victims. “You can't fake a fingerprint. And if somebody has been convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States, that will appear in a national database, and when you run that fingerprint, you'll know.""
Uber says the FBI has acknowledged its database is incomplete and does not always include a final disposition. The company's process includes a motor vehicle screening, a criminal background check and ongoing notifications about any new offenses.
An added fingerprint check could add precious time to the driver-approval process at a time when both Uber and Lyft are fiercely competing for market share. 
Dashboard cameras also could help by recording incidents and serving as a deterrent for bad behavior, said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. Campbell encourages drivers to get cameras, but the ride-hailing companies have not encouraged the practice.
“Even if you have dashcam footage, it's hard to get Uber and Lyft to actually look at the footage,"" Campbell said.
Last month, Uber announced it would allow passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico to record audio of their rides.
A U.S. House committee is looking at legislation that could reduce the number of sex assaults involving ride-hailing passengers and drivers, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said Friday.
The committee has discussed requiring fingerprint background checks, camera monitoring and front license plates for ride-hailing cars in states that don’t have them. This would help prevent fake ride-hailing drivers from picking up passengers by making it easier for passengers to check plate numbers against the ones provided by Uber and Lyft, DeFazio said.
In Eugene, Oregon, fingerprint checks earlier this year by the local police department found about two dozen Uber and Lyft drivers had criminal records that were missed in the companies’ checks, DeFazio said. One was a convicted murderer, while another was a registered sex offender, according to The Register-Guard newspaper. The city stopped the people from driving for the companies.
There may be limits on what federal legislators can do. Ride-hailing companies could be regulated federally because they conduct interstate commerce, but that is new legal territory, he said.
Still, he applauded Uber’s report, saying the company had done more than any of its competitors “by just reporting,"" DeFazio said. “There’s more to be done, for sure.”
The report raised alarm among some riders.
“I think I've taken it a little bit for granted, the fact that the app already tracks who I am and where I'm at,"" said Mary Yao, 28, an MBA student at U.C. Berkeley. “I think I'll be more conscientious next time I climb into a car to not always be on my phone. So it has made me raise my awareness a little bit.”
Bryant Greening, an attorney and co-founder of LegalRideshare, a Chicago law firm that specializes in ride-sharing cases, noted that more than 40% percent of the reported sexual assaults, which include incidents less serious than rape, were against drivers, who also are at risk.
“There’s no more dangerous place to be than in a moving car with a stranger,” Greening said. “You are really vulnerable without a clear path to escape. So this system, rideshare, needs to be made safe for everybody who is in that car.”

Black Friday firearm background checks surpass 200K: FBI,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fbi-ran-200k-background-checks-gun-sales-black/story?id=67458289,"
A total of 202,465 firearm background checks were run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system on Black Friday, making it the second-highest single-day for these checks, according to data from the FBI.

The number of background checks this year increased 11% versus 2018 but 2017's Black Friday had a slightly higher total of 203,086.
The FBI emphasized that the data does not represent the number of firearms sold but rather the number of firearm background checks initiated, and a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.
Jurgen Brauer, the chief economist at Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, an industry analytics firm, said it is nearly impossible to calculate actual single-day gun sales with the data available.

""The background checks are not equivalent to unit sales,"" he told ABC News Tuesday. ""Nobody knows what amount of firearms are actually purchased.""

""If you have one handgun background check then you can purchase more than one handgun,"" Brauer said. ""You possibly could have bought three or five.""
In addition, some state laws require licensed gun owners to be re-checked, which can also skew the data.

""States like Kentucky, for instance, run about 300,000 background checks every month for firearms license holder or permit holders,"" he said, adding that they are often called ""re-checks.""

""That doesn't mean that 300,000 Kentuckians rebuy a firearm,"" he noted.

Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting estimates that November 2019 firearm sales ""may come in at about 1.5 million units, and December 2019 sales as high as 1.7 to 1.8 million,"" according to its own algorithm for calculating sales. The firm predicts the 2019 total gun sales will be higher than 2018, but lower than 2016 and 2017.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepping down at Google,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/google-founders-larry-page-sergey-brin-stepping-company/story?id=67472607,"
Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin -- who built the tech giant 20 years ago with servers in a garage -- announced on Tuesday that they are stepping down as CEO and president, respectively, from the company.

Sundar Pichai will be the new CEO of Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., effective immediately, according to a statement from the company.
Page and Brin co-founded the company in 1998 and led it to becoming the international tech industry leader it is today. The two will remain active at Alphabet Inc. as co-founders, shareholders and board members, the company said.
In a joint open letter announcing their decision to leave, Page and Brin equated Google to their child, who would now be 21.

""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" the letter stated. ""While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!""
The letter added that they believe ""Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" and Pichai will take on the role of CEO for both Alphabet and Google, saying they ""plan to continue talking with Sundar regularly, especially on topics we’re passionate about!""
The founders added that they could have never imagined what Google would become when they started it in a dorm room and then a garage.

""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets,"" the letter said.

It continued: ""We could not have imagined, back in 1998 when we moved our servers from a dorm room to a garage, the journey that would follow.""
Pichai said in statement that he is ""looking forward to continuing to work with Larry and Sergey.""

""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration,"" Pichai added. ""It’s a strong foundation on which we will continue to build.”

"Protests subside, but economic aftershocks rattle Haitians",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/protests-subside-economic-aftershocks-rattle-haitians-67575900,"
The flaming barricades are mostly gone, protesters have largely dissipated and traffic is once again clogging the streets of Haiti’s capital, but hundreds of thousands of people are now suffering deep economic aftershocks after more than two months of demonstrations. 
The protests that drew tens of thousands of people at a time to demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse also squeezed incomes, shuttered businesses and disrupted the transportation of basic goods. 
“We are nearing a total crash,” Haitian economist Camille Chalmers said. “The situation is unsustainable.” 
Haiti’s economy was already fragile when the new round of protests began in mid-September, organized by opposition leaders and supporters angry over corruption, spiraling inflation and dwindling supplies, including fuel. More than 40 people were killed and dozens injured as protesters clashed with police. Moïse insisted he would not resign and called for dialogue. 
The United Nations World Food Program says a recent survey found that one in three Haitians, or 3.7 million people, need urgent food assistance and 1 million are experiencing severe hunger. The WFP, which says it is trying to get emergency food assistance to 700,000 people, blames rising prices, the weakening local currency, and a drop in agricultural production due partly to the disruption of recent protests.
In the last two years, Haiti’s currency, the gourde, declined 60% against the dollar and inflation recently reached 20%, Chalmers said. The rising cost of food is especially crucial in the country of nearly 11 million people. Some 60% make less than $2 a day and 25% earn less than $1 a day. 
A 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of rice has more than doubled in price in the local currency, said Marcelin Saingiles, a store owner who sells everything from cold drinks to cookies to used tools in Port-au-Prince. 
The 39-year-old father of three children said he now struggles to buy milk and vegetables. 
“I feed the kids, but they’re not eating the way they’re supposed to,” he said, adding that he has drained the funds set aside for his children’s schooling to buy food. 
A growing number of families across Haiti can’t even afford to do that since the protests began, with barricades preventing the flow of goods between the capital and the rest of the country. 
Many of those live in Haiti’s rural areas, which also have been hardest hit by demonstrations that continue in some cities and towns. 
Wadlande Pierre, 23, said she temporarily moved in with her aunt in the southwest town of Les Cayes to escape the violent protests in Port-au-Prince. However, she had to move back to the capital because there was not gas, power or water in Les Cayes, and food was becoming scarce. 
“There is no access to basic items that you need,” she said. 
Pierre is now helping her mother, Vanlancia Julien, sell fruits and vegetables on a sidewalk in the neighborhood of Delmas in the capital. 
Julien said she recently lost a couple hundred dollars’ worth of produce because she could not go out on the street to sell due to the protests. 
“All the melon, avocado, mango, pineapple, bananas, all of them spoiled,” she said. 
Last year, sales were good, but she is now making a third of what she used to earn before the protests began, even though streets have reopened. 
“That doesn’t amount to anything,” she said. “The fact that people don’t go out to work, it’s less people moving around and makes it harder for me.” 
That also means businesses like the small restaurant that 43-year-old Widler Saint-Jean Santil owns often remain empty when they used to be full on a regular afternoon. 
He said the protests have forced many business owners to lay off people, which in turn affects him because clients can no longer afford to eat out. 
“If people are not working, there is no business,” he said. 
Among the businesses that permanently closed was the Best Western Premier hotel, which laid off dozens of employees. 
Chalmers warned that economic recovery will be slow if the political instability continues, adding that the situation is the worst Haiti has faced in recent history. 
“A lot of crises came together,” he said. “Not only the economic one, but the political and fiscal ones.”

Saudi Aramco plans $25.6B share sale in biggest ever IPO,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/saudi-aramco-plans-256b-share-sale-biggest-ipo-67526241,"
Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company Aramco on Thursday set a share price for its IPO — expected to be the biggest ever — that puts the value of the company at $1.7 trillion, more than Apple or Microsoft.
The company said it will sell its shares at 32 riyals ($8.53) each, putting the overall value of the stake being sold at $25.6 billion.
Aramco, which pumps and produces Saudi Arabia’s crude oil to the world, is floating a 1.5% stake in the company, or 3 billion shares. Trading is expected to happen on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange on Dec. 11, or by mid-December.
The company is selling 0.5% to individual investors, who are Saudi citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia, and 1% to institutional investors, which can be sovereign wealth funds, asset managers and government-run pension programs.
The pricing of the shares is at the top range of what Aramco had sought. The company had priced it shares ranging from 30 to 32 riyals each, or between 8$ and $8.53 a share.
In the announcement Thursday, Aramco said the offering drew heavy demand. 
The company's financial advisers had said earlier that most orders had come from Saudi funds or companies, with foreign investors— including from neighboring Gulf Arab states— accounting for 10.5% of the bids. It was not immediately known what the final figures released Thursday represent and how much of that was generated by foreign investment. 
The highly anticipated sale of a sliver of the company has generated global buzz since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first announced plans for it more than two years ago. That’s in part because it would clock in as the world’s biggest IPO, surpassing record holder Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese conglomerate and e-commerce company, which raised about $25 billion in 2014.
The kingdom’s plan to sell part of the company is part of a wider economic overhaul aimed at raising new streams of revenue for the oil-dependent country. This as oil prices struggle to reach the $75 to $80 per barrel price range that analysts say is needed to balance Saudi Arabia’s budget. Brent crude is trading at just over $63 a barrel.
Prince Mohammed has said listing Aramco is one way for the kingdom to raise capital for the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which would then use that money to develop new cities and lucrative projects across Saudi Arabia.
Despite the mammoth figures involved in the IPO, they are not quite what the crown prince had envisioned based on the prince's own remarks over the past two years. He’d previously talked about a valuation for Aramco of $2 trillion and a flotation of 5% of the company involving a listing on a foreign stock exchange. There are no immediate plans for an international listing.
Aramco said Thursday it would retain the option of an even bigger offering of a 3.45 billion share sale, representing $29.4 billion.
Despite Aramco’s profitability, the state’s control of the company carries a number of risks for investors. Two key Aramco processing sites were targeted by drones and missiles in September, an attack that was claimed by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen but which the U.S. blamed on Iran. Iran denies the allegation.
The Saudi government also stipulates oil production levels, which directly impacts Aramco’s output.
On Thursday, the countries that make up the OPEC oil-producing cartel — led by heavyweight Saudi Arabia— were meeting in Vienna to decide whether to cut down on their production and push up prices of fuel and energy around the world."
Cannabis stocks' 2019 skid showing few signs of easing,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/cannabis-stocks-2019-skid-showing-signs-easing-67545794,"
When it comes to investing in cannabis stocks, the marijuana bud's faded bloom has shown few signs of returning this year. 
Cannabis stocks have had a harsh comedown as investors' enthusiasm about the prospects for strong growth and blockbuster company mergers has dimmed.
The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange traded fund, which focuses on cannabis stocks, is down 32.5% this year and off 40.1% from a year ago. Shares in some of the biggest marijuana companies, including Tilary, MedMen Enterprises and Aurora Cannabis, have fallen much further. 
At the same time, the broader stock market is on track for strong gains. The S&P 500 index is up 25.5% this year and 16.7% above where it stood 12 months ago.
Several factors have combined this year to weigh down cannabis stocks.
In Canada, which legalized marijuana in October of 2018, sales have been stymied by government limits on the type of products with cannabis that retailers can sell. In addition, some provinces have been slower than others to allow the opening of marijuana stores. And the cheaper black market for marijuana also has siphoned sales from the licensed retailers.
""The big issue there has been an issue of oversupply,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Bobby Burleson. ""This last earnings season you saw companies struggling from excess supply and shortfalls in demand.""
Canada lifted its limitations on the types of cannabis products that companies can sell in October. Companies are expected to begin selling marijuana-infused food, beverages and other products that had been previously prohibited as early as this month. If there's a meaningful increase in sales, that could help push stocks higher.
Demand hasn't been an issue for companies that sell marijuana products in U.S. states where cannabis is legal in some form. What's been weighing on stocks is a stalled wave of big company mergers that many investors were banking on to drive shares higher. 
The Department of Justice is still reviewing several proposed deals that were announced late last year and early this year for possible antitrust concerns. 
Two companies involved in one of those mergers said last month that they had entered a 30-day waiting period after complying with a request for more information on the deal from the Department of Justice. That raised the possibility that regulators could be close to wrapping up their review of the all-stock deal, which was valued at the time of the announcement in April at $850 million.
The uncertain fate of that and other proposed mergers has put a chill on more deals this year.
In October, Los Angeles-based MedMen Enterprises backed out of its attempt to buy PharmaCann, a Chicago-based marijuana company. At the time, MedMen noted that the pullback in U.S. and Canadian cannabis stocks, which makes it tougher for public companies to raise money from stock sales, made it increasingly critical to allocate capital efficiently.
""A lack of access to capital has been a main issue this year in the U.S.,"" Burleson said. ""When we get some sizable deals closing, that will be a positive catalyst for the U.S. players.""
Government regulations remain hurdles for companies in the business of growing, distributing or selling cannabis.
A U.S. House committee approved a proposal to decriminalize and tax marijuana at the federal level last month. The news only gave pot stocks a momentary bump. It's unclear whether the measure will be taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate.
Vaping-related deaths and illnesses have also hurt cannabis stocks, though recent data suggest the scare dampened sales mainly in California, where vaping products make up a larger share of overall sales.
Still, industry analysts project the market for marijuana products will continue to grow over the next decade, which should bode well for cannabis stocks.
Burleson expects cannabis retail sales in legal U.S. state markets will climb from an estimated $12.9 billion this year to $31.3 billion in 2024. The forecast bakes in projections for sales in Illinois, which will begin allowing pot sales next month, and Michigan, which began doing so this week. It also assumes that Arizona, Florida and New York will pass adult-use pot laws within the next five years.
Last month, analysts at Cowen raised their sales forecast for the U.S. cannabis market over the next 10 years, citing higher levels of use among older consumers and improved public sentiment for legalization. 
Cowen projects sales to hit $85 billion by 2030. It previously called for sales to reach $80 billion.
The forecast also anticipates the opening of more dispensaries, the rollout of new types of cannabis products and more overall demand.
""We see opportunities in the U.S. across both medical and adult use markets, as current levels of patient and user counts within multiple states suggest ample room for additional doors,"" Cowen analysts wrote. “We continue to see strong investor interest in the cannabis category despite recent stock price performance.”"
Trump’s US-Japan trade deal wins Japan parliament approval,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trumps-us-japan-trade-deal-wins-japan-parliament-67479461,"
Japan’s Parliament on Wednesday approved a trade deal that was agreed upon by President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this year.
The deal cutting tariffs between the countries takes effect at the beginning of next year. It cleared Japan’s upper house Wednesday after clearing the more powerful lower house earlier.
Some critics say the deal is more advantageous to the U.S. since a 2.5% tariff on Japanese automobiles remains.
The deal will pave the way for cheaper American beef and other agricultural products in Japan.
Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration.
U.S. farmers have felt they were at a disadvantage compared to Australian or Canadian counterparts.
Japan also reached a separate trade deal with Europe.
Japan, which imports U.S. farm products worth $14 billion, is America’s third-largest market.
The U.S. and Japan have agreed to continue talks on trade, and the auto tariffs are likely to come up in the talks.
The Japanese auto industry is a key part of this nation’s economy, although the manufacturers, such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., have moved production abroad to avert tariffs and become part of American business.
When the trade deal was reached in September, Trump said it means opening Japan’s market to about $7 billion in U.S. farm goods, with tariffs lowered or scrapped on American beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn and wine.
Abe has called the deal a “win-win,” prompting criticism from the opposition. Japanese farmers form a large support base for Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Japan has long had protectionist policies on agricultural imports, especially rice.

African countries set meetings to resolve Nile dam dispute,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/african-countries-set-meetings-resolve-nile-dam-dispute-67613128,"
Officials from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan say they have agreed to hold two technical meetings in coming weeks in an effort to resolve a number of issues revolving around a $5 billion dam project on the Nile River.
The foreign ministers of the three countries met in Washington Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass in an effort to resolve the dispute.
In a joint statement, the group of officials said progress had been made in earlier          meetings with the ministers of water resources from the three countries.
Two more technical meetings will take place in coming weeks centered on coming up with rules and guidelines for the filling and operation of the dam, the statement said.
“The ministers recognize that there are substantial benefits to all three countries in developing rules and guidelines to address drought conditions,” the joint statement said.
The statement said the implementation of these technical rules will be undertaken by Ethiopia but may be adjusted by all three countries in accordance with water conditions in any given year.
The group of officials will reconvene in Washington on Jan. 13 to review the results of the technical meetings which will be held in Khartoum, Sudan, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the statement said.
The project, called the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, is around 70% complete and promises to provide much needed electricity for Ethiopia's 70 million people. However, Egyptian officials are concerned that filing the reservoir behind the dam could significantly reduce the amount of Nile water available to Egypt. 
The joint statement said that the rules and guidelines developed for the operation of the dam would include ways to mitigate drought conditions based upon the natural flow of the Nile and water release rates from the dam’s reservoir.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly this fall, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he would never allow Ethiopia to impose a “de facto situation” by filling the dam without an agreement on its operation.
“While we acknowledge Ethiopia’s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,” he said."
Huawei exec pens letter while fighting extradition,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/huawei-executive-meng-wanzhou-shes-reading-oil-painting/story?id=67436993,"
The Huawei executive at the center of an international extradition saga has penned an open letter thanking supporters to mark the anniversary of her arrest in Canada -- and to let them know she has spent the time reading and oil painting.

Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and deputy chairwoman of Huawei, is fighting extradition charges to the United States following her arrest in Vancouver last December.

She is free on bail and living in a multimillion-dollar mansion, according to the Associated Press.

Her extradition hearings are set to begin Jan. 20.
In a letter published to Huawei's website, Meng writes that she has spent the past year reading books ""cover to cover"" and has enough time now to ""carefully complete an oil painting.""

""It was never my intention to be stuck here so long, but I suddenly find that a whole year has snuck by, and here I still am,"" she wrote.
""The past year has witnessed moments of fear, pain, disappointment, helplessness, torment, and struggle,"" she added. ""Over the past year, I have also learned to face up to and accept my situation. I'm no longer afraid of the unknown.""

She expressed gratitude for the support of Huawei employees and customers.

""Every time I appear in court, a crowd waits outside,"" she said. ""Your passion and support have always warmed my heart.""
Meng's arrest stems from fraud charges involving Huawei and subsidiaries regarding alleged dealings with Iran, a violation of EU and US sanctions. She faces extradition to the U.S.

The Chinese Embassy in Canada has repeatedly called for the immediate release of Meng.

“This is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise,” the embassy said in a statement on its website in March.

Meng is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, who founded Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world. "
Lufthansa selling European catering business to gategroup,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/lufthansa-selling-european-catering-business-gategroup-67590425,"
Lufthansa is selling the European business of its catering and services subsidiary LSG Group to Switzerland-based gategroup for an undisclosed amount, the German airline said Monday.
The deal covers LSG's European catering operations as well as its lounge and equipment businesses, packaged food provider Evertaste and retail operator Ringeltaube, Lufthansa said. Between them, those businesses have 7,100 employees and had revenue of some 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) last year.
Lufthansa said that the sale won't have any major impact on its profit this year or next.
CEO Carsten Spohr said that “in gategroup we have found a new owner for LSG’s European business which has catering as its core activity.” That, he added, gives the business ""far better future investment prospects and further development opportunities.” 
Lufthansa is also launching a partnership with gategroup that will involve the Zurich-based company providing catering for flights at the airline's Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich hubs. Lufthansa will retain a minority stake in new joint venture companies providing catering in Frankfurt and Munich.

Federal regulators are setting up a new three-digit number to reach a suicide prevention hotline in order to make it easier to seek help and reduce the stigma associated with mental health.
Once it's implemented, people will just need to dial 988 to seek help, similar to calling 911 for emergencies or 311 for city services. Currently, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline uses a 10-digit number, 800-273-TALK (8255). Callers are routed to one of 163 crisis centers, where counselors answered 2.2 million calls last year.
A law last year required the Federal Communications Commission to study assigning a three-digit number for suicide prevention. The FCC         said in a report that there is overwhelming support for a three-digit number because it would be easier for distressed people to get help.
Thursday's vote starts the months-long process to make that happen. The next step is a comment period before the FCC moves to an order.
The government’s action comes as suicide rates have         increased across the U.S. over the past two decades, and dramatically so — by more than 30% — in half of U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 45,000 deaths in 2016. The report noted that from 1999 to 2016, suicide increased in every state except Nevada. It also noted that suicide rates are higher with at-risk populations, including veterans and the LGBTQ community. 
“More than 20 veterans die by suicide every day and more than half a million LGBTQ youth will attempt suicide this year alone,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said. “A shorter, simpler suicide hotline number could be a game-changer.”
The new, shorter number would likely lead to more calls, which in turn would mean more expenses for crisis centers already         struggling to keep up. If the number of calls to the hotline doubled, centers would need an extra $50 million a year to handle the increase, the FCC said, citing the federal agency that funds the hotline, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
The FCC determined that it would be better to have a new number that's only for the hotline, rather than one that's currently used for other purposes, such as 911. Advocates say that having a dedicated number, along with a message that mental health is of equivalent importance as medical emergencies, could help reduce the stigma of calling the number.
“The three-digit number is really going to be a breakthrough in terms of reaching people in a crisis,” said Dwight Holton, CEO of Lines for Life, a suicide prevention nonprofit. “No one is embarrassed to call 911 for a fire or an emergency. No one should be embarrassed to call 988 for a mental health emergency.""
While the increase in calls might cost more, he said, it saves money in the long run because more people will be calling 988 instead of 911, which involves sending first responders and costs thousands of dollars. 
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, said people making calls because of suicidal thoughts can often be helped just by talking them through it, without needing to send a first responder.
Holton added that having first responders present doesn't always help people in crisis because they aren't necessarily trained to deal with mental health issues.
Although 988 won't be available by text, there are other texting services available. Lines for Life offers a text service by texting 273TALK to 839863.

Tufts University severs ties with family behind OxyContin,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tufts-university-severs-ties-family-oxycontin-67526442,"
Tufts University is cutting ties with the billionaire family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, saying it will strip the Sackler name from its campus and accept no further donations amid concerns over the family's role in the opioid crisis.
University officials announced the decision Thursday, ending a relationship that has spanned nearly four decades and brought $15 million to the school’s science and medical programs. Tufts leaders said they considered the issue for more than a year before concluding it is inconsistent with the school's values to display the family's name.
“We had to deal with the reality that the Sackler name has become associated with a health care epidemic. Given our medical school’s mission, we needed to reconcile that,” Peter Dolan, chairman of Tufts’ board of trustees, said in an interview.
Within hours of the announcement, however, the family vowed to fight back.
“We will be seeking to have this improper decision reversed and are currently reviewing all options available to us,” said Daniel Connolly, an attorney for members of the Sackler family. He added that the decision is based on “unproven allegations about the Sackler family and Purdue.”
The change was announced at the same time Tufts released         findings from an outside review examining the school’s ties with the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma. The inquiry, commissioned by the school, found no major wrongdoing but concluded there was an “appearance of too close a relationship between Purdue, the Sacklers and Tufts.”
The family's ties with Tufts date back to 1980, when the three founding brothers of Purdue Pharma provided a donation to establish the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Tufts separately named its medical school building after one of the brothers, Arthur, after he made a donation in 1983.
Arthur Sackler's wife, Jillian, served on the university's board of trustees for a decade starting in 1986. And Richard Sackler, a Purdue board member and former CEO, sat on the medical school’s board of advisers for nearly two decades until he left in 2017.
Officials said the Sackler name will now be dropped from all campus facilities and programs, including the biomedical sciences school, the medical school building, a laboratory and two research funds. Arthur Sackler's name was removed from a sign outside the medical school Thursday.
Jillian Sackler said her late husband, Arthur, deserves no blame.
“Arthur had nothing to do with OxyContin. The man has been dead for 32 years. He did not profit from it, and none of his philanthropic gifts were in any way connected to opioids or to deceptive medical marketing — which he likewise had nothing to do with,” she said in a statement.
Tufts joins a growing number of colleges seeking distance from the Sackler family amid pressure from students and activists. Several have stopped accepting gifts from the family, including Cornell and Yale universities. Others, including Brown University, said they will redirect past donations to support addiction treatment.
An         Associated Press review  in October found that prestigious universities around the world accepted at least $60 million from the Sacklers over the past five years. Some critics say schools should return the money so it can be used to help cities and states harmed by the opioid crisis.
Past donations to Tufts will continue to be used for their original purpose, officials said, but the university will establish a $3 million endowment to support research and education on addiction. The school also plans to create an educational exhibit exploring Tufts’ history with the Sacklers.
Previously known for their philanthropy, the Sacklers have more recently gained attention for their role in the opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma         filed for bankruptcy this year amid thousands of lawsuits accusing it of aggressively pushing OxyContin despite its addiction risks. Some of the suits target individual members of the family, who deny wrongdoing.
Students and faculty at Tufts have long called on the school to sever ties with the Sacklers, especially those in science and medicine programs. Dr. Harris Berman, dean of the medical school, said the building's name had become an “embarrassment.”
“Our alumni, our board of advisers all have been troubled by the fact that we’ve got the Sackler name all over the place,” Berman said. “I think there’s going to be a great sigh of relief among all of them that we’ve finally done the right thing. Certainly I feel that way.”
The move also drew support from a student group that opposed the Sacklers' name on campus, known as Sack Sackler.
“Tufts, to our knowledge, is the first academic institution in the United States to fully cut ties with the Sackler family,” the group said in a statement. “That said, we don’t know of any other university so closely tied to the Sacklers’ campaign of deadly medical misinformation. Still, we’ll take it. This is a big deal.”
Tufts has also faced criticism over its direct ties to Purdue Pharma. In 1999, the company paid to establish a master's program on pain research and education, and continued to fund it for a decade. One of the company's senior executives became a lecturer in the program and was appointed as an adjunct professor.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleged in a January civil complaint that Purdue used the partnership with Tufts to bolster its reputation and promote OxyContin. In response, Tufts’ president ordered the outside review examining the relationship.
The inquiry, led by a former U.S. attorney, found that Purdue and the Sacklers contributed a combined $15 million to Tufts since 1980. Much of the family's funding supported research on cancer and neuroscience.
Investigators found no evidence that the funding significantly skewed Tufts’ research or academic programs, but they believe the family and its company benefited from the relationship in subtler ways.
In 2002, for example, the director of the Tufts pain program appeared in an advertisement for Purdue, with his Tufts affiliation prominently displayed. In 2015, the medical school chose not to assign students to read “Dreamland,” a book on the opioid crisis, largely because it was too critical of the Sacklers, the review found.
“We do believe that Purdue intended to use the relationship with Tufts to advance its own interests and, in a few particular instances, there is some evidence that it was successful in exercising influence,” the report found.
Tufts leaders say they plan to implement a slate of recommendations included in the report. It called for “heightened scrutiny” of donors, greater transparency surrounding research donors, and the creation of a committee to review large gifts that ""raise questions of conflicts of interest, reputational risk for the university or other controversy.”

The U.N.’s trade and development agency estimates that Europe, led by the Netherlands, leads the world in readiness for online shopping.
UNCTAD’s annual business-to-consumer e-commerce         index ranked the United States again in the teens, at 13th - largely because of its relatively low share of people using the Internet compared to other developed countries.
Russia ranked 40th and China 56th while Hong Kong came in at No. 15.
The agency said Tuesday over 80% of Internet users in six European countries shop online, versus under 10% in some poorer countries.
The rankings are based on use of the Internet as well as access to secure internet servers, reliable postal services, and financial institution or mobile-money-service providers.

Local union leaders send Fiat Chrysler contract to members,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/local-union-leaders-vote-fiat-chrysler-contract-67501706,"
Union leaders from Fiat Chrysler factories are sending a new four-year contract to a membership vote. 
The 47,000 members of the United Auto Workers union at the company will vote on the deal starting Friday. 
Local leaders assembled on Wednesday in Detroit to go over the pact, which includes a $9,000 bonus per worker upon ratification. The company also has promised $4.5 billion worth of new investments in U.S. factories. 
The union reached agreement with Fiat Chrysler last weekend. The new contract also offers a mix of lump sums and pay raises for longtime workers, full top wages for new hires within four years and a path for temporary employees to become full-time after three years of work.
The Fiat Chrysler contract also adds 12.5% to the union workers' profit-sharing formula, giving them $900 per 1% of profit margin generated North American. That's up from $800, and a $12,000 cap was lifted. The UAW says the deal created more than 7,900 jobs, including a $4.5 billion investment previously announced at two factories in Detroit.
Fiat Chrysler is the last of the Detroit automakers to settle with the union. Workers at General Motors ratified their contract Oct. 31, ending a 40-day strike that paralyzed GM's U.S. factories. Ford workers followed by approving a contract in November. 
In a summary of the contract, the union said FCA agreed to extend a moratorium on outsourcing of jobs and will maintain its U.S. manufacturing presence through the life of the contract.
The $9 billion of factory investment includes $4.5 billion previously announced at two factories in Detroit, including a new assembly plant.
Also included is an agreement to build fresh models off the Jeep Cherokee SUV underpinnings and invest $55 million into the Belvidere, Illinois, assembly plant, where the Cherokee is built.
At the Toledo, Ohio, North Assembly plant, which builds the Jeep Wrangler SUV, the company will invest $160 million and hire 100 more people to build a plug-in hybrid version of the Wrangler. The Toledo South plant gets $120 million to keep building the Jeep Gladiator pickup.
At an assembly plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Fiat Chrysler will invest $210 million to keep building light-duty Ram pickup and new high-performance version of the truck.
Another truck plant in Warren, Michigan, will get $2.8 billion including engineering and development expenses to keep building the Ram pickup and a new three-row SUV called the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. A plug-in hybrid version of the SUV is coming in 2021.
Mike Booth, president of a UAW local in Marysville, Michigan, north of Detroit, said he made a plea to the leaders at the meeting  to reject the deal. Although there was some dissent, the contract was approved on a voice vote, he said.
Under the contract, Booth's factory, which makes truck axles, would be transferred by Fiat Chrysler to auto parts supply company ZF-TRW. The plant's 800 workers are Fiat Chrysler employees and will have to transfer to jobs in Detroit.
Booth alleges that corrupt union officials who were bribed by the company agreed to the change. The union local has sued the international UAW and Fiat Chrysler in an effort to block the transfer.
The International UAW has been rocked by a bribery and embezzlement scandal that began at the jointly run Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center. Two former vice presidents who negotiated with FCA are alleged by federal officials to have taken bribes to influence contract negotiations."
"PG&E urges judge to approve key settlement, faces resistance",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pge-urges-judge-approve-key-settlement-faces-resistance-67505425,"
Pacific Gas & Electric on Wednesday urged a federal bankruptcy judge to approve a key insurance settlement as it struggles to regain its financial footing and cover at least $20 billion in losses stemming from catastrophic wildfires in California tied to its equipment.
The nation's largest utility faced fierce resistance at the court hearing from attorneys representing thousands of wildfire victims, PG&E bondholders who have proposed an alternative plan for salvaging the hobbled company and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
The opposition argued that         PG&E's $11 billion settlement with a group representing about 110 insurers that have already paid claims in the fires threatens to shortchange uninsured and underinsured victims. Critics also say the deal would give the company an unfair advantage to gain support for its deeply flawed reorganization plan.
Nancy Mitchell, an attorney, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali that PG&E’s current rehabilitation plan doesn’t meet the standards required to participate in a wildfire fund approved by California lawmakers last summer. Even so, Mitchell contended PG&E is hoping approval of the insurance settlement will give it the leverage to pressure voting stakeholders to approve its plan, which must happen by June 30 for the utility if it hopes to have future wildfire losses partially covered by the state's new fund.
“They want to lock up the votes and then want to say, ‘OK, state, you have no choice’’” but to approve the plan, Mitchell said. Besides getting Montali's blessing, PG&E's plan also has to be approved by its chief regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission.
PG&E lawyer Stephen Karotkin tried to assure Montali that the insurance settlement is the best way to fairly treat all the parties affected by the San Francisco company’s 10-month-old bankruptcy case.
“We don’t want to take the risk that this thing blows up,” Karotkin said.
Both PG&E and insurers have framed a settlement reached in September as a great deal because the $11 billion payment represents about 55 percent of the amount the carriers could seek if they sued the utility for the damages caused by its equipment and practices.i Insurers have paid out nearly $16 billion of the roughly $20 billion that they expect to cover in the fires linked to PG&E.
“If this deal goes away, we are back to the drawing board,” said Matthew Feldman, a lawyer for the insurers involved in the PG&E settlement.
The insurers have set a Friday deadline for getting court approval of the PG&E settlement, although Feldman told Montali that date could be extended if the judge needed more time to issue a ruling. Montali said he would try to issue a decision promptly.
PG&E’s proposed all-cash payment to the insurers has raised fears that the company won’t have anywhere near enough money to cover all the other claims that have poured in from more than 70,000 victims in fires that erupted during the autumns of 2017 and 2018, killing more than 120 people and destroying nearly 28,000 homes and buildings. 
Attorneys for the fire victims are worried they could end up being forced to accept stock in a financially rehabilitated PG&E that could turn out to be horrible investment.
Although it didn't come up in Wednesday's hearing, Newsom has been pressing PG&E to revise its plan to reserve $13.5 billion to cover fire victims beyond those included in the $11 billion settlement, matching the amount earmarked in the bondholders' competing proposal. PG&E's plan currently calls for the victims getting an additional $7.5 billion, not including government agencies with claims.
Newsom may have gained more negotiating leverage with the         recent release of an exhaustive report from the California Public Utilities Commission that concluded PG&E repeatedly neglected to maintain a power line blamed for igniting a 2018 fire that nearly wiped out the city of Paradise.
Although a state wildfire agency had already held PG&E responsible for that deadly blaze, the more extensive findings by the utility’s main regulator could provide Newsom with more fodder to follow through on recent threats to mount a bid to turn the utility into a nonprofit cooperative owned by its customers
Media reports that PG&E was nearing an agreement to meet Newsom's demands caused the company's stock to surge 11% Wednesday to close at $9.47. That remains far below a high of $71.57 in September 2017, reached just before the first of the major wildfires erupted and began raising doubts about PG&E's future."
UnitedHealth plans bargain bid for Diplomat Pharmacy,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/unitedhealth-plans-bargain-bid-diplomat-pharmacy-67599423,"
UnitedHealth plans to acquire Diplomat Pharmacy at a steep discount about a month after the specialty drug provider said it may not be able to make its debt payments.
United Health Group's OptumRx said Monday that the company will spend $4 for each share of Diplomat in a cash tender offer. That’s 31% cheaper than the stock’s closing price of $5.81 on Friday. Shares of Diplomat tumbled in early trading.
Diplomat provides specialty drugs that treat cancer patients and others with complex medical conditions. It also offers infusion services. The company said Nov. 12 that it lost $177 million in the third quarter, and it was in advanced discussions about strategic alternatives for its business.
Diplomat said then that it had been hurt by larger competitors, and it couldn’t renew a deal to stay in the specialty pharmacy and retail networks of a big payer it did not name.
Specialty drugs are big business for pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. Insurers and employers see these expensive drugs as a major factor behind rising health care costs, and they are focusing more on managing the cost of the drugs and where they are administered.
OptumRx is one of the nation’s largest PBMs.
The offer for Diplomat amounts to about $304 million. Diplomat had about $563 million in net debt as of last month, which pushes the total deal price closer to $900 million.
Board members at Diplomat Pharmacy Inc., based in of Flint, Michigan, have unanimously approved the deal.
Shares of Diplomat dropped nearly 32 percent to $3.97 in Monday morning trading. Shares of Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc., a Dow Jones industrial average component, slipped $1.24 to $278.95. Broader markets were mixed."
2-year old Arthur becomes star in UK Christmas ad tradition,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/year-arthur-star-uk-christmas-ad-tradition-67552011,"
Little Arthur crawls out of bed in his red Marvel Comics pajamas, brushes his teeth and strolls outside after breakfast to his day job: helping out at the family hardware store in Rhayader, Wales. It's Christmas and Arthur, nearly 3, has his work cut out for him wrapping presents, hanging ornaments and helping customers.
But the cute video with 1.3 million views on YouTube - and counting - comes with a larger larger message. Don't forget the little guy.
“The small little family owned businesses still exist out there,'' said Arthur's dad, Thomas Lewis Jones, 30. ''If you can afford to shop locally, do so. If you can’t. I hope you just enjoy the video.''
Big Christmas ads have become a tradition in Britain — an opportunity usually for much larger companies to pull out all the stops to woo holiday shoppers and stamp their brands firmly on the consumer brain. These are usually mini movies, similar to Super Bowl showstoppers in the United States, that feature warm and fuzzy characters like lovestruck penguins and mythical creatures who reveal the true meaning of Christmas.
These ads don't normally originate in a town 200 miles from London and have a budget of 100 pounds ($130).
Yet this simple, day in the life of Arthur         promotional video has drawn attention to much larger problems of bricks and mortar U.K. retailers this Christmas, struggling as they do with issues ranging from the steady losses to internet retailers to a controversial local tax system whose reform is constantly discussed.
Despite initiatives, such as Small Business Saturday, stores really are facing challenges. They are often dwarfed by the bigger stores that can offer better prices and more selection. Many have a tough time getting through each year.
“What this video has done is throw into the spotlight the very real challenges that smaller firms throughout the U.K. are actually facing,'' said Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. “They are facing spiraling business rates, high rents and online competition, expensive town center parking and the loss of bank branches and ATMs. All of these issues make for a perfect storm that is putting many small businesses at risk.”
Jones, who runs Hafod Hardware, simply made Arthur his go-to star to promote the store. Arthur's supporting cast is his grandfather, John, his great-grandfather Alan and his great-grandmother Pauline. The filmmaker, Josh Holdaway, is a family friend and has a cameo appearance.
Since being posted Monday, Jones' phone has not stopped ringing. At the time he was speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, he noted with some degree of astonishment that the video was popular in Japan. It's also big in Australia. And Morocco - and so on. 
But for Jones, it was a movie for his neighbors, too. 
“People have been coming in this morning saying congratulations... they've been bringing in bottles of champagne for us to say well done,” he told Britain's Press Association. “”The locals are incredible, they're our bread and butter. We're very lucky to have the community we have here in Rhayader."" 
The ad ends with Arthur transforming into his father in the act of putting the Christmas tree on his shoulder. It urges everyone to to “#Be a Kid this Christmas.'' 
“You get an experience when you go into a shop like ours,'' Jones said. “You get personal service.''"
Trump against the world: A snapshot of his trade disputes,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-world-snapshot-trade-disputes-67471777,"
There are lots of ways, it seems, to land on one of President Donald Trump’s tariff hit lists.
Countries can allegedly steal U.S. trade secrets. Or they can introduce a tax that the Trump administration doesn’t like. Or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall.
Making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of U.S. policy in favor of a pugnacious America-first approach, Trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against America’s trading partners. He’s also strived to replace a 25-year-old North American trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking. So far, though, he’s been stymied by the U.S. Congress.
Here’s a look at some of the major items on Trump’s trade agenda:
———
A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA
For the past 17 months, the world’s top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s.
The Trump administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world’s supreme leader in such cutting-edge industries as robotics and driverless cars. The administration, backed by many U.S. business groups, alleges that China steals technology, forces U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes China’s tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape.
Trump has also railed against America’s gaping trade deficit with China: $380 billion last year.
The president has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and plans to tax an additional $160 billion in goods on Dec. 15 — a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything China ships to the United States. Beijing has hit $120 billion in U.S. products with retaliatory tariffs.
Thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough. Beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration.
In October, the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved: Trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some Chinese goods. Beijing agreed to buy large quantities of U.S. farm exports.
But they have failed to finalize that so-called Phase 1 agreement. And on Tuesday, Trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election.

METALS MAYHEM
Last year, Trump unsheathed a little-used weapon in U.S. trade policy — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to America’s national security. Using that justification, he imposed tariffs of 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum.
But he exempted several countries. Argentina and Brazil, for instance, avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the U.S.
With one early-morning tweet Monday, Trump demolished that arrangement. He accused Argentina and Brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets.
It’s true that Brazil’s real and the Argentina’s peso have plummeted against the U.S. dollar. But it’s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation. Rather, it’s because their economies are in crisis:
Brazil is contending with double-digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession. Argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation, huge debts and widespread poverty.
———
NAFTA 2.0
Trump last year browbeat Mexico and Canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But his version — the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA — still awaits approval from the U.S. Congress.
Having taken effect in 1994, the original NAFTA erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc. Many U.S. manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low-wage Mexican labor and ship products back to the United States, duty-free. Trump and other critics accused NAFTA of wiping out American manufacturing jobs.
Trump warned that if he couldn’t negotiate a better deal, he’d kill NAFTA altogether. USMCA emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations. The revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the United States.
Among other things, it requires that 40% to 45% of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal’s duty-free status.
But House Democrats, who must approve USMCA, insist that Trump’s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced. They’ve been negotiating changes with Trump’s top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, but have yet to resolve their differences.
———
FRANCE’S TECH TAX
The administration on Monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on cheese, wine, lipstick and other French imports, collectively worth $2.4 billion. The reason: France last summer passed a digital services tax that targets American tech giants such as Amazon and Google.
The French tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low-tax European Union countries. It imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros.
The Trump administration has also criticized the French tax for targeting companies’ revenue, not their profits, and for being retroactive.
French President Emmanuel Macron has threatened a robust “response’’ from Europe if the U.S. proceeds with the tariffs.
———
TAXING FOREIGN CARS
At Trump’s request, the Commerce Department launched an investigation into auto imports — and then dutifully declared that they, too, posed a threat to America’s national security. That could clear the way for Trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts.
Auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in Trump’s protectionist policies. The United States last year imported $192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and $159 billion in auto parts. Virtually no one outside the White House supports the tariffs. Imposing them would widen a rift with Europe and risk a backlash in Congress, where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president’s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds.
Trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of Japan and the European Union. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that Trump vowed to forgo tariffs on Japan’s cars as part of a mini-trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year.
In May, Trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with Japan and the EU. As mid-November approached, Trump said he’d decide on the tariffs “very soon.’’
But the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration.

Now Roquefort: US eyes tariffs on $2.4B in French imports,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/now-roquefort-us-eyes-tariffs-24b-french-imports-67451391,"
The Trump administration is proposing tariffs on up to $2.4 billion worth of French imports — including Roquefort cheese, handbags, lipstick and sparkling wine — in retaliation for France’s tax on American tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative charged Monday that France’s new digital services tax discriminates against U.S. companies. The trade office will accept public comments on the tariffs, which could hit 100%, through Jan. 6 and hold a hearing Jan. 7.
The French tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by putting headquarters in low-tax European Union countries. It imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenues of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros.
The U.S. also criticized the French tax for targeting companies’ revenue, not their profits, and for being retroactive.
The decision to pursue tariffs “sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on U.S. companies,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.
His agency investigated the French tax under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 — the same provision the Trump administration used last year to probe China's technology policies, leading to tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports in the biggest trade war since the 1930s.
Lighthizer warned that the U.S. is also exploring whether to pursue Section 301 investigations into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey.
The decision to target France got bipartisan endorsement from Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden. In a joint statement, they assailed the French digital tax as “unreasonable, protectionist and discriminatory.”
The tech trade group ITI said it welcomed the administration’s decision and urged continued negotiations on international taxes under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The tariff announcement is likely to increase tension between the United States and Europe. The U.S. is already readying tariffs on $7.5 billion in EU imports over illegal subsidies for the European aircraft giant Airbus. The World Trade Organization on Monday         gave the U.S. a greenlight to impose those levies, ruling that the EU had not complied with an order to end the subsidies.
And in another reminder that Washington’s trade conflicts extend well beyond a 16-month standoff with China, President Donald Trump on Monday pledge to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum         from Brazil and Argentina.
Both South American nations were among a group of U.S. allies that Trump exempted from steel and aluminum tariffs in March 2018. The American president’s threat to reverse that decision and impose the metals tariffs is the latest example of his mercurial approach to trade policy.
Trump accused the countries of manipulating their currencies lower to make their exports less expensive in world markets and gain an unfair trade advantage.
But the countries’ weak currencies reflect their weak economies. Brazil is contending with double-digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession. Argentina is battling an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation, huge debts and widespread poverty."
Iconic Southern rock recording studio is revived in Georgia,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/iconic-southern-rock-recording-studio-revived-georgia-67467227,"
The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn.
Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s.
Capricorn’s historic Studio A is reopening this week, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology.
“It’s a place that spawned a decade of remarkable creative activity,” Mercer President William Underwood said in an interview.
It also helped make Macon one of the nation’s music capitals. Underwood hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon’s place among cities that forged the music history of the United States — places like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans.
Macon’s civic leaders view Southern rock through a far different lens these days than in the 1970s.
Southern rockers and Southern Baptists traveled in different orbits back then. The Capricorn music scene — part of the drug-infused counterculture movement of the time — was not always welcome in conservative Middle Georgia.
Now, Capricorn and Southern rock are officially sanctioned by today’s leaders, many of whom were fans in their younger days. Underwood, for instance, grew up listening to Southern rock and considers The Allman Brothers Band “the greatest jam band ever.”
In planning the new music complex, Underwood and others visited music hubs including Nashville, where Elvis Presley and others recorded their hits in RCA’s Studio B.
“There are people all over the world who travel to see these restored studios,” said Larry Brumley, a senior vice president at Mercer.
Macon-area officials hope the restoration — funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors — will help spur downtown redevelopment.
The restored Macon studio is part of         Mercer Music at Capricorn, a 20,000-square-foot (1,860-square-meter) complex that will include a museum. Among its goals: To train and inspire new musicians. To that end, the         Capricorn Music Incubator will provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft.
The idea is “to be a place to bring talented, creative people together and have them interact and engage with one another,” Underwood said.
“One day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,” he said.
Redding’s voice became emblematic of Macon music six decades ago, after Mercer University student Phil Walden discovered his vocal talents while booking local bands for fraternity parties.
In 1969, Capricorn Records was formed by Walden and others, including Frank Fenton and producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.
“My father loved the South, he loved Georgia and he especially loved Macon,” Phil Walden’s daughter, Amantha, said at Tuesday’s dedication ceremony. “He loved Southern music deep inside his soul.”
“My father’s life mission was to show the world what the South was capable of, and today we are here to celebrate a chapter of that mission,” she added.
Walden, his brother Alan Walden and their business partners discovered new artists who went on to create what became Southern rock.
The Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie and others recorded songs inside the studio that was built for the Capricorn record label.
The Allman Brothers Band became so popular that they helped a former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election by performing at campaign events, Carter has said. Carter told Mercer graduates at their 2016 commencement that he might not have been elected if the band hadn’t “adopted” him.
“Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,”         Carter said in 2017. “The band got the campaign political attention and raised much needed funds.”
When Underwood became Mercer’s president, the vacant offices that once housed Capricorn were a shambles, with one exception.
“The studio itself — that magical place where this great music was made — was still intact,” Underwood recalled. “It was kind of a miracle.”
A second venue, Studio B, will be used for larger-scale recordings and to host concerts and other special events. Film scores could be recorded there, tying into Georgia’s booming movie industry, Underwood said.
The studio will also feature a custom-built, 40-channel analog sound board that was created by the Maryland-based company API, he said.
Wes Griffith, who now manages the newly restored studio, recalls the first time he stepped inside.
“I was in awe, standing there where all these great things happened, all this great music was made,” Griffith said. “It’s just a dream come true for me to be the steward of that place and share that history and start a new beginning.”"
White Castle recalls some burgers due to possible listeria,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/white-castle-issues-voluntary-recall-burgers-due-listeria/story?id=67609585,"
White Castle has issued a voluntary recall of a ""limited number"" of its frozen six-pack cheeseburgers, frozen six-pack hamburgers, frozen six-pack jalapeno cheeseburgers and 16-pack hamburgers and 16-pack cheeseburgers due to a ""possible presence"" of listeria, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA said on Friday that the recall affected products on shelves at selected retailers with best-by dates ranging from Aug. 4, 2020 to Aug. 17, 2020.
""Any product with these dates on shelves is presently being removed. Any product with a best-by date before or after these best-by dates is not included in the voluntary recall,"" the FDA said.

The agency said there had been no reported illnesses linked to the recalled products.
""White Castle conducts frequent and regular quality assurance tests,"" the FDA said. ""A recent sample conducted by a third party laboratory of its frozen sandwiches from one manufacturing facility showed a presence of Listeria monocytogenes halting any shipment of product to customers. Since the problem was identified White Castle has not shipped any product from this facility to customers. Following rigorous safety testing protocols, all impacted production runs have been identified for destruction. White Castle has maintained complete control of all product produced at the facility since the first indication of a problem.""
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA.

Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

Consumers who may have bought the products listed in the recall were urged to throw them out or return them to the store for an exchange or refund. They can also contact White Castle at 1-800-843-2728."
"Uber reveals nearly 6,000 incidents of sexual assaults in new safety report",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/uber-reveals-6000-incidents-sexual-assaults-safety-report/story?id=67538499,"
Uber says it received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault from both riders and drivers across the United States in 2017 and 2018.

The San Francisco-based ride-hailing company voluntarily released the information, among other data, in its first-ever safety report on Thursday.

In 2017, Uber recorded 2,936 reports of sexual assault during a total of 1 billion trips throughout the United States. There were 3,045 reported sexual assaults the following year during 1.3 billion total trips.
Overall, riders accounted for 45% of the accused parties. The report noted that some assaults occurred between riders.

Among the sexual assault incidents, the company counted 464 reports of rape in 2017 and 2018. About 92% of the victims were riders and roughly 7% were drivers. Women and female-identifying individuals comprised 89% of the victims, while men and male-identifying individuals made up about 8%.
Uber said it saw a decrease of approximately 16% in the average incident rate of sexual assaults reported from 2017 to 2018. However, as its report noted, sexual assaults are often not reported, so the actual numbers could be much higher.

""I suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they’re still too common,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said of the new report via Twitter. ""Some people will appreciate how much we’ve done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right.""

During 2017 and 2018, 19 people died in physical assaults that occurred in Uber-related incidents. There were also 107 motor vehicle fatalities from Uber-related crashes in the same time frame.
""Most companies don’t talk about these hard issues, and they don’t share data about serious safety incidents. We believe it’s time for a new approach,"" Uber said in a statement announcing the report. ""Keeping this information in the dark doesn’t make anyone safer.""

The 84-page report comes as Uber faces scrutiny regarding safety concerns. Last week, London's transit authority refused to renew the company's license to operate in the British capital, citing ""a pattern of failures by the company"" that ""placed passengers and their safety at risk."" Uber said it plans to appeal the decision.

Over the past year, Uber has partnered with sexual assault prevention networks and other safety groups. Uber has also added new safety features, including more rigorous background checks, an in-app emergency button, and technology that allows the company to check in with customers if it detects a potential crash or an unexpected long stop during a trip.

American Airlines hopes new kitchen will cut delays at DFW,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/american-airlines-hopes-kitchen-cut-delays-dfw-67504668,"
American Airlines is providing another reason for its high number of delayed flights this summer — an antiquated, overworked kitchen at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
American says 2,300 flights were delayed between Memorial Day and Labor Day so that food and drinks could be prepared and loaded on the planes. That is more than 20 delays a day during the peak summer travel season.
American says catering-related delays at DFW have been getting worse for years, and it has a solution: a new $100 million kitchen.
The DFW Airport board is scheduled to vote on the project Thursday after hearing a presentation earlier this week. 
“The current catering kitchen was built in 1982 and is too small and inefficient for today's needs,” airline spokeswoman Annie Lorenzana said. “A new kitchen is critical to enable future expansion,” including when a new, sixth terminal that opens as soon as 2025.
American is the dominant carrier at DFW, operating more than 900 flights a day. The airline outsources catering to LSG Sky Chefs.
If the airport board approves the project, American will negotiate a 40-year lease for more than 21 acres to house a new kitchen and related facilities. It would pay an estimated $39 million in rent over the life of the lease, in addition to the upfront costs, according to airport documents.
American has struggled with more than 30,000 delays at DFW this year. Airline executives blamed the operational problems this summer at DFW and other airports on the grounding of American's 24 Boeing Max jets and an illegal work slowdown by union mechanics. 
Plans for the new kitchen were first reported by The Dallas Morning News. "
"Season’s greetings at Sears: Dingy shops, sparse shelves",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/seasons-sears-dingy-shops-sparse-shelves-67493739,"
Nearly 10 months out of bankruptcy, Sears is limping into the holiday shopping season.
Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire         who promised to save 425 Sears and Kmart stores and roughly 45,000 jobs when he bought the company out of bankruptcy, has seen his $5.2 billion lifeline wither. 
While there were plans for new small stores centered on appliances, only three have opened. The chain is still shrinking. By February, the store count will be down to 182.
Many of the stores that remain have the same old problems. They’re grungy and understaffed, poorly stocked and losing vendors. At the end of the year — a crucial time for retailers — Sears’ threadbare Black Friday catalog signals it’s going to have problems getting shoppers to its doors. And online, it can’t compete with Amazon and its traditional rivals.
“They used to be top of mind, particularly during this time of year,” said Coye Nokes, a partner at OC & C Strategy Consultants. “Now, they’ve faded into the landscape. They’ve become irrelevant.”
The ever-shrinking Sears means more job losses. Thousands of jobs are gone, although Sears’ owner through a spokesman declined to say how many since Lampert bought the company out of bankruptcy in February. There are fewer choices for shoppers and suppliers. It also puts more pressure on malls, which must figure out how to fill the gaping holes left by Sears.
Lampert’s failure comes as no surprise to industry experts. He was the only buyer who offered Sears a lifeline at all — other bidders just wanted to liquidate the chain — but he had already presided over a long decline of Sears going back more than a decade.
The signs at Sears are ominous heading into the holidays, when retailers acquire new customers.
Black Friday was bleak at its store in Jersey City, New Jersey, where an unplugged Christmas tree sat on top of a round table by the entrance. Few shoppers were in the store and the toy section had no Legos or Hatchimals, even though signs indicated they would be there.
A store needs to have stuff on its shelves to attract customers, and Sears is having issues with some suppliers cutting it off. One vendor, Stolaas, has stopped selling refurbished Apple gadgets on Sears’ website because it wasn’t getting paid, said David Wander, a bankruptcy attorney at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron who represents Stolaas.
The supplier issue is showing up in Sears’ advertising. Its revised circular for Black Friday had eight pages of deals, less than a quarter of the size last year, according to Edgar Dworsky, founder and editor of Boston-based consumer advocacy website Consumer World. None were for major electronics — one of the reasons people used to go to Sears.
Lands’ End, a clothing brand that was once a big draw when Sears purchased it in 2002 but was spun off in 2014, is nearing the end of its remaining leases, due to expire next month. Now, Lands’ End clothing is on clearance, and Sears was even selling its mannequins at the Jersey City store for $75, with an additional 60% Black Friday discount. Empty paint cans were marked down to $2 each with the discount.
Peter Doliente  bought himself a Seiko watch at the store for $200, down from $500.
“There’s not much customers around,” the teacher from Jersey City said. “I was surprised when I went to the parking lot. Normally it would be packed at this time.”
Sears once towered over the retail landscape but has been on a slow decline for years. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, pledging to return Sears to greatness. That didn’t happen. Sears was hit hard during the recession a decade ago and never recovered.
Selling well-known brands, like its Craftsman tools, and spinning off stores were cash infusions that helped Sears survive. Lampert lent some money of his own, but critics say he never invested in the stores, which grew increasingly dingy.
Even after all of Sears’ pain, Lampert argued during its bankruptcy that he was its best chance. Industry experts remain skeptical of his ability to revive Sears, saying he is still neglecting stores. 
“I don’t think this was a surprise to anyone,” said Scott Stuart, CEO of Turnaround Management Association, whose members include corporate turnaround experts and store liquidators. “It was more a surprise that (Lampert) publicly determined that this was something salvageable.”
In a statement, Transform Holdco, the owner of Sears managed by Lampert, said that it “faced a difficult retail environment and other challenges” and it’s working to “prune its operations.” The company said in November that it got another $250 million in financing.
That’s no solace to employees like Victor Urquidez, the assistant manager at a Sears Auto Center in Chula Vista, California, who said he will be losing his job when the store closes in late December.
“We were expecting it,” said Urquidez, who has watched deliveries shrink from 100 tires at a time two years ago to nine today. “We knew it was going to happen.”
What comes next for Sears? There’s little optimism. While there are plenty of vendors still sending in goods, the rescue plan has barely begun and shoppers simply have far better options elsewhere.
“It’s dead man walking,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy. “It’s entirely possible that next Christmas, Sears won’t be around as currently structured.”

Minnesota sues e-cigarette maker Juul over youth vaping rise,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/minnesota-sues-cigarette-maker-juul-youth-vaping-rise-67499661,"
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Juul Labs on Wednesday, accusing the e-cigarette maker of unlawfully targeting young people with its products to get a new generation addicted to nicotine.
The lawsuit filed in Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis seeks to force Juul to stop marketing to young people; fund a corrective public education campaign in Minnesota on the dangers of youth vaping; fund vaping cessation programs; disclose all its research on vaping and health; and surrender all profits from its allegedly unlawful conduct.
“They have deceived and misled Minnesota consumers of all ages, creating a public nuisance, and especially harmed our young people,"" Ellison said at a news conference with Gov. Tim Walz. “Juul is by far the dominant e-cigarette manufacturer in America, and it's growing fast.”
Ellison declined to put a dollar figure on how much money the state will seek in damages and civil penalties. But he said it could be in line with the state's landmark $7 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in 1998. He said the San Francisco-based company followed “Big Tobacco's playbook” of marketing to young people.
Juul issued a statement saying it's “working cooperatively"" with attorneys general, regulators and other stakeholders to prevent underage use of its products and to switch adult smokers away from conventional cigarettes. The company said it recently stopped accepting orders for mint-flavored pods in the U.S. and suspended all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the country.
“Our customer base is the world's 1 billion adult smokers and we do not intend to attract underage users,"" the statement said.
Juul Labs — which is          facing a growing number of state and federal investigations into its marketing and sales — is about         one-third owned by tobacco giant Altria, the maker of Marlboro and other popular brands.
The Minnesota lawsuit is separate from         lawsuits filed by several other states in the last two weeks.
Ellison said Juul created a public nuisance and violated Minnesota's consumer protection laws by developing “products with higher, more potent and more addictive doses of nicotine than conventional cigarettes, and other e-cigarettes, then not only failed to disclose that to its customers, but represented that its products were safe alternatives to cigarettes.""
Walz said Juul knew the harm when it deliberately targeted Minnesota's children “for simple greed and simple profit.” Using the money Minnesota received under the 1998 settlement, he said, the state brought youth tobacco use way down “until the scourge of vaping"" came along.
The attorney general's office hired two outside law firms, Robbins Kaplan and Zimmerman Reed, to represent the state. Robbins Kaplan also represented Minnesota in the epic litigation that led to the 1998 settlement, which forced the industry to turn over millions of pages of previously undisclosed documents on its practices.
Walz and Ellison warned that the new lawsuit could take years and draw an army of high-priced company lawyers, as the 1998 case did.
“And they will use their merchant of death playbook to tell us we're bad parents, to tell us we have bad kids, to tell us that we should have known,"" Walz said “... But my message to Juul if they're listening today is, you can hire your attorneys, you will have your day in court, but we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota down on Juul.""

Corrects quote in last paragraph. Walz said “but we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota down on Juul,"" rather than “but we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota upon you."""
Massive coal mine sparks international dispute,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/massive-polish-coal-mine-sparks-international-dispute-67541822,"
Polluted air, noise, dry wells. 
The Turow lignite coal mine in Poland is causing trouble for the environment and local communities - even in Germany and Czech Republic, whose border is just a short walk away. Plans to further expand the huge open pit mine have caused alarm among residents who fear things might get even worse.
With Poland set to remain heavily reliant on coal for energy, the state-controlled PGE utility is aiming to extend until 2044 its license to mine in Turow, due to expire in March. 
The move has spawned a rare diplomatic dispute with the Czech government, a longtime ally. And it comes in the face of the United Nation’s call to cut greenhouse gas emissions immediately and sharply. 
“What they do is horrible,” said Milan Starec from the tiny Czech village of Uhelna. The village is two kilometers from the mine, but that distance would be almost halved if the mine is expanded. And a piece of land with a forest that currently forms a natural barrier and keeps the mine out of sight would disappear. 
“From a human point of view, there’s no place whatsoever for (the mine) here. It should end,” said Starec. 
Lignite, a low-grade form of coal, is a fossil fuel that produces large amounts of the greenhouse gases that are warming the atmosphere. Scientists say coal use has to end by 2050 to curb global warming. 
Most of the lignite is burned in the Turow power plant located just next to the mine. The plant ranked as the 19th biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the EU last year and as the 10th-worst coal EU plant for its impact on human health in 2017, according to the Europe Beyond Coal environmental group. The rest is sold to households and businesses, contributing to a thick smog in the nearby Polish town of Bogatynia. 
The mine is set to increase its surface area to 30 sq. kilometers (11.7 sq. miles) and would extend to just 70 meters (230 feet) from the Czech border. The bottom will be 330 meters (1,083 feet) below the surrounding surface. 
One big worry is that expanding the mine is expected to drain away ground water, depriving Uhelna and other communities. 
That has already happened in Vaclavice, a village in a valley near Uhelna that dates to 14th century. The local wells provided enough water for centuries until it began to disappear in recent years. 
Michael Martin, who has lived there for 20 years, says there is just enough water in his well for his family of four to take a quick shower in the morning, after which they are left with nothing for the rest of the day. The problem is shared by other residents. 
“Something is wrong,” says Martin. “It doesn’t happen in the 21st century in a developed country.” 
A Czech study suggests that the Polish plan would put at risk water supplies for some 30,000 people. Local authorities are working to finalize a plan for a new water network but it’s not clear that it can be built in time. 
The Czech Environment Ministry objected to the Polish project in November based on its environmental impact and set a series of conditions like ensuring water supplies. If the Czech requests are ignored, the country could file complaints or lawsuits at the EU level. Some 5,000 Czechs also sent complaints to Poland. 
Polish President Andrzej Duda visited the Turow mine on Saturday to celebrate Miners’ Day and show support. 
He acknowledged Poland will need to reduce its use of coal but also said a shift should allow for the ""reasonable use of our natural resources.” 
“Let’s keep looking for new energy sources, let’s continue our research, but we should not accept the point of view saying that we must completely do away with our industry tomorrow,” Duda said. “We will not be forced into that.” 
It is rare for the two countries to have this level of a diplomatic dispute, particularly on environmental policies. In June, they joined forces to block a European Union proposal to make the bloc's economy carbon neutral by 2050. 
Poland relies on coal for 80% of its energy and the government aims to reduce that very gradually, to a still hefty 60% by 2040, as coal mining is one of the nation’s biggest employers. 
The head of the Solidarity trade union, Piotr Duda, said that becoming carbon neutral by 2050, as the EU proposed, would mean a “disaster not only for Poland’s mining and energy sector but for all of Poland’s economy and for the individual consumer.” 
The wind turbines that dot the nearby hills in Germany and the Czech Republic contrast sharply with the open pit mine and the power plant in Poland, but the Czechs and Germans are also big coal users. 
Germany gets about a third of its electricity from coal but has been taking major steps to change that and is planning to stop burning coal for electricity by 2038. The Czechs get about 40% of their energy from coal and the government wants to wean the country off it, though it has yet to set a target date. 
Poland has closed some mines but is planning to open new ones. 
“It is hard to imagine that the current government would be against the mine expansion,” said Kuba Gogolewski of the Polish foundation called ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO."" 
Pavel Farsky, deputy mayor in the town Hradek nad Nisou, said it’s unlikely that the Polish would address the Czech concerns. 
“An ideal option would be that there is no expansion of the mine, the mining stops, and we live in a normal environment,” Farsky said. “But that’s utopia.” 
Across the border, in a German town called Zittau that is located just a few hundred meters (yards) from the mine, activist Horst Schiermeyer shared that view. 
“It is absurd if the burning of lignite here continues for another 25 years.”

Amazon says Trump's 'improper pressure' doomed Pentagon bid,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amazon-trumps-improper-pressure-doomed-pentagon-bid-67600255,"
Amazon says President Donald Trump's “improper pressure"" and behind-the-scenes attacks harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.
The Pentagon         awarded the cloud computing contract to Microsoft in October.
Amazon argues in a         lawsuit unsealed Monday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that the decision should be revisited because of “substantial and pervasive errors"" and Trump's interference.
Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos are a frequent target of Trump. Bezos personally owns The Washington Post, which Trump has referred to as “fake news” whenever unfavorable stories are published about him.
Amazon said it lost the deal due to Trump's “personal vendetta against Mr. Bezos, Amazon, and the Washington Post.”
Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith said in a statement Monday the decision to select Microsoft “was made by an expert team of career public servants and military officers"" and without external influence. 
Formally called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure plan, or JEDI, the military’s computing project would store and process vast amounts of classified data. The Defense Department has said it will help speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities and enable the military to advance its use of artificial intelligence.
Amazon and Microsoft became the finalists after Oracle and IBM were eliminated in an earlier round of the contract competition. Oracle         had also sued, arguing the bidding was rigged in Amazon's favor. Trump publicly waded into the bidding process over the summer, saying he heard complaints and wanted the Pentagon to take a closer look. 
“The department is confident in the JEDI award and remains focused on getting this critical capability into the hands of our warfighters as quickly and efficiently as possible,"" Smith said.
The White House didn't return an emailed request for comment Monday. 
Microsoft said in a statement it has “confidence in the qualified staff at the Department of Defense, and we believe the facts will show they ran a detailed, thorough and fair process.”
Charles Tiefer, a government contracting law professor at the University of Baltimore, said it would be “an uphill battle” for Amazon to win the lawsuit.
The company must prove real influence by the president beyond his tweets and campaign speeches. Emails and other documents would have to prove that Trump’s views toward Amazon were on the mind of officials in charge of awarding the contract. 
“That’s hard to show,"" Tiefer said. “But it’s not impossible.” 
Amazon makes the case in the lawsuit that its cloud services were a better fit for the project because of its speed, efficiency and experience securely handling classified government data. It says the Defense Department made errors in the procurement process that make little sense without taking into account Trump's antipathy toward Amazon.

“Basic justice requires reevaluation of proposals and a new award decision,"" the lawsuit says. “The stakes are high. The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends.""
Amazon Web Services has been the industry leader in moving businesses and other institutions onto its cloud — a term used to describe banks of servers in remote data centers that can be accessed from almost anywhere. But Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform has been steadily catching up, as have other providers such as Google, in both corporate and government settings.
Mike Hettinger, a tech industry lobbyist focused on federal contracting, said a strong case could have been made for either Amazon or Microsoft winning the contract but it is hard for an outside observer to know what went into the government's technical evaluations and whether Trump's comments or actions influenced the outcome. Amazon is likely to use the case to seek more internal documents from the government.
“I don’t think anybody knows what happened behind the scenes,"" Hettinger said. “I think that’s what this lawsuit is intended to find out."""
EU climate leadership in doubt as bloc set to miss 2030 goal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eu-climate-leadership-doubt-bloc-set-miss-2030-67485259,"
The European Union said Wednesday that it will likely miss its target for reducing greenhouse gases by 2030, dealing a blow to the bloc’s efforts to be a leader in the fight against climate change.
The European Environment Agency said existing measures put the EU on course to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming pollutants by 30% in the next decade compared with 1990 levels.
Currently, the 28-nation bloc is aiming for a reduction of 40% by 2030, and some leaders have called for this target to be raised to 55%, with a long-term goal of ending virtually all new emissions by 2050.
“Recent trends highlight a slowing down of progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, industrial emissions, waste generation, improving energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy,” the agency said in a report. “Looking ahead, the current rate of progress will not be enough to meet 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets.”
The report was released as officials from almost 200 countries meet in Madrid for U.N. climate talks. The EU’s new executive Commission is expected to present its long-term plan for tackling global warming — dubbed the European Green Deal — next week.
Environmental campaigners said the EU should step up its efforts to ensure that the aim of the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century remains possible.
“Current EU leaders are the last generation that can prevent the climate breakdown,” said Wendel Trio, director of the campaign group Climate Action Network Europe.
Trio noted that the European Parliament recently declared a symbolic “climate emergency.”
“Citizens want them to act now, and not in 30 years,” he said.
The European Environment Agency report said that “there is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050” if countries ratchet up their efforts, adding that this will require tackling politically sensitive issues such as fossil fuel subsidies.
A         separate study published Wednesday by a group of international scientists found that both the European Union and the United States saw emissions drop 1.7% from 2018 to 2019, but China saw a 2.6% increase and India had a 1.8% rise.
Swedish activist Greta Thunberg said the study showed that “instead of the drastic reductions desperately needed, our CO2 emissions keep increasing.”
“We’re still moving fast in the wrong direction,” Thunberg said in a tweet. Thunberg is expected to         travel to Madrid for a mass protest on Friday outside the climate talks.
Under the slogan “The world has awakened to the climate emergency,” the rally is expected to gather “at least 100,000” protesters from all over the world, including representatives of Latin America’s indigenous people at the front of it, activists said on Wednesday.
Small-scale protests of barely dozens of activists have been taking place almost daily since the summit began. On Wednesday, some 40 Extinction Rebellion activists broke into a fashion store in a major shopping thoroughfare, gluing their hands to the windows to protest the impact of the garment industry on the environment.
Police removed the protesters, who carried signs reading “The Earth pays for fast fashion” and “Green words, toxic truths.” One of them was arrested for disobeying police orders.
“2019 has been the year of the awakening of civil society and the youth who have stood up to urge politicians and business heavyweights for more ambition against the climate emergency,” said Pablo Chamorro, a spokesman for March for Climate, one of the hundreds of social justice and environmental groups signing the manifesto for Friday’s scheduled march.
The march has been hastily organized in Madrid after the U.N. climate talks moved to the Spanish capital from protest-hit Chile. Activists will also hold a march on the same day in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
NGOs and activist groups will also hold from Dec. 7 until the end of the summit, on Dec. 13, a “Social Summit” at a university in Madrid to push for greater and fairer action against global warming. The alternative summit mirrors a similar gathering in Chile where activists want to provide a platform for unofficial voices.
“Climate change has been hijacked by a technical language that seemed not to leave space for normal people to have a voice,” said Estefanía González, a Chilean activist also behind Friday’s march.
“I wish there are more people like Greta taking over the microphones and not allowing the same people to keep monopolizing the climate message,” she added.
Pope Francis, who has made caring for the environment a hallmark of his papacy, also waded into the debate by sending a message to the Madrid talks questioning if there’s the “far-sighted” political will to deal with climate change.
Climate change is a “challenge of civilization,” said Francis in the Dec. 1 message made public by The Vatican on Wednesday. He added that, “sadly,” awareness is still weak about the need to work harder for “our common home.”
In the message, Francis says that what’s needed is “clear, far-sighted and strong political will.”

US stocks rise in early trading on trade deal hopes,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-stocks-rise-early-trading-trade-deal-hopes-67686141,"NEW YORK -- 
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs Thursday on renewed optimism that the U.S. and China are close to reaching a deal in their costly trade war.
Financial, technology and health care stocks powered much of the rally, which gave the S&P 500 its second straight gain and erased its losses from earlier in the week.
Bond yields surged and real estate companies, utilities stocks and household goods makers fell as investors shifted money away from safe-play investments.
The market has been quick to react to headlines and remarks out of the Trump administration about the 16-month trade war, and Thursday was no different.
Shares jumped in the early going after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. is getting close to a “big deal” with China. Traders were also encouraged by a Wall Street Journal report saying Washington has offered to slash existing tariffs and cancel new ones set to kick in on Sunday in exchange for more agricultural purchases and intellectual property protection.
“If we do see the tariffs removed, that's saying, ‘OK, China must be agreeing to things or we must be right there,'” said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares. “That’s why the market is looking at tariffs as the bellwether to a trade deal.”
The S&P 500 climbed 26.94 points, or 0.9%, to 3,168.57. The index is up about 0.5% from its last all-time closing high on Nov. 27.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 220.75, or 0.8%, to 28,132.05. The Nasdaq gained 63.27 points, or 0.7%, to 8,717.32. The index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, is now up about 0.1% its record set on Nov. 27. 
The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks climbed 12.89 points, or 0.8%, to 1,644.81.
China’s Ministry of commerce said Thursday that its negotiators were in “close communication” with their American counterparts ahead of the new round of tariffs, but gave no indication whether the trade talks were making progress.
But late Thursday, Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, confirmed that both sides were close to inking a modest trade deal that would suspend the new tariffs and reduce existing ones by an unspecified amount. In return, China would buy more U.S. farm products, increase American companies' access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights, said Brilliant, who has been briefed by both sides.
Uncertainty over trade has been the biggest wildcard for stocks this year. The longstanding conflict has hurt manufacturing around the world and caused U.S. businesses to hold back on making investments. The saving grace for the economy has been a strong job market and consumer spending.
Speculation that the world’s two biggest economies could be close to reaching an interim “Phase 1” trade agreement spurred investors on Thursday to move money into technology, industrial and other stock sectors that tend to do well when the economy is growing.
“If we get a China trade deal, it’s probably going to catalyze another 12-plus months of growth in the U.S. and globally,” Phillips said.
Banks helped lead the gains as bond prices fell, sending yields higher. Bank of America rose 3.1%. Higher yields allow banks to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 1.90% from 1.79% late Wednesday. That’s an unusually large increase and signals more confidence in economic growth.
Technology companies also made strong gains. The sector is one of the most sensitive to swings in trade because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Cisco Systems climbed 3.1%.
Investors bid up shares in Delta Air Lines 2.9% after the most profitable U.S. carrier gave investors a surprisingly good profit and revenue forecast for 2020. The company said it expects sustained demand for air travel and stable prices for jet fuel.
Southwest Airlines gained 0.9% after it reached a deal with Boeing for compensation over the grounding of the 737 Max aircraft.
Traders hammered shares in Tailored Brands after the owner of Men's Wearhouse issued quarterly forecasts below what analysts were expecting. The stock skidded 11.1% and is down 68.4% so far this year.
While investors continue to wait for an official word on a possible U.S.-China trade deal, they’ll get a look at new economic data Friday. The Commerce Department is due to report its November snapshot of retail sales. Economists expect retail sales rose last month. The measure gives more insight into consumer spending, which has been among the brighter spots in the economy helping to push growth.
Benchmark crude oil rose 42 cents to settle at $59.18 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 48 cents to close at $64.20 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline was unchanged at $1.63 per gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 cents to $1.95 per gallon. Natural gas rose 9 cents to $2.33 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $2.70 to $1,466.70 per ounce, silver rose 11 cents to $16.85 per ounce and copper rose 1 cent to $2.79 per pound.
The dollar rose to 109.34 Japanese yen from 108.51 yen on Wednesday. The euro weakened to $1.1112 from $1.1140.
Major stock indexes in Europe closed broadly higher.

Pork industry sues over California law on animal confinement,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pork-industry-sues-california-law-animal-confinement-67555889,"
The pork industry is challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved California measure that will prohibit the sale of meat products from hogs born to sows confined in spaces that don’t meet new minimum size requirements.
A lawsuit filed late Thursday in San Diego federal court by the National Pork Producers Council and the American Farm Bureau Federation targets Proposition 12, which voters overwhelmingly passed a year ago and goes into effect in 2022. 
“Proposition 12 has thrown a giant wrench into the workings of the interstate market in pork,” the filing states. 
The measure bans the sale in California of pork and veal from farm animals raised in conditions that don't meet its standards. It also requires that all eggs sold in the state come from cage-free hens.
The rules will apply to pork products coming to California from farmers nationwide, not just from in-state farms. The industry lawsuit contends that extraterritorial reach intrudes on authority given to Congress.
”Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Proposition 12’s requirements with regard to breeding pigs violate the Commerce Clause and principles of interstate federalism embodied in the U.S. Constitution, and an injunction against the enforcement of Proposition 12’s requirements concerning pork,"" the lawsuit states.
The ballot measure, dubbed the Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act, was sponsored and financed by the Humane Society of the United States.
The lawsuit was termed “frivolous” in a statement from Jonathan Lovvorn, the Humane Society's senior vice president for animal protection litigation.
""It’s an industry out-of-step with the preponderance of consumers who find animal abuse unacceptable, yet is still trying to hold on to archaic practices — like those banned by Prop 12 — that inflict an immense amount of pain and suffering on animals,” he said.
Proposition 12's requirements include giving breeding pigs at least 24 square feet (2.2 square meters) of floor space in group pens. 
It also bars the use of individual stalls that do not meet “stand-up, turn-around” requirements, except during brief periods prior to farrowing and during weaning. 
The lawsuit states that the measure's requirements “are inconsistent with industry practices and standards, generations of producer experience, scientific research, and the standards set by other states.”
It also imposes “enormous costs” on pork producers that will ultimately increase costs for consumers, it says.
Before the election, the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst's Office said Proposition 12 would likely result in an increase in prices for eggs, pork and veal partly because farmers would have to remodel or build new housing for animals.
It could also cost the state as much as $10 million a year to enforce and millions of dollars more a year in lost tax revenues from farm businesses that choose to stop or reduce production because of higher costs, the office said.
According to 2017 U.S. Department of Agriculture data cited in the lawsuit, nearly 65,000 farms nationwide sold hogs that year with a market value of more than $26 billion. Pigs are raised nationwide, but production is concentrated in the Midwest and North Carolina.
California's pork consumption accounts for about 13% of the national market. But the state has only about 1,500 commercial breeding sows and needs the offspring of about 673,000 sows to satisfy its residents' annual demand for pork meat, the lawsuit states."
German authorities search Volkswagen offices in diesel probe,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/german-authorities-search-volkswagen-offices-diesel-probe-67467497,"
German authorities have searched Volkswagen offices as part of their investigation into the automaker’s manipulation of diesel emission tests to defeat environmental regulations.
The dpa news agency reported Tuesday that the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office confirmed it led the raids but wouldn’t comment on details due to the ongoing investigation.
Volkswagen told dpa it is cooperating fully with the prosecutors and that the searches were regarding an investigation into the EA 288 model engine.
VW said the EA 288 has already been tested and no manipulation was found.
Braunschweig prosecutors in September announced they’d charged Volkswagen's current chief executive and chairman as well as its former CEO with market manipulation in connection with the diesel emissions scandal that erupted in 2015."
Ex-Fed Chair Volcker dies,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/fed-chair-volcker-dies-tamed-inflation-recession-67603525,"
Paul Volcker, who as Federal Reserve chairman in the early 1980s elevated interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double-digit inflation, has died, according to his office.
He was 92. 
Volcker took charge of the Fed in August 1979, when the U.S. economy was in the grip of runaway inflation. Consumer prices skyrocketed 13% in 1979 and then by the same pace again in 1980.
Working relentlessly to bring prices under control, Volcker raised the Fed’s benchmark interest rate from 11% to a record 20% by late 1980 to try to slow the economy’s growth and thereby shrink inflation.
Those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily. By January 1980, a recession had begun. It lasted six months. A deeper and more painful downturn took hold in July 1981. It endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10.8% in November and December 1982, the highest level since the Great Depression. 
In a statement Monday, former President Jimmy Carter, who had chosen Volcker to be Fed chairman, called him a “giant of public service.""
“Paul was as stubborn as he was tall, and although some of his policies as Fed chairman were politically costly, they were the right thing to do,” Carter said. 
In the early 1980s, Volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway price increases. Home builders put postage stamps on bricks and on 2-by-4 wooden planks and mailed them to the Fed to protest how super-high interest rates had wrecked their businesses. 
Auto dealers, stuck with lots full of unsold cars, did the same with car keys. Angry farmers, struggling with high debts, drove their tractors to Washington and blockaded the Fed’s headquarters. 
One of the mailed 2-by-4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the Fed: David Wilcox, a young staffer under Volcker who later rose to direct the Fed's research and statistics division, said he received one of the 2-by-4s from Larry Slifman, a former senior economist in the division, and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year. Wilcox said he held onto it “as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again, creating the need for someone like Volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did.”
David Jones, an economist and author of several books on the Fed, ranks Volcker above all other chairmen since World War II. 
“Volcker was transformative in terms of Fed policy,"" Jones said. “We are still enjoying the benefits of his success.""
By sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition, Volcker implicitly asserted the Fed's independence from political and public interference. Throughout its history, the Fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. In the past three years, President Donald Trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the Fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively.
Once inflation was subdued, Volcker himself was privately pressured by President Ronald Reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted. James Baker, Treasury secretary during Reagan's second term in the late 1980s, chose supporters of lower rates to the Fed's governing board. This led to Volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986, though his opponents backed down. News reports at the time said Volcker had threatened to resign. 
“I had no doubt in my mind that Baker wanted to surround me with his appointees,” Volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the Fed. 
The pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results: Inflation receded. Once it did, Volcker’s Fed began lowering interest rates. And the economy rebounded vigorously enough for President Ronald Reagan to declare the arrival of “Morning in America’’ on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election. Volcker left the Fed in 1987, succeeded by Alan Greenspan. 
The Volcker-led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the “Great Moderation’’ — more than two decades of mostly steady economic growth, relatively low unemployment and modest price increases. The Great Moderation ended with the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
Volcker had spent most of his career in the public sector — at the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Fed board in Washington. 
A towering 6 foot 7 and perpetually rumpled, Volcker favored cheap cigars and bad suits. John Connally, a slick Texan who was Volcker’s boss at the Treasury in the early 1970s, once threatened to fire him if he didn’t get a haircut and improve his wardrobe. 
Despite his personal austerity, Volcker served in lucrative positions on Wall Street in between his stints in public service, including an early career at Chase Manhattan bank. He was chair of Wolfensohn & Co., an investment firm, from 1988 to 1996.
After leaving the Fed, Volcker took on assignments as a troubleshooter. He ran a commission to investigate what Swiss banks did with the assets of Holocaust victims during and after World War II. The United Nations assigned him to look into allegations of corruption in a UN program to provide food aid to Iraq. 
Volcker, who was born in Cape May, New Jersey, on Sept. 5, 1927. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a master's from Harvard. In 1951, he spent a year at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Foundation Fellow. 
His survivors include his second wife, Anke Dening, and two children.
After the financial crisis of 2008, President Barack Obama recruited Volcker as an economic adviser. In that role, Volcker pressed for restrictions on banks’ ability to trade in financial markets with their own money, rather than their clients’, and to invest in private equity and hedge funds. 
The regulations, known as the “Volcker Rule,’’ were included in a far-reaching financial overhaul bill Congress passed in 2010. Volcker had little sympathy for big banks in the wake of the financial crisis, which required a taxpayer bailout of big Wall Street firms. He dismissed claims that deregulated financial institutions deserved credit for coming up with innovative products and services. 
The only useful financial innovation he’d seen in years, he said, was the ATM.

"From modest beginnings, Washington now a force in wine world",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/modest-beginnings-washington-now-force-wine-world-67337319,"
When Craig and Vicki Leuthold opened the Maryhill Winery in 2001, there were about 100 wineries in the state of Washington.
That number has since exploded to more than 1,000 wineries this year, and the remarkable growth is likely to continue.
Maryhill Winery, just south of the remote town of Goldendale, is part of that growth. It has recently opened tasting rooms in Spokane and Vancouver, Washington, and is in the process of opening a tasting room in the Seattle suburb of Woodinville.
“Our timing was great,” said Craig Leuthold, whose winery produces 60 varieties. “Washington wine has really increased in popularity.”
Washington has become a force in the wine industry. The state has the nation’s second-highest number of wineries, after California. But California, which has around 3,700 wineries, remains much bigger than anyone else in the United States, selling more than $40 billion worth of wine in this country.
Within the U.S., wines from California are the top sellers, followed by wines from Australia and Italy. Washington ranks fourth in the sources of wine sold in the U.S., said Steve Warner, president of Washington State Wine, the industry’s trade group.
“More Washington wine is sold in the United States than French wine,” he said.
The state’s wine industry generates about $2.4 billion a year in revenues and contributes more than $7 billion a year to the state’s economy, Warner said.
Washington’s wines are consistently top-ranked, he said.
“Washington has a higher percentage of 90-rated wines than other top wine-producing regions in the world,” Warner said, referring to the 100-point scale for rating wines. “We are competing against wine regions with 28 generations of winemakers, who were doing it before America was a country.”
Most of the industry’s success stems from the state’s climate and soils, Warner said. Wine grapes like long sunny days and cool nights, which the vineyards in the central and eastern part of the state enjoy.
The area also gets little rainfall compared with other grape-growing regions, which is a plus, he said.
Washington still has plenty of available land at reasonable prices in wine country, said Thomas Henick-Kling, director of the enology and viticulture program at Washington State University in Pullman.
The acreage dedicated to grapes for wine is rapidly expanding. Twenty years ago, there were 24,000 acres (9,713 hectares) of grapes. Today there are 59,000 acres (23,877 hectares) of vineyards.
Washington also has skilled farmers and winemakers, graduates of winemaking programs at numerous local colleges, Henick-Kling said.
There were about 20 wineries in 1981. That grew to 100 wineries by 2001, just over 500 by 2012 and just over 1,000 now, Warner said. Growth has been averaging more than 70 new wineries per year for the past seven years.
Washington’s growth is no surprise, as the number of wineries and wine consumption continue to grow in the United States.
“The growth in wineries around the country is very exciting as wine sales continue to grow, particularly at the premium end,” said Gladys Horiuchi of the Wine Institute, which represents California wineries.
Wine shipments to the United States from all foreign and domestic sources grew 1% in 2018. The Wine Institute said people are drinking more premium wine, which starts at $8 per bottle.
The 1,000th active license was issued to Jens Hansen, owner of Uva Furem winery in Maple Valley. Hansen retired from the Air Force, moved to the Seattle area and decided to become a winemaker.
“I feel like the Washington wine community is a lot like the Air Force in that everyone looks out for each other,” Hansen said.
About 70 grape varieties are grown in Washington, with the most popular reds being cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Chardonnay and white Riesling are the most common whites.
Most of Washington’s wineries are fairly small. The owners “are passionate about wine and work full-time and crush grapes on weekends,” Warner said.
There are a smaller number of midsize wineries that enjoy national distribution, plus a handful of industry giants like Chateau Ste. Michelle, he said.
More investors from outside the state are joining the industry, Warner said. It also helps that Washington has long had a lot of wealthy people who work for companies like Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon and have money to invest in the industry, he said.
Many of the state’s best wineries are clustered around the old town of Walla Walla, which used to be known primarily for sweet onions and as home of the state penitentiary. Now it is home to world-class winemakers.
Warner expected the strong growth rate to continue.
“The line is not flattening,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we get to 2,000.”
One factor that could limit growth is climate change, but Washington also seems fortunate there.
The mighty Columbia River, which irrigates much of wine country, is predicted to be a stable water supply for many years to come, Henick-Smith said.
Heat spikes in the summer might damage grapes, he said. But farmers are moving vineyards to higher elevations looking for cooler ripening weather.
“Here in Washington we’re pretty stable,” Henick-Smith said."
Boeing chief engineer who defended Max airliner is retiring,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/boeing-chief-engineer-defended-max-airliner-retiring-67505586,"
The Boeing engineer who has played a key role in the company's response to the grounding of the 737 Max is retiring. 
Boeing said Wednesday that John Hamilton planned to retire last year as chief engineer of commercial airplanes, but he stayed on to help get the Max back into service. 
Hamilton appeared alongside CEO Dennis Muilenburg during two         congressional          hearings  in late October and explained the design and production of the Max, which has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes. 
Hamilton acknowledged Boeing made some mistakes. Those included not having tested whether a faulty sensor could trigger the plane’s anti-stall system, which investigators believe happened in both crashes, pushing down the noses of the planes. 
At other times he defended Boeing’s safety culture. While a couple lawmakers expressed frustration with Hamilton’s answers, they reserved most of their anger for Muilenburg.
Hamilton has spent 35 years at Boeing and served as chief project engineer for several planes including the 737 NG, the version that preceded the Max. He was responsible for engineering design and safety for all Boeing airliners when the company got final approval of the Max from the Federal Aviation Administration.
He was named to his current position in March to deal with the accident investigations and other technical risks, according to the company. 
He will be replaced by Lynne Hopper, vice president of engineering for Boeing's commercial airplanes business. She will be the first woman to hold the job at Boeing, a company spokesman said.
Boeing’s expectations for returning the Max to flight have been set back several times. Boeing engineers began updating flight-control software called MCAS shortly after it was determined to have played a role in the crash of a Lion Air Max off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018. They were still working on the software when an Ethiopian Airlines Max crashed near Addis Ababa in March.

"Stocks mixed as US, EU policymakers leave rates unchanged",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-mixed-fed-leaves-rates-unchanged-67677661,"TOKYO -- 
Global shares were mixed Thursday after central banks in Europe and the U.S. said they will leave interest rates unchanged for the time being.
Investors are still waiting for a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks while monitoring Britain's national election Thursday, which will likely determine if the United Kingdom pushes ahead with its departure from the 28-nation European Union. 
Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to 7,252, while France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were both flat in midday trading in Europe.
Pre-market trading on Wall Street was rudderless, with Dow and S&P futures drifting between small losses and gains. 
The European Central Bank left its key interest rate benchmarks and stimulus programs unchanged on Thursday during ts first policy meeting under newly appointed president, Christine Lagarde.
That follows a similar decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which also signaled it would leave them alone through 2020.
The Fed had been expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged this month after cutting it three times this year to shield the economy from slowing global growth and the fallout of U.S. trade conflicts.
Investor jitters over whether the U.S. and China will be able to avert a new escalation in their trade war has made for choppy trading this week, pulling major indexes lower.
Investors are hoping that both sides can avoid a new round of tariffs scheduled to kick in Sunday on Chinese goods that include phones, laptops and other popular products.
“The fact is the big event risk remains in place, with the world watching to see if the 15% tariffs kick in on $160 billion of Chinese exports on Sunday,"" Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a commentary.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% higher to finish at 23,424.81, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 6,708.80. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.5% to 2,137.35. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1.3% at 26,994.14, while the Shanghai Composite stood at 2,915.70, down 0.3%.

Signs show separate bathrooms for Uber employees and drivers at business,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/signs-show-separate-bathrooms-uber-employees-drivers-rhode/story?id=67529480,"
A viral tweet reveals an Uber business place in Rhode Island had separate bathrooms for employees and drivers, at a time when tensions between the two groups at the ride-share company are already running high.

""I’ve just always wondered why Uber viewed us as two separate classes,"" Erika Betts, who snapped the photo and shared it on Twitter, told ABC News Thursday.

""These signs are commercially made, somebody made them, somebody ordered them, somebody paid for them,"" she added.The @Uber hub in my market has designated bathrooms. Not for male/female, but for partner & employee.Anyone else think it's strange that Uber views partners & employees as two separate classes of people? pic.twitter.com/3SGeKSae3g— Erika Betts (@ErikaABetts) December 4, 2019 The @Uber hub in my market has designated bathrooms. Not for male/female, but for partner & employee.Anyone else think it's strange that Uber views partners & employees as two separate classes of people? pic.twitter.com/3SGeKSae3g
Betts, 28, said she has been an Uber driver for over two years and was at the Uber Greenlight Hub office in Providence seeking help after finding out via a notification that her account had been deactivated after she says a passenger complained about a surge fare.
""I was waiting to be seen by a representative and I was just noticing the bathroom signs on the door,"" she said. ""It’s always made me a little uncomfortable, I'm not sure what prompted me to tweet about it now.""
Even if drivers wanted to use the employee restroom, Betts says it was always locked and ""you need a key to get in there.""

Uber responded to ABC News' request for comment by pointing to a response to Bett's tweet from Andrew Macdonald, a senior vice president at the company, who said he ""looked into this.""

""This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable,"" Macdonald wrote. ""The signs are coming down today.""Hi Erika - I looked into this. This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.— Andrew Macdonald (@andrewgordonmac) December 4, 2019 Hi Erika - I looked into this. This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.
Macdonald added in a follow-up tweet that the ""bathroom was also being used for employee storage, but that's not an excuse. I don't believe this is the case anywhere else (and it's certainly not our design policy) but we're doing a full review now.""

An Uber spokesperson told ABC News Thursday that the Providence Greenlight Hub was the only location with this signage and that the signs have been taken down.
The signs still sparked outrage on social media, and even caught the eye of a lawmaker.

New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted a link to a news story of the separate bathrooms at the Providence office.Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 5, 2019 Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz
""Siri, show me what classicism looks like,"" she wrote.

In September, California passed a bill that would extend new protections to employees of so-called ""gig economy"" companies including Lyft and Uber, essentially forcing companies to recognize formerly contract workers as employees.

Uber said at the time that the California bill, which is set to go into effect in January, ""does not automatically reclassify any rideshare drivers from independent contractors to employees"" and that it will ""respond to claims of misclassification in arbitration and in court as necessary."" "

Uber releases new safety report,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/uber-reveals-6000-incidents-sexual-assaults-safety-report/story?id=67538499,"
Uber says it received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault from both riders and drivers across the United States in 2017 and 2018.

The San Francisco-based ride-hailing company voluntarily released the information, among other data, in its first-ever safety report on Thursday.

In 2017, Uber recorded 2,936 reports of sexual assault during a total of 1 billion trips throughout the United States. There were 3,045 reported sexual assaults the following year during 1.3 billion total trips.
Overall, riders accounted for 45% of the accused parties. The report noted that some assaults occurred between riders.

Among the sexual assault incidents, the company counted 464 reports of rape in 2017 and 2018. About 92% of the victims were riders and roughly 7% were drivers. Women and female-identifying individuals comprised 89% of the victims, while men and male-identifying individuals made up about 8%.
Uber said it saw a decrease of approximately 16% in the average incident rate of sexual assaults reported from 2017 to 2018. However, as its report noted, sexual assaults are often not reported, so the actual numbers could be much higher.

""I suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they’re still too common,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said of the new report via Twitter. ""Some people will appreciate how much we’ve done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right.""

During 2017 and 2018, 19 people died in physical assaults that occurred in Uber-related incidents. There were also 107 motor vehicle fatalities from Uber-related crashes in the same time frame.
""Most companies don’t talk about these hard issues, and they don’t share data about serious safety incidents. We believe it’s time for a new approach,"" Uber said in a statement announcing the report. ""Keeping this information in the dark doesn’t make anyone safer.""

The 84-page report comes as Uber faces scrutiny regarding safety concerns. Last week, London's transit authority refused to renew the company's license to operate in the British capital, citing ""a pattern of failures by the company"" that ""placed passengers and their safety at risk."" Uber said it plans to appeal the decision.

Over the past year, Uber has partnered with sexual assault prevention networks and other safety groups. Uber has also added new safety features, including more rigorous background checks, an in-app emergency button, and technology that allows the company to check in with customers if it detects a potential crash or an unexpected long stop during a trip.

"US firms keep hiring, easing worries of weakening economy",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-gains-robust-266000-jobs-unemployment-falls-35-67542986,"
American businesses have complained for years that they can’t find the workers they need to fill available jobs. November’s         robust hiring gain suggests that at least some have found a way to do so.
With the unemployment rate now at a half-century low of 3.5%, many economists have also warned that hiring would soon slow simply because there are fewer unemployed workers available.
That day may still come, but it didn’t in November. Employers added 266,000 jobs last month, the most since January. Monthly hiring has, in fact, picked up since earlier this year: It averaged 205,000 for the past three months, up from a recent low of 135,000 in July.
Friday’s jobs report largely squelched         fears of a recession that had taken hold in the summer. Steady job growth has helped reassure consumers that the economy is expanding and that their jobs and incomes remain secure. That should boost spending and growth in the months ahead.
President Donald Trump seized on the strong jobs report as he tries to focus voters' attention on the state of the economy rather than the impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats. The latest numbers also come as Trump’s trade war with China had prompted companies to cut back on their investments in plants and industrial equipment, slowing growth.
“Without the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems! #2020,” the president tweeted.
He returned to the report later Friday, tweeting: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!”
Employers seemed to be shrugging off economic concerns, adding jobs at a solid clip. And other risks to the global economy, such as a disorderly Brexit for the U.K., have faded in the past month. Given all that, the economy could provide a boost for Trump in next year’s election.
Investors cheered the report, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 340 points in afternoon trading.
The new job numbers were released as companies have been getting more creative about enticing workers as the ranks of the unemployed dwindle. Some are willing to hire people who are less qualified and train them, while others are raising pay to attract more applicants. Still others are offering flexible work schedules or have dropped         some drug-testing requirements.
These efforts have lifted the proportion of Americans with jobs and lowered the unemployment rate by much more than many economists thought possible.
“Companies have somehow achieved continued success in luring job candidates,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Some recruiters have overhauled their approach to hiring and retention as the competition for workers has tightened. Beth Thress, vice president of human resources at a Cincinnati-based company that owns two senior living centers, said it became harder to retain nursing aides and housekeepers once such retailers as Walmart and Target increased their pay.
So Thress went to the board of Maple Knoll Communities, a nonprofit that employs 675 people, and won approval to raise starting pay. She also offered more flexible schedules and set up an emergency fund for employees.
“There’s just a lot more competition, you’ve got meet their needs in some form or fashion,” she said. “It’s been a real shift in mentality.”
The changes are working so far, Thress said. The company has reduced turnover from about 40% in 2017 to just 8% so far this year.
Wages overall still aren’t growing as quickly as they have in previous expansions, but there are signs of improvement. Average hourly pay for workers, excluding managers and supervisors, which covers about 80% of the workforce, rose 3.7% in November from a year ago. That’s just a tick lower than October’s figure, which was the highest since the recession.
The higher pay is coaxing         workers off the sidelines and back into the job market. The proportion of Americans in their prime working years, aged 25 through 54, with a job was 80.3% last month, matching October’s level as the highest since January 2007.
Companies are also offering bigger raises to entice potential candidates who are working elsewhere. People who switched jobs saw their pay rise 4.3% from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the biggest gain since the recession and a full percentage point higher than the pay increase for those who stayed.
Becky Frankiewicz, president of Manpower Group North America, says her organization often tells its corporate clients to consider loosening their job listing criteria.
“We are counseling companies to look at the requirements they set for a job and ask if they are really mandatory or just nice to have,” she said.
Frankiewicz pointed to the fact that nearly 90% of the technology jobs listed at Manpower require a college degree in computer science, but less than half the people working in the field have one.
Rebecca Hamilton, co-CEO of Badger Balm, a skincare company, said the firm’s generous pay and benefits have made it easy to fill jobs, even though it is based in a small town of 700 near Keene, New Hampshire.
The 90-person company offers health and retirement benefits, but also an on-site gym, yoga classes and massages, and a free organic lunch every day.
“We don’t have any trouble whatsoever finding really good, talented people,” Hamilton said.
Still, it’s not clear how long companies will be able to keep hiring at November’s blowout pace. The fact that wages gains are accelerating suggests that companies aren’t just luring in new workers, but fighting for a smaller pool of applicants.
“It’s an indication that we are starting to reach the limits of the job market,” said Joe Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch."
EU leaders set to reject Turkey-Libya maritime border deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eu-leaders-set-reject-turkey-libya-maritime-border-67685594,"BRUSSELS -- 
European Union leaders are set to reject a maritime border agreement between Turkey and Libya as invalid and insist that the pact interferes with the rights of other countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, according to a draft summit statement.
The border deal, endorsed by the Turkish parliament last week, has fueled tensions in Ankara’s long-running dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
The three countries, which lie between Turkey and Libya, have blasted the maritime border accord as being contrary to international law. Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.
In the statement, the leaders say the Turkey-Libya agreement “infringes upon the sovereign rights of third states, does not comply with the Law of the Sea and cannot produce any legal consequences for third states.” 
The text, seen Thursday by The Associated Press and drawn up for a two-day EU summit underway in Brussels, was a draft so its exact wording could change. 
The draft document continues that the EU “unequivocally reaffirms its solidarity with Greece and Cyprus regarding these actions by Turkey.” Turkey already angered the EU by drilling for gas in waters off the divided island nation of Cyprus. 
Ankara upped the ante in that dispute on Wednesday by confirming that it would use its military forces if necessary to halt any exploratory gas drilling in waters off Cyprus that it claims to be its own.
Neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea. The NATO allies have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.
Greece insists the deal with Libya — which has no fully functioning government able to rule across all of its territory — is unenforceable and has stressed that it will protect its sovereign rights. Like its EU partners, Greece recognizes the United Nations endorsed Libyan government based in Tripoli.
The speaker of Libya’s parliament, which is affiliated with the government based in the country's east, is visiting the Greek capital. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was to meet with the speaker, Aguila Saleh, in Athens on Thursday. 
Asked whether Greece would seek to have sanctions to be imposed on Libya over its border pact with Turkey, a Greek diplomatic official said Athens was examining all options, but did not want to take any action that could harm the Libyan people. 
Greece considers the recent developments an escalation the government thinks it did not do anything to provoke, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues. 
Athens is also seeking more involvement in the international discussions over the situation in Libya, and is keeping its channels of communication with Turkey open, the official said.

France is getting ready for massive, nationwide transport strikes against government plans to overhaul the state pension system. The strike will disrupt train, buses and airline services.
In Paris, where workers’ unions are planning a march on Thursday, police warned Wednesday of possible violence and damages and ordered all businesses, cafes and restaurants along the way to close. Authorities also issued a ban on protests on the Champs-Elysees avenue, around the presidential palace, parliament and Notre Dame Cathedral.

DHS may require air travelers be photographed,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dhs-require-us-citizens-photographed-airports-67476028,"
Federal officials are considering requiring that all travelers — including American citizens — be photographed as they enter or leave the country as part of an identification system using facial-recognition technology.
The Department of Homeland Security says it expects to publish a proposed rule next July. Officials did not respond to requests for more details.
Critics are already raising objections.
Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Tuesday he will introduce legislation to block the plan and prohibit U.S. citizens from being forced to provide facial-recognition information. He said a recent data breach at Customs and Border Protection shows that Homeland Security can’t be trusted with the information.
Facial recognition is being tested by several airlines at a number of U.S. airports. American citizens are allowed to opt out of being photographed, although a 2017 audit by a federal watchdog agency found that few U.S. travelers exercised that right — barely more than one per flight.
Federal law requires Homeland Security to put into place a system to use biometrics to confirm the identity of international travelers. Government officials have made no secret of their desire to expand the use of biometrics, which they say could identify potential terrorists and prevent fraudulent use of travel documents.
Homeland Security announced the possibility of expanding biometrics to U.S. citizens in a recent, brief filing. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security, said there would be a chance for the public to comment on any change in regulations.
In a November 2018 report, Homeland Security said facial recognition is the best biometric approach at borders because it can be done quickly and “with a high degree of accuracy.” The agency said privacy risks “are mostly mitigated.” Photos used to match Americans to their identities are deleted within 12 hours, according to the report.
Jay Stanley, a policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government has told the public and Congress repeatedly that American citizens would be exempt from mandatory biometric screening.
“This new notice suggests that the government is reneging on what was already an insufficient promise,” Stanley said in a statement. ""Travelers, including U.S. citizens, should not have to submit to invasive biometric scans simply as a condition of exercising their constitutional right to travel.”"

AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misstatements at NATO summit,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-fact-check-trumps-misstatements-nato-summit-67471037,"
President Donald Trump on Tuesday wholly misrepresented the U.S. record on international trade disputes and dismissed as a mysterious “rumor” his own statement from months ago about Britain's health system.
Here's a look at some of his statements from London, where's he is attending a NATO meeting:
TRUMP: “We won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations.” — remarks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.
The U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. had won 91% of times it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the Geneva-based trade monitor. 
As Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case.
As for his claim that the U.S. “won” $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right.
Trump was referring to a WTO decision         in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion.
The WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus — a fight that began long before Trump was in office.
———
TRUMP: “We have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe.” — remarks with French President Emmanuel Macron.
MACRON: There are “very large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region.” Those from Europe are ""a tiny minority of the overall problem.""
THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. 
Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.
European nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims.
———
TRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: “I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.” — remarks with Jens Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a “rumor.”
Asked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said “when you're dealing in trade, everything’s on the table. So, NHS or anything else.""
The service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services firms can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. 
As well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharma firms more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs.
Leaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 — released by the Labour Party last week — said “patent issues” around “NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration” in talks.
It’s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be “selling off” the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill.
But it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would “want nothing to do"" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump’s words.
———
TRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: “We have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want."" — remarks with Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: That’s not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can’t do anything it wants with it.
As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. “Maybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,” McGurk         told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil.
While Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he’s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any Islamic State resurgence.
The Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to ""reinforce"" control of the oil fields and prevent them from “falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors.”

Japan economy marks 4th straight quarter of expansion,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/japan-economy-markets-4th-straight-quarter-growth-67587994,"
Japan's economy expanded at a faster than earlier estimated annual rate of 1.8% in July-September, powered by stronger consumer purchases and corporate investment ahead of an Oct. 1 tax hike. 
However that tax increase is expected to hurt growth in coming months. 
The data issued Monday were a revision of the earlier reported 0.2% growth in the last quarter. The quarterly rate of expansion was 0.4%. 
The world's third largest economy has marked four straight quarters of expansion. The better results reported by the Cabinet Office also reflect a less severe drop in exports than preliminary reports suggested. However economists are forecasting much weaker growth in the October-December quarter.
A Bank of Japan measure of consumer demand showed a 7.4% drop in October following the increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8%. That “points to a sharp fall in private consumption in the fourth quarter,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
“We are more pessimistic about the outlook for global GDP growth than most analysts and therefore think that external demand will remain weak,"" he said. “The upshot is that we expect GDP growth to shrink by 0.2% next year."" "
Families of crash passengers want wider review of Boeing Max,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/families-crash-passengers-wider-review-boeing-max-67606204,"
The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will face questions about whether the agency is too cozy with Boeing when he testifies this week before a congressional panel.
The chairman of the House Transportation Committee says he plans to ask FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson about Boeing's influence over the FAA's Seattle office and incidents in which FAA managers vetoed the concerns of the agency's own safety experts.
“We are having a hard time piercing the veil of how consistently and repeatedly Boeing is managing to pressure and overcome the objectives of the safety specialists,” committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Monday in an interview.
Dickson is scheduled to testify at a hearing Wednesday, just as the FAA gears up to review changes Boeing is making in its 737 Max jet. The Max remains grounded after two deadly crashes.
Investigations into the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia point to a flight-control system called MCAS that automatically pushed the noses of the planes down in response to faulty readings from a sensor. Boeing is making MCAS less powerful and tying it to a second sensor. It is also proposing material for training pilots about MCAS, and fixing a separate issue around flight-control computers. The company hopes airlines can resume using the Max early next year.
Relatives of passengers who died in the second crash say FAA is focusing too narrowly on Boeing's revamp of a flight-control system implicated in both accidents. They want a nose-to-tail review of every key system on the plane before the grounded planes can fly again.
“That's a tombstone mentality” to focus only on MCAS, said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter died in the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max. “You don't just wait until people die to address (other) systems.""
Chris Moore, whose daughter died in the Ethiopian crash, sent a list of questions that he hopes lawmakers will ask Dickson, including why the FAA didn't ground the Max after the first crash, when a Lion Air Max plunged into the sea off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018. 
About a dozen family members plan to attend Wednesday's hearing. They are driven by a deep distrust of Boeing, and a few have delved into the details of aircraft manufacturing. 
When Boeing's chief engineer told Congress that the company did not test what would happen if a single sensor tied to MCAS failed, family members and other critics seized on the disclosure to raise questions about Boeing's analysis of other key systems on the plane.
Boeing employees conducted those assessments under a decades-old FAA policy — strengthened in 2005 — of relying on the technical knowledge of the companies that it regulates. FAA inspectors are supposed to oversee the work of those company employees, but published reports suggest that the agency knew little about MCAS when it certified the Max.
DeFazio said Monday that the FAA program of relying on aircraft company employees “obviously needs significant improvement,” but he hasn't settled on how to do that. “I'm hoping Dickson can volunteer some ideas,"" he said.
Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines pilot and executive, will be testifying about the Max for the first time since he became FAA administrator in August.
During previous hearings, lawmakers have accused FAA of favoring Boeing and overruling FAA experts in two other cases. One involved the placement of rudder cables on the Max that, in the view of FAA engineers, could make them vulnerable to being severed if an engine blew apart in flight. 
The committee also plans to hear from several other witnesses, including Ed Pierson, a former Boeing production manager who protested a push to increase production of the Max. In an email to another Boeing executive in June 2018, which the committee made public in October, Pierson said he was hesitant to put his own family on a Boeing plane."
Woman claims her home was looted by Airbnb guests,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/georgia-woman-claims-home-looted-family-heirlooms-tvs/story?id=67384823,"
A Georgia woman said her Airbnb guests stole multiple TVs and family heirlooms after renting out her home through the popular online service.

""They took silverware that's priceless, that came from my grandfather and my mother,"" Wendolyn Warren of Jonesboro told local ABC News affiliate WSB-TV of Atlanta.
A family had booked a week-long stay at her home. When she returned, mirrors, TVs and even family heirlooms stored in a locked room were all missing, according to Warren. A total of 28 items are missing after the family's stay, she said.  
 
""I hope I can get my heirlooms back,"" Warren told the station. ""I can buy a TV, but I need my heirlooms back. I can't buy that.""

Footage from Warren's doorbell camera depicts someone trying to block the viewfinder while a second person loads items into a car.
Warren told WSB-TV that children also stayed in her home while she was gone, and the guests left behind homework and toys.
Sgt. Cherie West of the Clayton County Police Department confirmed to ABC News that a theft or burglary had occurred and an investigation is underway.
“We are appalled by the reported behavior and are quickly working with the host to initiate a claim through our $1 Million Host Guarantee. We’ve removed the booking guest from our community and stand ready to support Clayton County police in their investigation,"" Airbnb told ABC News in a statement. ""With nearly two million guests checking in to Airbnb listings every night, negative incidents are incredibly rare.""

Airbnb's website states that all guests are required to ""provide their full name, date of birth, phone number, email address, and payment information to Airbnb before booking. Home hosts also have the option to require guests to provide Airbnb with a government ID before booking their listing.""

""We offer things like rebooking assistance, refunds, reimbursements, our $1 million Host Guarantee, and insurance programs for home and experience hosts to help make things right,"" the site adds.

Trump administration tightens food stamp work requirements,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-administration-tightens-food-stamp-work-requirements-67494630,"
The Trump administration is tightening work requirements for the federal food stamp program in a move that will slash benefits for hundreds of thousands of people.
The final rule, announced Wednesday, will limit the ability of states to exempt work-eligible adults from having to obtain steady employment in order to receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps feed more than 36 million Americans.
Scaling back public benefits for low-income Americans has long been a Trump administration priority. The rule announced Wednesday is one of three proposals for cutting the food stamp program.
Brandon Lipps, deputy under secretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Nutrition and Consumer Services, said tightening the work requirement would save roughly $5.5 billion over five years. It would also cut benefits for roughly 688,000 SNAP recipients.
Secretary Sonny Perdue said the rule will help move people “from welfare to work.”
“We want to encourage people by giving them a helping hand, but not an infinitely giving hand,” he said.
Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, called the rule “an unacceptable escalation of the administration’s war on working families.”
“The President has cynically weaponized USDA as a blunt political instrument, in clear opposition to its mission to ‘do right and feed everyone,’” said Fudge, who chairs the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations.
Under current rules, work-eligible able-bodied adults without dependents and between the ages of 18 and 49 can currently receive only three months of SNAP benefits in a three-year period if they don’t meet the 20-hour work requirement. But states with high unemployment rates or a demonstrable lack of sufficient jobs can waive those time limits.
The new rule imposes stricter criteria that states must meet in order to issue waivers.
The new plan will strip states’ ability to issue waivers unless a city or county has an unemployment rate of 6% or higher. The waivers will be good for one year and will require the governor to support the request.
The final rule will be published in the federal register Thursday, and go into effect in April.
Over the past year         USDA has proposed changes to other areas of the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.  USDA also has proposed eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility for food stamps, a measure that allows recipients of certain non-cash public benefits to automatically qualify for food stamps. And in October, the administration proposed changing how utility costs are factored into benefit calculations.
Lipps said the USDA is currently reviewing comments received during public comment period for the other two proposal, but did not say when the department will finalize them.
The Urban Institute in a study released last month estimated that taken together, the three measures would affect roughly 2.2 million households, and 3.7 million individual beneficiaries.
President Donald Trump supported House Republicans in their efforts to include stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients in last year’s farm bill. Those provisions were ultimately stripped from the final bill."
US trade gap narrows 7.6% to $47.2 billion in October,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-trade-gap-narrows-76-472-billion-october-67517212,"
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in October as imports fell faster than exports. The politically sensitive trade gap with China dropped.
The Commerce Department said Thursday that the gap between what America sells and what it buys abroad dropped 7.6% to $47.2 billion in October. Imports tumbled 1.7% to $254.3 billion on reduced purchases of foreign oil, cars and auto parts and pharmaceuticals. Exports dipped 0.2% to $207.1 billion on a drop in sales of soybeans and aircraft engines.
The deficit in the trade of goods with China narrowed by 1.1% to $$31.3 billion in October and is down 14.6% so far this year. The goods deficit with Mexico dropped 1.4% to $8.8 billion but is up 28% so far in 2019.
President Donald Trump, declaring persistent trade deficits a sign of U.S. economic weakness, has slapped taxes on imported steel and aluminum and hundreds of Chinese goods and has sought to replace a North American free trade pact that he says puts U.S. factories at a disadvantage to low-wage plants in Mexico. Congress has yet to ratify the revamped version he negotiated last year with Mexico and Canada.
The trade gap is still 1.3% wider so far this year than it was in January-October 2018, despite dropping in September and October. 
Mainstream economists say the trade deficit reflects an economic reality that doesn’t yield much to changes in government policy: Americans consume more than they produce, and imports fill the gap.
A strong dollar is another consistent obstacle to more balanced trade. The American currency is widely used in international business transactions and is therefore in high demand, propping up its value and putting American exports at a price disadvantage in world markets.
In October, the United States ran a $68 billion deficit in the trade of goods such as autos and appliances. But it ran a $20.8 billion surplus in services, including education and banking."
Leaders scramble for final votes as UK's ugly election ends,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/leaders-scramble-final-votes-uks-ugly-election-ends-67662071,"LONDON -- 
Britain’s election has been like the country’s late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest         Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by         Jeremy Corbyn  ahead of Thursday's election. But         all the parties are nervous about the verdict of a volatile electorate fed up after years of Brexit wrangling.
Truck driver Clive Jordan expressed a weariness that could be heard up and down the country during the five-week campaign.
“Basically I just want it over and done with now,” he said. “Nobody’s doing what they said. Everybody’s lying.” 
Britain's first December vote since 1923 has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It is being held more than two years early in hopes of breaking Britain’s political deadlock over the country’s stalled departure from the European Union.
Johnson has focused relentlessly on Brexit throughout the campaign, endlessly repeating his slogan “Get Brexit done.” He says that if he wins a majority of the         650 House of Commons seats on Thursday, he will get Parliament to ratify his “oven-ready” divorce deal with the EU and take Britain out of the bloc as scheduled on Jan. 31.
“If we can get a working majority, we have a deal, it's ready to go,” Johnson said Wednesday as he watched pies being baked at a catering firm in central England. ""We put it in, slam it in the oven, take it out and there it is -- get Brexit done.""
As a slogan, “Get Brexit done” is both misleading and effective. If Britain leaves the EU on Jan. 31 it will only kick-start months or years of negotiations on future trade relations with the bloc, involving tough trade-offs between independence and access.
“His campaign was all about ‘Getting Brexit done,’ but actually it’s about getting Brexit started,” said Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics. “Elections seem to suggest these things are easy; they’re not.”
But the notion of an end to the Brexit melodrama is tempting to voters who have watched politicians bicker for more than three years since Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union.
“Brexit is fueling the election,” said Allan Bailey, a parish councilor in Clowne, a former coal-mining village in the central England constituency of Bolsover. “If one person can offer this area ... Brexit, that person will win.”
The Conservatives have focused much of their energy on trying to win seats like Bolsover — working-class towns in central and northern England that have elected Labour lawmakers for decades, but also voted strongly in 2016 to leave the EU.
Polls suggest that plan may be working, and the Conservatives have also been helped by the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage, which decided at the last minute not to contest 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
Labour — which is largely but ambiguously pro-EU — faces competition for anti-Brexit voters from the centrist Liberal Democrats, Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties and the Greens.
“The only reason the Conservatives are so far ahead in the polls now is that the ‘remain’ vote is divided,” said Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at King’s College London. “For ‘remain’ voters it has been a real failure of leadership.”
If the Tories fail to win a majority, it will be a sign that voters think other issues are just as important as Brexit. Labour has focused on domestic issues, especially the wear and tear to the country’s state-funded health service after nine years of Conservative government austerity. Labour also promises to boost public spending, nationalize Britain’s railways and utilities and provide everyone in the country with free internet access — all paid for by raising taxes on high earners.
“My message to all those voters who are still undecided is that you can vote for hope in this election,” Corbyn said Wednesday at his final campaign rally.
On Brexit, Labour says it will negotiate a new divorce deal with the EU, then offer voters the choice in a new referendum between leaving on those terms and remaining in the bloc.
For many voters, Thursday's election offers an unpalatable choice. Both Johnson and Corbyn have personal approval ratings in negative territory, and both have been dogged by questions about their character.
Johnson has been confronted with past broken promises, untruths and offensive statements, from calling the children of single mothers “ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate” to comparing Muslim women who wear face-covering veils to ""letter boxes.""
Corbyn has been accused of allowing anti-Semitism to spread within the party. The 70-year-old left-winger is portrayed by opponents as an aging Marxist with unsavory past associations with Hamas and the IRA. 
Though the candidates claim to carry positive messages, the campaign has been littered with allegations of mudslinging and dishonesty — largely by the Conservatives. The Tories doctored a video of an interview with a senior Labour lawmaker to make it appear as if he had failed to answer a question, when he had. The party re-branded its press office Twitter account “FactCheckUK” during a television debate, earning a warning but no sanction from the social media site.
Johnson combined an aggressive online campaign with a cautious approach to live appearances. He largely avoided tough interviews — to the fury of opponents — and had a generally gaffe-free election until the final days of the campaign. 
On Monday, Johnson was caught making a ham-fisted and seemingly unsympathetic reaction to a picture of a 4-year-old boy lying on a hospital floor because no beds were available. Asked to look at the picture on a reporter’s phone, Johnson grabbed the device and pocketed it.
On Tuesday, the father of a man killed in last month’s knife attack near London Bridge accused the prime minister of using his son’s death for political gain.
It's unclear how much those moments will influence the outcome when Britain’s voters pass their verdict on Thursday. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (0700GMT to 2200GMT), with most results expected early Friday.

Experts split sharply over experimental Alzheimer’s drug,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/details-emerge-drug-slow-alzheimers-disease-67522773,"
A company that claims to have the first drug to slow mental decline from Alzheimer's disease made its case to scientists Thursday but left them sharply divided over whether there’s enough evidence of effectiveness for the medicine to warrant federal approval.
Excitement and skepticism have surrounded aducanumab since its developers stopped two studies earlier this year because it didn't seem to be working, then did a stunning about-face in October and said new results suggest it was effective at a high dose.
During Thursday's presentation at an Alzheimer's         conference in San Diego, the developers convinced some experts that the drug deserves serious consideration. But others were dubious.
Changes made during the study and unusual analyses of the data made the results hard to interpret. And the newly released results showed the drug made only a very small difference in thinking skills in one study and none in the other.
Alzheimer’s patients and families are desperate for any help, no matter how small, adding pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve something.
But with conflicting results, ""I don't see how you can conclude anything other than that another trial needs to be done,"" said the Mayo Clinic's Dr. David Knopman, who was involved in one of the studies.
Laurie Ryan, a dementia scientist at the National Institute on Aging, agreed: “We need more evidence.”
Other doctors who consult for the drug’s developers cheered the results. Dr. Paul Aisen, a dementia specialist at the University of Southern California, said they were ""consistent and positive"" in showing a benefit at a high dose — ""a truly major advance.""
Aducanumab aims to help the body clear harmful plaques, or protein clumps, from the brain. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen is developing it with Japan’s Eisai Co.
In afternoon trading, the companies’ stocks were up roughly 4%.
The stakes are high for approval or denial.
More than 5 million people in the U.S. and millions more worldwide have Alzheimer's. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and do not slow the loss of memory and thinking skills.
But approving a drug that isn't truly effective could expose patients to financial and medical risks and give other drugmakers less incentive to develop better treatments.
The makers of aducanumab undertook two studies, each enrolling about 1,650 people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia from Alzheimer's.
Those with a gene that raises their risk of the disease were started on a lower dose because they are more likely to suffer inflammation in the brain from medicines that target plaque.
But as the studies went on and concern about this side effect eased, the rules were changed to let such patients get a higher dose.
A Biogen vice president, Samantha Budd Haeberlein, said more people got the higher dose in one study, and that helps explain why it succeeded and the other one failed.
But the new analyses were done on partial results, and with methods not agreed upon at the outset, which makes any conclusions unreliable, independent experts said.
Also, the drug’s benefits may have looked more impressive than they really were because patients in the placebo group worsened more in the positive study than in the one that failed.
""It's hard to know exactly what happened here,"" said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation. ""I don't see how the FDA could approve it.""
Questions also arose about the size of any benefit.
The drug did not reverse decline, only slowed the rate of it compared to the placebo group by 22% in one study. Yet that meant a difference of only 0.39 on an 18-point score of thinking skills.
""It's a very small amount,"" Fillit said.
Still, Maria Carrillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Association, said it was “the largest reduction that we've seen to date,"" adding: ""It may mean that they remember their loved ones a little longer.""
The drug ""is worthy of significant, rigorous exploration"" and review by the FDA, she said. ""This is an important moment for the Alzheimer's community.""
Some doctors and patients who helped test the drug are convinced it helped.
One was Charles Flagg, 78, a retired minister from Jamestown, Rhode Island, who received aducanumab until the studies were halted in March. Since he was taken off the medicine, “his cognition, his alertness, his interactions have definitely diminished,"" said his wife, Cynthia Flagg.
Biogen stressed the need for an effective treatment and suggested that delaying access to a drug that may work could deprive many people of help while further study is done.
Dr. John Ioannidis, a Stanford University expert on research methods, said patients’ need should not drive the FDA’s decision.
""If we go down that path, we're likely to introduce a lot of ineffective treatments for diseases that are really common,"" he said. ""It would be a complete mess.""

Retired UAW vice president is the latest to plead guilty,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/retired-uaw-vice-president-latest-plead-guilty-67501147,"
A retired vice president at the United Auto Workers pleaded guilty Wednesday to corruption charges, admitting he received a $250,000 kickback after arranging a contract for 58,000 watches.
Joe Ashton led the union's General Motors department until July 2014 and also had a seat on the automaker's board.
Ten people with ties to the UAW have been charged in the corruption investigation; eight have pleaded guilty, including the widow of a union vice president. Separately, three people who worked at Fiat Chrysler have been convicted.
Ashton, 71, of Ocean View, New Jersey, appeared in Detroit federal court. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and faces roughly three years in prison when he's sentenced on March 3.
Ashton declined to comment. He awarded a $3.9 million contract from the UAW-GM training center for thousands of watches that remain in storage. The government said they were never given to union members.
“He has asked me to apologize to all the members of the UAW. Good people make really bad decisions. ... He fully accepts responsibility,"" defense attorney Jerry Ballarotto told reporters.
Ballarotto said he'll offer an explanation — “not an excuse"" — at sentencing.
In a statement, the UAW said Ashton's crimes are “against everything we stand for.""
While negotiating new contracts with GM, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler, the UAW has been in a crisis for months because of the corruption investigation. Gary Jones, whose house was raided by federal agents in August,         recently quit as president. He hasn't been charged.

Trial begins over Elon Musk's 'pedo guy' tweet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/elon-musks-pedo-guy-tweet-defamation-trial-begins/story?id=67458299,"
The trial over a since-deleted tweet from entrepreneur Elon Musk calling a British diver a ""pedo guy"" began in a California courtroom Tuesday.

Musk took the stand Tuesday afternoon, calling Twitter a ""free-for-all"" and saying, ""There's everything on Twitter.""

The legal saga over the social media post began in September 2018 when the Tesla CEO was sued by diver Vernon Unsworth for defamation.

The suit was the culmination of a public spat between Musk and Unsworth that began earlier that summer when seemingly the whole world tuned in to the rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach who were trapped in a cave in northern Thailand for 18 days in June and July.
Unsworth was a diver on the ground in Thailand attempting to aid the Thai Navy and first responders with his diving expertise. Musk, meanwhile, built a submarine with a team of engineers and sent it to the Thai Navy to aid in the rescue efforts.

The diver called the submarine a ""PR stunt"" in an interview with CNN, saying that Musk ""can stick his submarine where it hurts.""

Musk then lashed out at Unsworth and wrote in the tweet at the center of the lawsuit: ""We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.""

He admitted in court Tuesday he had never heard of Unsworth until seeing him in the CNN interview and did not know about his involvement in the cave rescue beforehand. Musk called Unsworth's claims an unprovoked attack on a good-natured act.
In the original complaint filed in 2018, attorneys for Unsworth argue that the word ""pedo"" ""is a well-recognized shorthand phrase for the term pedophile.""

""As one of the highest-profile and wealthiest individuals in the world, Musk knew that this accusations against Mr. Unsworth would be conveyed to a worldwide audience and would result in the accusations receiving massive publicity,"" the court documents state.

Under questioning in court, Musk said Tuesday that some people found him influential -- and others do not.

Moreover, lawyers for Unsworth argue that Musk doubled down on the accusation -- emailing a BuzzFeed News reporter and claiming Unsworth has a ""child bride,"" among other allegations, according to Unsworth’s lawyers.

Musk concluded the note to the reporter with: ""I f------ hope he sues me,"" according to the complaint.
Musk defended his tirade in a court declaration filed in September 2019, saying he had watched the CNN interview Unsworth gave and that his tweets were ""responding to Mr. Unsworth’s false claims and attack on the effort and character of my team and me.""

""By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia,"" the court filing said. ""'Pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person’s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of acts of pedophilia.""
Musk added that his email to the BuzzFeed News reporter was labeled ""off the record,"" and he did not expect them to publish its contents without verifying it themselves.

Unsworth is seeking more than $75,000 in damages, attorney fees, and a court order stopping Musk from making further allegations.

Attorneys for Unsworth and Musk did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on Tuesday.

Ultimately, the 12 boys and their coach stuck in the cave were rescued by a team of international divers. Musk's submarine was not used.

GM lending $40M to startup company buying closed Ohio plant,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gm-lending-40m-startup-company-buying-closed-ohio-67607251,"
General Motors has agreed to loan $40 million to a newly formed company that wants to make electric pickup trucks at a massive Ohio assembly plant GM shut down earlier this year.
The agreement between the two companies also would allow GM to buy back the plant up until next May, documents filed last week show. The amount available would be more than enough to cover the $20 million price tag for the plant.
Lordstown Motors Corp. announced a month ago that it had bought the the         once-bustling factory near Youngstown that made the Chevrolet Cruz up until last March.
The new company wants to begin making electric trucks by late 2020, but it also said that it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM's decision to end production in Lordstown, where it employed 4,500 two years ago, came into the political spotlight after President Donald Trump criticized the plan last year and pushed GM executives to either reopen or sell the plant, At one point, he threatened to cut off all federal subsidies to the automaker.
GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company wants to help Lordstown Motors stick to its launch schedule and that the company does not expect it would buy the plant back, nor is it an investor in Lordstown Motors. 
“It's in everyone's best interest in seeing this succeed,"" he said. 
The loan agreement, first reported by the         The Business Journal in Youngstown, also would give GM the chance to lease land next to the Lordstown plant. 
GM announced last week that it has formed a joint venture with Korea's LG Chem to build an electric vehicle battery cell factory at undisclosed location near Lordstown. 
The new battery plant will create more than 1,100 jobs, but the exact location hasn't been disclosed.
Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, plans to hire 400 production workers next year so that it can begin limited production of its electric trucks.

Elon Musk explains that Cybertruck window fail,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/elon-musk-explains-cybertrucks-armor-glass-windows-shattered/story?id=67316874,"
Elon Musk explained what went wrong and what he would do differently ""next time"" after the, supposedly, indestructible windows of Tesla's new Cybertruck shattered during its debut.

While rumors swirled online that it could be a publicity stunt, but Musk confirmed that a fatal combination of a sledgehammer impact followed by a steel ball hurl can in fact cause even ""armor glass"" windows to break.

Responding to a Twitter user, Musk wrote that the windows smashed because the ""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off.""

He continued: ""Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …""
Musk debuted the company's first all-electric pickup truck at a grand press event at the Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California, on Nov. 21, boasting the truck's ""armor glass"" exterior that was supposedly unbreakable and even bulletproof to small arms fire.
The CEO then slammed one of the windows with a sledgehammer and didn't even make a dent.

But then, things took a turn when Musk invited Tesla's chief designer Franz von Holzhausen on stage, asking him, ""Could you try to break this glass please?""

Von Holzhausen hurled the steel ball at the window and it shattered. He tried again with the rear window and the same thing happened.

“Oh my f------ God,” Musk exclaimed onstage. “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”
Despite the broken windows, demand for the Cybertruck so far has shattered some expectations.

Musk tweeted Sunday night that the vehicle already has 200,000 preorders, even though it won't hit the road until late 2021.

"YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist and similar insults",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/youtube-cracks-racist-sexist-similar-insults-67652736,"SAN FRANCISCO -- 
YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site. 
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other “protected attributes.” The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload. 
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on — and bans from — the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.
YouTube has been reviewing its policies and guidelines for about two years, Matt Halprin, the company's vice president of trust and safety, said in an interview. He said the company tries to find a balance between allowing freedom of expression and keeping hateful speech to a minimum . 
YouTube has long prohibited outright threats of violence. In June, it updated its hate speech policies to ban videos with white supremacist and Neo-Nazi viewpoints.
But the company also received significant pushback that month after it allowed a video to remain on the site from conservative commentator Steven Crowder. In the video, Crowder used homophobic slurs aimed at Vox reporter Carlos Maza.
Maza publicly criticized YouTube for its decision — but the company said it didn't violate any anti-harassment policies.
That will change today. YouTube confirmed that Crowder's videos about Maza now violate its new policies and will be removed.
YouTube also announced it would take action against channels that have been found to repeatedly harass people in videos. In many cases, it will “demonetize” the channel, YouTube said,  by turning off any ad revenue those videos would normally generate  for their  creators.
YouTube already demonetized Crowder's channel.
The new anti-harassment and violence policies also apply to public officials, though videos will still remain on the site if they are parts of news stories, documentaries or other educational material. 
YouTube is also rolling out a comment review tool to video owners that will, by default, hold back comments the company's algorithms have flagged as potentially inappropriate until creators have reviewed them. Video creators can turn off that setting if they want."
"Expedia replaces CEO, CFO after fight over reorganization",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/expedia-replaces-ceo-cfo-fight-reorganization-67494629,"
Expedia says its CEO and chief financial officer have quit after clashing with the board over strategy, and Chairman Barry Diller will help run the travel company while it searches for permanent replacements.
The company said Wednesday that the resignations of CEO Mark Okerstrom and CFO Alan Pickerill took effect immediately.
Diller said a reorganization plan pushed by the departing executives was sound in concept but led to a loss of focus, disappointing earnings and a “lackluster” short-term outlook. He said the board believes the company can grow faster in 2020.
Diller and Vice Chairman Peter Kern will manage day-to-day operations, and Chief Strategy Officer Eric Hart will be acting CFO.
Okerstrom joined Expedia in 2006, rose to CFO in 2011 and was named CEO in August 2017, when Dara Khosrowshahi left to become the CEO of Uber.
Expedia said the board also authorized the buyback of up to 20 million more shares on top of 9 million shares that can be repurchased under a previous decision. 
Shares of Expedia Group Inc. rose $6.23, or 6.3%, to $105.62 in midday trading. At the close of trading Tuesday, the shares had lost 12% this year, and were pummeled after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results last month.
The Bellevue, Washington-based company runs travel sites including Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Travelocity. "
Google co-founders step aside as antitrust scrutiny heats up,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/google-founders-step-scrutiny-heats-67482303,"
Google’s co-founders are relinquishing their executive positions just as state and federal regulators, not to mention the Department of Justice and Congress, are taking a keen interest in possible abuse of its privacy practices and market power.
But their long foreshadowed successor, Sundar Pichai, has been well prepped to serve as the public face of the company in addition to his current role as chief executive.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping down as CEO and president, respectively, of Google parent company Alphabet. The move caps more than two decades during which the pair have shepherded the one-time startup they founded in a Silicon Valley garage.
Pichai, who has been Google’s CEO since 2015, will now also head up Alphabet. The company isn’t filling Brin’s position as president.
Google is facing increasing criticism and investigations from authorities in the U.S. and Europe about its privacy policies and nature of its many-legged business. That will now fall to Pichai to wrangle and push through — though Brin and Page, both 46, have noticeably backed out of the spotlight already.
Both stopped making appearances earlier this year at the regular question-and-answer sessions with employees, and Page didn't attend this summer's Alphabet shareholders meeting even though he was still in the CEO role.
Last year, Google raised hackles in Congress by refusing to send Page or Pichai to a hearing on Russian manipulation of internet services to sway U.S. elections. Congressional officials left an empty chair for Page at the witness table; top executives from Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile, turned up to testify. Offended lawmakers derided Google as “arrogant.”
Although longtime tech analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said he doesn’t believe Brin and Page are leaving “because the fire is getting hotter,” he said Pichai's role at Google has been preparing him for the increased government scrutiny.
Pichai         testified before Congress last December for the first time, defending the company against claims from Republicans that the search service is biased against conservatives.
Alphabet has been positioning Pichai as the de facto leader for quite some time. It has also made him the top executive voice at shareholders meetings and on earnings call. Recently, Pichai changed the format of the employee question-and-answer sessions from a weekly occurrence to a monthly one.
Pichai, a 47-year-old immigrant from India, has worked at the company for 15 years, serving as a leader in projects to build Google’s Chrome browser and overseeing Android. Pichai, who has an engineering background, took over as the head of Google's products before being promoted to CEO when Alphabet was created. He is known as a soft-spoken and respected manager.
Google has been facing pressure from privacy advocates over its collection and use of personal information to target advertising. It also faces allegations that it abuses its dominance in search and online advertising to push out rivals.
The company is the subject of antitrust inquiries from Congress, the Department of Justice, a group of U.S. state attorneys general and European authorities. The company has also faced harsh criticism about the material on its services. Its video streaming business, YouTube, was fined $170 million to settle allegations it improperly collected personal data on children without their parents' consent.
In its early days, Google focused on only one business — cataloging the growing internet. Page and Brin started Google soon after they met as Stanford University graduate students in 1995.
The company has now become         one of the most influential companies in the world. Google dominates online search and digital advertising and makes the world’s most widely used operating system for smartphones, Android. It's hard to make it through a whole day without using one of Google's services — ranging from online tools to email, cloud computing systems, phones and smart speaker hardware.
Bajarin doesn't expect much to change with the executive shuffle. And if anything does, he said, it will be due to government regulation.
Pichai assured employees in an internal email that his new job wouldn't mean he was taking a step back from Google.
""I want to be clear that this transition won't affect the Alphabet structure or the work we do day to day,"" he wrote. ""I will continue to be very focused on Google and the deep work we’re doing to push the boundaries of computing and build a more helpful Google for everyone.""
Alphabet — an umbrella corporation that the two created in 2015 — still boasts Google as its central fixture and key moneymaker. But it's also made up of what are known as ""other bets,"" or longshot projects. That includes drone company Wing and self-driving car firm Waymo.
Page and Brin, in announcing the news Tuesday, said the company has ""evolved and matured"" in the two decades since its founding. Both promised to stay active as board members and shareholders.
""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,""         they wrote in a blog post.
Brin and Page still hold a majority of voting shares of Alphabet. According to a regulatory filing in April, Page holds 26.1% of the Google shareholder vote, while Brin holds 25.2% - both thanks to so-called “super voting” shares.
According to Forbes magazine, Page has a net worth of $52.4 billion and Brin $56.8 billion.
""Keep in mind, they are not losing their title as billionaires, but they are changing their roles,"" Bajarin said.
Google's longest serving CEO is still Eric Schmidt, the former executive brought into the role in 2001 as a so-called ""adult supervisor"" for Brin and Page. Schmidt stepped into the position as the company's board worried about the relative inexperience of Brin and Page to manage the growing company. He remained CEO until 2011, when         Page once again became chief executive. Schmidt stayed on the board until this year.
Page grew up in Michigan, where his late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos.

Amazon blames Trump's 'personal vendetta' for losing $10B contract,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-lost-10b-pentagon-contract-trumps-personal-vendetta/story?id=67606505,"
Amazon places the blame directly on President Donald Trump for why it was passed over for a $10 billion Pentagon contract, arguing in newly unsealed court documents that Trump used his power to influence the decision as part of his ""personal vendetta"" against the company and its CEO Jeff Bezos.

Trump ""used his power to 'screw Amazon' out of the JEDI Contract as part of his highly public personal vendetta against Mr. Bezos, Amazon and the Washington Post,"" lawyers for Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud-computing offshoot of the online retail giant, argued in a complaint with the Court of Federal Claims.
Trump frequently criticizes the company and Bezos on Twitter, accusing Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes and the Bezos-owned Washington Post of covering his administration unfairly.

The lucrative Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract to build cloud computing systems for the Department of Defense has a ""ceiling value of $10,000,000,000,"" and was awarded to Microsoft in October, the Pentagon announced.
Prior to the announcement, AWS was thought by many to be the top choice for the deal. AWS is one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the nation and currently works with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

After being passed off for Microsoft, AWS protested this decision in the Court of Federal Claims, arguing in the filing unsealed Monday that the company was not selected due to ""improper pressure"" from the president.

Trump ""launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks"" to steer the contract away from AWS to and to harm Bezos, ""his perceived political enemy,"" the court documents allege.
Department of Defense spokeswoman Elissa Smith declined to comment on specific claims in the litigation, but said the decision-making process was free of ""external influences.""

""This source selection decision was made by an expert team of career public servants and military officers from across the Department of Defense and in accordance with DOD's normal source-selection process,"" Smith said in a statement to ABC News.

""There were no external influences on the source selection decision,"" Smith added. ""The department is confident in the JEDI award and remains focused on getting this critical capability into the hands of our warfighters as quickly and efficiently as possible.""

Defense Secretary Mark Esper also defended the Pentagon's decision in a news conference last month, saying that the awarding of the contract was ""conducted fairly.""

""I’m confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,"" he told reporters. ""I will leave it at that."" 

Trump had suggested in July that he could intervene in the decision-making process for the contract, saying from the Oval Office, “I'm getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon"" and ""Great companies that are complaining about it, so we’re going to take a look at it. We'll take a strong look at it.”

His comments led Republican lawmakers in the House Armed Services Committee to send a letter in July warning Trump against intervening.

Flooded farmers face growing dilemma in warming world,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/flooded-farmers-face-growing-dilemma-warming-world-67662003,"CRESCENT, Iowa -- 
Frogs, carp and bugs thrived all summer in murky floodwaters where Gene Walter should have planted corn and soybeans. Last year’s ruined crop spilled from metal storage bins that burst nine months ago when the Missouri River surged through two levees near his southwest Iowa farm.
Like many in the water-weary Midwest, Walter doesn’t know if climate change was responsible for the second major flood in nine years. Or the increasingly frequent torrential rains that dump more water in an hour than he used to see in days.
Even so, “we kind of feel like it’s the new normal,” said Walter, who lost 46,000 bushels of corn and soybeans. “You can’t rely on anything. You can’t build anything. You can’t do future planning ... the uncertainty is the thing that is really bad.”
This year’s devastating losses are forcing tough decisions about the future of farming in America’s flood plains, even among those skeptical of climate change and humans’ role in it.
Farmers who lost billions of dollars in grain, livestock, equipment, structures and unplanted crops are wondering whether they should — or can — return to the fertile bottomlands next year.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must determine how many damaged levees can be rebuilt but says it won’t be all of them. More than 50 levees were breached on the Missouri River alone, taking thousands of acres out of production.
And with the ground still soggy heading into winter, experts say the stage is set for more flooding next spring.
“A lot of this ground won’t be put back into production,” said Brett Adams, a Peru, Nebraska, farmer who saw 2,000 acres (809 hectares) — 80% of his land — submerged in up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) of water. “I’ve seen it first-hand up and down the river — land is so tore up from flooding that some of it is completely ruined.”
Adams lost over 100,000 bushels of corn and a half million dollars in potential income after six storage bins burst. But he bristles when people ask why he farms in an area that could flood.
“Because it never flooded before,” Adams tells them, noting that a levee built in 1950 kept his farm dry during major floods in 1993 and 2011.
It’s very difficult to directly tie this year’s flooding — or any single weather event — to climate change. But the flooding comes as “we’re seeing big rain and even bigger snows that are consistent with what we will see in a warming world,” because a warmer atmosphere delivers more water to storm systems, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt.
The number of heavy rain events has increased throughout much of the U.S., including the Midwest, where the days with at least one inch of rain averaged 13% higher from 2009 to 2018 than the long-term average dating to 1950, according to NOAA. 
In Missouri, the number of annual 4-inch (10.2-centimeter) or greater rainfalls was 58% higher than the long-term average. In Iowa, the increase was 31% and in Nebraska it was 23%.
There also will be more severe droughts, experts say, while rains will be more intense, with more water falling in a shorter period. What's more, the greatest increase in rainfall is occurring in the fall, when farmers are trying to harvest.
The unpredictability “ends up being really bad news for farms,” said Jeffrey S. Dukes, an ecologist who directs the Climate Change Research Center at Purdue University.
———
Heavy rains and flooding kept farmers from their fields in more than a dozen states this year, the wettest on record through October in the contiguous U.S., and breached levees along major waterways that included the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers.
On the Missouri, the         disaster unfolded after a blizzard was followed by heavy rain that fell on the snow and frozen ground. Most of the runoff came from tributaries without levees or dams, so the Army Corps had no way to slow the surge and little time to warn farmers.
“It just completely overwhelmed the levees downstream,” said Matthew Krajewski, chief of the readiness branch in the Corps’ Omaha District.
Experts say heavy rain in 2018 set the stage for the floods because the soil was saturated as winter started.
Now         the situation is worse than this time last year because heavy rain fell all summer and into the fall, preventing the soil from drying out, said Kevin Low, a hydrologist at the Missouri Basin River Forecast Center.
“The setup is extremely bad,” he said, noting most levees have not been repaired. “There is nothing we can do but watch and wait.”
Some areas along the Missouri were above flood stage more than 270 consecutive days, according to hydrologist David Pearson at the National Weather Service’s Missouri Basin River Forecast Center.
Julius Schaaf believes it’s the Army Corps’ job to protect farmland like his, though he concedes there is a legitimate question whether farmers should remove structures from flood plains.
“The levees and dams ... kind of gave us a false sense of security,” said Schaaf, whose farms near Randolph, Iowa were flooded this year. “We went ahead and made an investment because the government said, ‘We’ve got this river tamed and you folks are good.’”
But the Corps says its priority is to protect people and infrastructure such as highways, railroads and towns — not agricultural land.
The agency is conducting cost-benefit assessments to determine which levees can and should be rebuilt. “There is a good chance” that it won’t be all of them, said the Corps’ Krajewski, noting that funding is limited.
Some farmland along the Missouri could be flooded for years awaiting repairs and would have to be cleared of silt and debris before being planted again.
The decision to abandon farmland is complicated by that fact that catastrophic floods are unpredictable, said Ken Kunkel, a NOAA researcher.
”But it seems to me, like in lot of situations when you’re in a flood plain, expecting to be completely protected by anything probably is unwise and becoming unwiser as time goes on,” Kunkel said.
———
Some experts say U.S. agriculture policy discourages farmers from adopting practices that could help reduce losses to extreme weather.
Conservation programs that pay farmers to set aside land, including in flood plains, are underfunded, experts say. The taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance program effectively discourages farmers from planting more than a couple of crops and gives them an incentive to plant on risky land because some losses would be recouped.
It’s also easier to obtain loans for certain crops, such as corn, wheat and soybeans in the Midwest, said Ben Lilliston, rural strategies and climate change director at the Minnesota-based Institute for Agriculture & Trade Policy. That makes it difficult for farmers to rotate several crops, which preserves soil health and helps weather floods and drought.
After a crippling year, many farmers will need to return to low-lying fields if they can.
Walter, the Iowa farmer, considered abandoning 750 acres (304 hectares) of bottomlands, but it was a huge chunk of the 1,200 acres (486 hectares) he farms with his son.
So they’ll continue farming it once the levees are repaired, he said.
But farmers need to ask themselves if the risk of farming in flood plains is worth the reward, said Dukes, the Purdue ecologist.
“Is it worth the great yields you might get in great years versus the total loss in other years?” he said. “Do taxpayers want to be subsidizing the losses?”

Huawei asks court to throw out US telecom funds ban,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/huawei-asks-court-throw-us-telecom-funds-ban-67508388,"
Chinese tech giant Huawei is asking a U.S. court to throw out a rule that bars phone carriers from using American government money to purchase its equipment on security grounds.
The lawsuit announced Thursday is Huawei’s second legal challenge this year to U.S. government efforts to reduce its market access.
American authorities say Huawei Technologies Ltd., one of the biggest global makers of smartphones and network gear for phone carriers, is a security risk, which the company denies.
Huawei’s lawsuit in U.S. federal court says the Federal Communications Commission acted improperly when it voted last month to bar rural carriers from using government subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei or its Chinese rival, ZTE."

"Reddit bans accounts, suspects possible UK vote interference",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/reddit-bans-accounts-suspects-uk-vote-interference-67566738,"
The prospect of Russian interference in Britain's election flared anew Saturday after the social media platform Reddit concluded that people from Russia leaked confidential British government documents on Brexit trade talks just days before the general U.K. vote.
Reddit said in a statement that it has banned 61 accounts suspected of violating policies against vote manipulation. It said the suspect accounts shared the same pattern of activity as a Russian interference operation dubbed ""Secondary Infektion"" that was uncovered earlier this year. 
Reddit investigated the leak after the documents became public during the campaign for Thursday's election, which will determine the country's future relationship with the European Union.         All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs. 
Reddit said it believed the documents were leaked as “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia."" 
“We were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination,'' Reddit said.
The British government has not challenged the authenticity of the documents.
Britain's main opposition party has argued the documents prove that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party is seeking a deal with the United States after Brexit that would drive up the cost of drugs and imperil the state-funded National Health Service. The issue has been a central election theme, largely because the country deeply cherishes the health service, which has suffered under years of austerity. 
Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the 451 pages of documents, which covered six rounds of preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators, proved that Johnson was planning to put the NHS “up for sale” in trade talks. Johnson — who was not prime minister for most of the two-year period when the trade talks took place — has rejected Corbyn's analysis.
Britain is currently scheduled to leave the 28-nation EU on Jan. 31.
When asked about Reddit's actions while on a campaign stop in Wales, Corbyn suggested the news was an “advanced stage of rather belated conspiracy theories by the prime minister.''
”When we released the documents, at no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real, deny the arguments that we put forward. And if there has been no discussion with the USA about access to our health markets, if all that is wrong, how come after a week they still haven't said that?"" he said. 
Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that the government is ""looking for and monitoring"" anything that might suggest interference in the British election. 
""From what was being put on that (Reddit) website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference,'' Morgan said. ""And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious.''
The spectre that Russia has meddled in Britain's electoral process has been raised before. Critics are also questioning the British government’s failure to release a Parliament intelligence committee report on previous Russian interference in the country’s politics. They say it should have been made public before Thursday's vote.
The Times of London reported, without saying how it got the information, that the intelligence report concluded that Russian interference may have affected the 2016 referendum on Britain’s departure from the EU, though the impact is “unquantifiable.” 
The committee said British intelligence services failed to devote enough resources to countering the threat and highlighted the impact of articles posted by Russian news sites that were widely disseminated on social media, the newspaper reported.
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson expressed concern about the new Russian interference claims.
""All of us should be concerned if a foreign country is trying to interfere in our democracy,'' she said. 
“And that is why it is so appalling that the prime minister is sitting on a report that was written weeks before the general election, that the Security Committee say should be published, into interference in U.K. democracy by foreign countries like Russia.”

France threatens retaliation if US doubles Champagne price,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/france-threatens-eu-retaliation-us-wine-tariff-plan-67455956,"
France is bristling at a U.S. threat to slap 100% tariffs on French cheeses, Champagne and other products, with the French leader telling President Donald Trump on Tuesday that the move would amount to an attack on all of Europe.
The U.S. Trade Representative         proposed the tariffs on $2.4 billion in goods Monday in retaliation for a French tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook.
France’s reaction was swift and robust, with President Emmanuel Macron and his finance minister both warning of a European riposte if the U.S. measure is implemented.
“We’ll see where the discussions lead in the coming weeks, but it will involve a European response,” Macron said in a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London. “Because, in effect, it wouldn’t be France that is being sanctioned or attacked but Europe.”
Macron said it’s “not fair” that digital revenues are taxed less than real-life revenues. He said France shouldn’t be singled out for wanting to correct that imbalance with a tax on tech firms.
“My first question is what will happen with the United Kingdom, which adopted the same tax? For Italy, the same tax? Austria, Spain ...,” Macron asked. “If we’re serious, those countries will have to be treated the same way.”
The U.S. move is likely to increase trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe. Trump said the European Union should “shape up, otherwise things are going to get very tough.”
“I’m not in love with those (tech) companies, but they’re our companies,” Trump said ahead of his meeting with Macron.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the U.S. tariff threat is “simply unacceptable. ... It’s not the behavior we expect from the United States toward one of its main allies.”
The French tech tax, he said, is aimed at “establishing tax justice.” France wants digital companies to pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they make money instead of using tax havens, and is pushing for an international agreement on the issue.
The problem is pronounced in Europe, where a foreign company can pay most of its taxes in the one EU country where it has its regional base - often a small country like Luxembourg or Ireland that tries to attract multinationals with very low corporate taxes.
Le Maire noted that France will reimburse the tax if the U.S. agrees to the international tax plan.
French wine and cheese producers expressed dismay about being caught in the middle of the battle over digital revenues. Cheese producers warned the U.S. measure would hit small businesses hardest.
An industry association for pungent Roquefort cheese, among the targeted products, said the 100% tariffs could wipe out the U.S. market - 300 tons a year - for the blue-veined cheese.
“We’re lucky to have a product known around the world but the reverse side of that is that every time there’s a trade dispute, Roquefort is systematically targeted,” said Jerome Faramond, the association president.
Le Maire said France talked this week with the European Commission about EU-wide retaliatory measures if Washington follows through with the tariffs next month.
EU Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario said the EU will seek “immediate discussions with the U.S. on how to solve this issue amicably.”
The U.S tariffs could double the price American consumers pay for French imports and would come on top of a 25% tax on French wine imposed last month over a separate dispute over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative charges that France’s new digital services tax discriminates against U.S. companies.
France disputes that, saying it targets European and Chinese businesses, too. The tax imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenues of any digital company with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros.
The U.S. investigated the French tax under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 — the same provision the Trump administration used last year to probe China's technology policies, leading to tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports in the biggest trade war since the 1930s.

Toyota North America CEO Jim Lentz to retire after 38 years,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/toyota-north-america-ceo-jim-lentz-retire-38-67658898,"DETROIT -- 
He was the face of Toyota in the U.S. during the automaker's unintended-acceleration crisis. He steered it through the Great Recession, started and closed the youth-oriented Scion brand and reorganized the company's North American operations. 
Now, after 38 years in a number of leadership roles with Toyota, Jim Lentz is retiring, effective April 1. 
Lentz, 64, will step down as CEO of Toyota Motor North America, and will be replaced by Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa, who currently chief operating officer, Toyota said Wednesday. 
Lentz is most well known for his February 2010 testimony before a congressional committee investigating complaints about Toyota vehicles accelerating without warning. Lentz was candid, saying that recalls of some 8.5 million vehicles worldwide and more than 6 million in the United States might not solve the problems. 
He said at the time that an electronic cause could not be ruled out, although Toyota and U.S. government agencies did make controversial determinations later that the problem was caused by sticky gas pedals and floor mats pushing on the accelerator, not electronics. Toyota was fined $50 million for being too slow to report safety problems to U.S. regulators.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Lentz said the unintended-acceleration saga taught him that it's important not only to listen to customers and government regulators, but to understand them.
“It's important that you be transparent,” he said. ""Make quick decisions, implement them quickly and move on.""
Lentz, who started his automotive career at Ford Motor Co. in 1978, joined Toyota in 1982 and worked his way up through the sales operation. 
In 2003 he launched the Scion brand to lure people 18 to 34 to the aging Toyota family. Scion, with funky designs, did appeal to some younger buyers, but sales slumped and it was folded into the Toyota brand in 2016.
After becoming chief executive of the North American region for the whole company in 2013, Lentz made the bold decision to combine Toyota's siloed U.S. manufacturing, sales and finance operations. In 2017 he relocated the company's North American headquarters from California to the Dallas suburb of Plano, Texas.
He called the move “One Toyota” and said it got all of North America on the same page, improving the speed of decision making to handle fast-paced industry changes.
“I'm convinced the new norm for any business is just chaos,” Lentz said. “It's been chaos since 2009.”
Lentz said he has positioned Toyota in the U.S. to handle the shift away from cars to trucks and SUVs, as well as a pending shift to electric, hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell propulsion systems. Toyota also has partnerships and is developing its own autonomous vehicles. Lentz said the move to autonomous or electric vehicles will take a long time, and even if he stayed longer, he wouldn't be around long enough to see the company through the changes.
So now it's time to leave Toyota to what Lentz said is a strong U.S. leadership team. He plans to stay in Texas, improve his golf game and see his two granddaughters more often. Lentz said he may join the board of a corporation or nonprofit at some point.

"Judge: Purdue workers should get bonuses, but maybe not CEO",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bankruptcy-judge-considers-13m-bonus-purdue-pharma-ceo-67490609,"
More time is needed to sort out whether the CEO of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma should receive a $1.3 million bonus next year, but the company should be allowed to pay about $35 million in bonuses to 682 other employees, the judge overseeing the company's bankruptcy case said Wednesday.
There were objections at the hearing only to payments to CEO Craig Landau and a group of nine other upper-level “insider” employees. State governments and a watchdog committee didn't dispute the company's contention that bonuses would be needed to keep employees working and the company running — especially after the company agreed to trim many of the bonuses.
Judge Robert Drain said he would sign an order for all the employees except Landau to get bonuses next year. He said it would contain a provision that it could be withheld from anyone found liable in lawsuits over the toll of the opioid crisis linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.
Purdue, based in Stamford, Connecticut, is in bankruptcy court as part of an effort to settle more than 2,700 lawsuits it's facing over the toll of opioids.
Drain said officials with the company and other interested parties should continue to discuss whether it's appropriate for Landau, who has run the company since 2017, to receive a performance bonus on top of his $2.6 million base salary.
Drain said on the bench that he wasn't especially moved by the contention from a group of 24 states that Landau should have his pay docked because of a possibility that he could be held liable in the future. 
But he said he was concerned when it was revealed at the hearing that the CEO's base salary was doubled in 2018 shortly after the company hired a law firm to consult on filing for bankruptcy — and that the same year, he received $6 million of the $12 million in retention payments that he had been scheduled to get from 2020 through 2026.
Purdue lawyer Marshall Huenber said those changes were not a tricky move to pay the CEO more with the possibility of bankruptcy looming but rather part of bigger changes to his compensation that includes a reduced severance package if he leaves the Stamford, Connecticut-based drugmaker.
In the hearing, Landau's lawyer, Linda Imes, said Landau, a medical doctor who joined Purdue in 1999 and became CEO in 2017 after a stint running its Canadian sister company, was behind a decision last year to stop marketing opioids to doctors.
“Dr. Landau is a star, and he is a star that Purdue should have working for it in this challenging time,"" she said.
In their lawsuits, Colorado and Massachusetts allege that Landau blamed the dangers of opioids on patients rather than the drugs and that he knowingly put patients at risk by having his sales team encourage more prescribing of the drug without disclosing the addiction risks.
They say he pushed opioids for elderly patients and those who had never taken them before without disclosing their risks, falsely claimed that a version of OxyContin that was reformulated to make it harder for people to break down and misuse was safe, and pushed doctors to prescribe opioids for a longer period of time.
“Purdue should not award bonus payments to Landau before resolving the allegations that Landau committed deadly, illegal misconduct,” those states and others said in a filing this week.
Purdue and Landau deny the claims. In court filings, Landau said he had no role in overseeing sales or marketing for much of his career at the company.
Whether troubled companies should be allowed to pay bonuses to executives and other critical employees is a common topic debated during bankruptcy proceedings. In 2009, a judge ruled that Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, could pay 230 traders bonuses totaling $50 million to keep working through that company’s bankruptcy. This year, a judge approved paying rank-and-file workers for Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. $235 million in bonuses but nixed millions in extra pay for top executives.
In Purdue's case, the company says two dozen employees have resigned since it filed for bankruptcy in September and that replacements are hard to find.
“Purdue continues to be a difficult place to work, and retaining and motivating Employees continues to be a challenge,” chief financial officer Jon Lowne said in a court filing this week. “In recent weeks, Employees have received an unprecedented barrage of calls from recruiters.”

US labor board rules for McDonald's in unionization case,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-labor-board-rules-mcdonalds-unionization-case-67696420,"
The National Labor Relations Board has ruled in McDonald's favor in a long-running case filed by 20 workers who were fired or faced retaliation for trying to unionize. 
The board said Thursday that it favors a settlement that will require McDonald's franchisees to pay $171,636 to the affected workers. The franchisees must also notify current and former employees about the settlement and set up a $250,000 fund to handle future claims.
The workers were seeking a ruling that would consider McDonald's a “joint employer” with its franchisees. That would have increased the company's liability and potentially have made it easier for McDonald's 850,000 U.S. workers to form a union. 
But Chicago-based McDonald's insists it doesn't directly employ the workers. About 95% of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants are owned by franchisees. 
An administrative law judge with the labor board rejected the proposed settlement in July 2018, saying it was unlikely to end the dispute and didn't require McDonald's to enforce the settlement. 
McDonald's appealed to the full board, which agreed with the company. The case will now return to the administrative law judge, who has been directed by the board to approve the settlement."
Health program offers free HIV prevention drug to uninsured,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/health-program-offers-free-hiv-prevention-drug-uninsured-67461298,"
The government launched a new program on Tuesday to provide an HIV prevention drug for free to people who need the protection but have no insurance to pay for it.
Taking certain anti-HIV drugs every day dramatically reduces the chances that someone who is still healthy becomes infected through sex or injection drug use. But only about 18% of the 1.2 million Americans who might benefit got a prescription last year, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. And for those without insurance, the drugs can cost up to $2,000 a month.
Expanding access to what’s called PrEP — for pre-exposure prophylaxis — is one key to the Trump administration’s ambitious goal of ending the nation’s HIV epidemic by 2030.
“We have the tools to stop the spread of HIV in its tracks. It’s about execution,” Azar told The Associated Press.
The HHS program is for the uninsured to seek free PrEP doses. Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. has         agreed to donate enough of its HIV prevention medicines for up to 200,000 people a year over 10 years.
To qualify, people must have a valid prescription and a negative HIV test and must lack prescription drug coverage. They can apply through a new website,         GetYourPrEP.com. Once approved, they'll be provided a card with a number necessary for their pharmacy to fill the prescription at no cost, officials said. 
The uninsured aren’t the only the concern. Even though most insurers cover PrEP, co-pays still can be obstacles, especially for people with high-deductible plans. 
Gilead, based in Foster City, California, sells the only two brands of PrEP, Truvada and Descovy, approved in the U.S. A cheaper generic version of Truvada is expected next fall. 
Getting doctors to ask their patients about HIV risk factors and educating the public about PrEP also are hurdles. PrEP use has increased since 2016, when just 9% of those qualified got a prescription for HIV prevention, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The increase is a good sign, but “progress is not fast enough,” Mermin said.
There are about 38,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year. President Donald Trump's administration aims to reduce those by 75% in five years and by 90% in 10 years.
Azar said the Gilead donation, first announced in May, wasn’t affected by a patent-infringement lawsuit HHS recently filed against the company, arguing taxpayer-funded research helped lead to the recognition that certain drugs initially used to treat HIV also could prevent it.

American Airlines doesn't see Boeing Max flights until April,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/american-airlines-boeing-max-flights-april-67698279,"FORT WORTH, Texas -- 
American Airlines is pushing back the return of its Boeing 737 Max planes another month, removing the plane from its schedule until April 7.
American said Thursday that it based the decision on the latest guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Department and Boeing.
The airline said that if the FAA certifies the plane, it could operate flights with only employees and invited guests before April 7.
American had 24 Max jets when they were grounded in March after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia and expected to receive more during the year. It has canceled thousands of flights because of the grounding. American CEO Doug Parker has said Boeing, not American, will shoulder the cost of those cancellations.
Chicago-based Boeing has been working on changes to flight software and computers, but the process has taken far longer than the company expected. "
Cyber Monday projected to be the biggest online shopping day in US,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/cyber-monday-track-biggest-online-shopping-day-us/story?id=67438305,"
Cyber Monday is expected to be the largest online shopping day in the U.S., raking in about $9.2 billion in online sales.

After wintry weather hit huge swaths of the U.S. on Black Friday and through the weekend, more customers seemed to turn to online shopping this year. States that had more than 2 inches of snow saw a 7% increase in online sales, according to data from Adobe Analytics.

Total online sales ere projected to hit $9.2 billion on Monday, according to the Adobe data. The total, while down slightly from projections earlier in the day of $9.4 billion, is still up 16.9% from last year.
The projected numbers were released just before the so-called ""golden hours of retail,"" according to Adobe, with 30% of all Cyber Monday sales taking place from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. ET. Of course, those purchases are right before the deals evaporate. About $11 million will be spent every minute during those four hours, Adobe said.

In addition to the record $9.2 billion in overall online sales, Adobe said a single-day record of $3 billion was spent by customers using smartphones Monday.
""Just look at Black Friday, which brought in $7.4 billion online and is just below last year’s Cyber Monday at $7.9 billion,"" Taylor Schreiner, the principal analyst and head of Adobe Digital Insights said in a statement. ""Consumers are reimagining what it means to shop during the holidays, with smartphones having a breakout season as well. We expect that consumers will spend $14 billion more this holiday season via their phones.""

On Black Friday, an estimated 42% of all e-commerce sales were made on a smartphone, according to the data. Moreover, 61% of all visits to online retailers on Friday were coming from a smartphone device.

Cyber Monday brings some of the year's biggest discounts on toys, TVs and computers, with deals averaging around 20% off. If you're seeking furniture or bedding, the Adobe data recommends waiting for the deals on Giving Tuesday.
Black Friday this year racked in a record $5.4 billion in online spending, which means consumers spent an average of $5.3 million per minute in online purchases that day, according to Adobe data.

This holiday season, consumers are on track to hit a total of $143.7 billion in total online spending between November and December.

"GM, Korea's LG Chem in venture to build factory in Ohio",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gm-koreas-lg-chem-venture-build-factory-ohio-67516971,"
General Motors and Korea's LG Chem have formed a joint venture to build an electric vehicle battery cell factory near Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. 
The companies also will work together on battery technology to bring down the cost for future GM electric vehicles. 
The new plant will create more than 1,100 jobs in the area around Youngstown, Ohio, and the joint venture plans to invest $2.3 billion in the plant and for battery development. GM says it will be among the largest battery factories in the world.
They'll break ground on the new plant sometime next year, but the exact location wasn't disclosed.
The new battery plant comes after GM closed a sprawling small-car assembly plant in Lordstown earlier this year. The battery plant was announced last fall during contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, but it won't make up for the lost jobs at the small-car plant. 
The Lordstown factory stopped making cars in March. Just two years ago it employed 4,500 workers on two shifts who made the Chevrolet Cruze compact car. Most of those employees either retired or transferred to other GM factories. 
GM has been working with LG Chem on electric vehicle batteries since 2009, shortly before the Chevrolet Volt rechargeable gas-electric hybrid went on sale. LG Chem now supplies battery cells for the Chevrolet Bolt fully electric vehicle.
Hak-Cheol Shin, LG Chem CEO, said the joint venture will reduce electric vehicle costs to the point where they can replace those powered by internal combustion engines.
“We believe by working together we’ll accelerate and get to industry-leading cost levels,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said.
Workers at the new plant will decide whether they want to be represented by the UAW, the companies said.
The joint venture likely will pay less than the roughly $30 per hour that GM pays unionized assembly plant workers. Barra said the plant will follow GM's component manufacturing strategy, where workers are paid less than at assembly plants. She said it will have to be cost-competitive.
Cells from the factory will go into the next generation of GM electric vehicles, including a new battery-electric pickup truck scheduled to go on sale in 2021.
Battery cells from the plant likely will be shipped to factories where the electric vehicles are made, where they will be assembled into battery packs, GM said. 
GM has promised that it would have 20 battery-powered vehicles on sale globally by 2023.
The company says the battery cell plant, along with the recent sale of the closed Lordstown assembly plant to a commercial electric vehicle company, positions northeast Ohio to become a major hub for electric vehicle technology and manufacturing.
GM is gambling big that the public will someday accept electric vehicles instead of those run by internal combustion engines. Barra says GM believes that climate change is real and is looking toward an all-electric future.
But fully electric vehicles currently make up about 1.5% of U.S. new vehicle sales, and LMC Automotive forecasts it will rise to only 7.5% by 2030. The forecasting firm doesn't see EV sales hitting 50% of the market until at least 2049. Globally it's a different story. Navigant Research sees growth from just over 1 million sales last year to 6.5 million by 2025. The surge is expected because of government incentives and fuel economy regulations in China.
Barra said the next generation of GM electric vehicles will be desirable and affordable to consumers as well as profitable for the company. 
The tie-up with LG Chem will help GM get its electric vehicle range to about  300 miles (480 kilometers)  per charge, which is what research shows consumers are looking for, Barra said. Batteries from the joint venture will give GM the ""right energy density to meet customer demand and have some variety in what best suits customer needs.""
The state of Ohio is working with the joint venture on an incentive package for the new factory, but Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said the terms won't be disclosed until the details are finshed. 
He said the Lordstown area has plenty of land for the new factory, but would not say if a site had been picked.
“The people in that part of the state will be very eager to make accommodations to make sure this facility is successful,"" Husted said. 
The companies made the announcement Thursday morning at GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan, north of Detroit.

Forever war: US and China struggle to defuse trade conflict,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/forever-war-us-china-struggle-defuse-trade-conflict-67465873,"
Businesses and investors have been nervously monitoring U.S.-China trade talks for months, hoping the world’s two biggest economies can de-escalate their trade war and restore some predictability to global commerce.
President Donald Trump delivered another setback to the optimists Tuesday, saying he was willing to wait until after the 2020 elections to close a deal with Beijing.
His comments came a day after Trump unexpectedly reversed his own policy on a separate trade front and pledged to tax steel from Brazil and Argentina. On top of that, his administration proposed to target $2.4 billion in French imports in a retaliatory move over France’s new digital tax. The Trump administration says France’s tax unfairly targets American tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.
Trump’s mercurial statements and actions on trade have rattled investors this week. In late morning trading Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 400 points.
Dan Digre has long since stopped expecting much from U.S. negotiations with China. He’s heard it all before.
Digre’s 70-year-old family firm, Misco Speakers in St. Paul, Minnesota, is caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China conflict. Misco is absorbing Trump’s tariffs on the parts it buys from China for the specialized speakers it makes for the aircraft and medical device industries, among others.
“I’m hopeful that something will happen, but I’m not optimistic,’’ Digre said. “There have been so many false deals: A deal is close, a deal is close — then nothing.’’
Both sides may have an incentive to reach a deal before Dec. 15. That’s when the Trump administration is set to start taxing an additional $160 billion of Chinese imports. These tariffs would hit many Chinese-made goods that are on holiday shopping lists — smartphones and toys, for example — and would extend Trump’s tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States.
A former Trump administration official who has been briefed on the talks and requested anonymity to speak frankly said the U.S. is considering delaying the Dec. 15 tariffs if the talks go well — but keeping the option to restore the tariffs if no progress is made toward a more comprehensive agreement.
The signs have been mixed.
Last week, Trump said “We’re in the final throes of a very important deal.” And China’s Commerce Ministry reported that its negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, had spoken by phone with his U.S. counterparts, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The official Xinhua News Agency said the men had discussed their “core concerns’’ and “agreed to maintain communication on remaining issues in consultations on the Phase 1 deal.”
Earlier, China had made goodwill gestures, issuing improved guidelines for protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property and lifting a five-year ban on American poultry.
Then Trump’s comments Tuesday seemed to suggest that a breakthrough might not come anytime soon.
It’s been a year and a half since Trump declared that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.’’ But his war with China has dragged on and on, with each side imposing — and raising — import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods. Those taxes are paid by companies that import those goods. These importers must either absorb those higher costs or pass them on to customers in the form of price increases.
Negotiators have met 13 times. Truces have come and gone. Predictions of peace have proved premature.
For now, at least, the reality remains: The United States is taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, and Beijing is retaliating with tariffs on $120 billion of American products. Not since the 1930s has the world seen such intense trade warfare.
The two sides are fighting over allegations that China has deployed predatory tactics in its drive to achieve global dominance in such advanced technologies as quantum computing and electric cars. The administration asserts, and many China analysts agree, that these tactics include stealing sensitive technology, unfairly subsidizing their own firms and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to China’s market.
On Oct. 11, Trump had announced what he cast as a breakthrough: Beijing had agreed to buy far more U.S. farm products — as much as $50 billion worth annually, the administration said — and to better protect intellectual property. In return, the United States suspended plans to raise tariffs on $112 billion in Chinese goods.
Even though this so-called Phase 1 deal left the thorniest issues for future negotiations, the two sides still haven’t managed to finalize it.
“It now looks likely that a Phase 1 deal will be rather limited in scope, hardly resolving the broader trade-related uncertainty that continues to cloud business sentiment in both countries,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who formerly led the China division at the International Monetary Fund.
Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the Trump administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.
The prolonged trade war has been inflicting economic damage. Factories have cut purchases and investments because they don't know whether or when Trump will lift his tariffs or which countries he might target next.
The president’s sudden move Monday to take action against Argentina and Brazil underscored how unpredictable his policies are. Last year, he had agreed to exempt the two countries from tariffs on steel and aluminum. But he reversed that decision in a tweet Monday morning, accusing Argentina and Brazil of manipulating their currencies lower to give their exporters a price advantage. In fact, their currencies are plunging because their economies are in crisis.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration ratcheted up tensions with Europe by announcing plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on cheese, Champagne and lipstick and other imports from France to protest a French digital services tax.
The administration is also readying taxes on $7.5 billion worth of European Union imports in a dispute over illegal EU subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
The tariffs and the uncertainty they generate have hurt the U.S. manufacturing sector, which many economists say is already in recession. On Monday, a private survey found that American factory output had fallen for the fourth straight month.
At Misco Speakers, CEO Digre is postponing investments, trying to negotiate discounts with suppliers and hoping he won’t be forced to reduce his 100-person workforce. He’s planning a trip to the Philippines to find a supplier that isn’t subject to Trump’s China tariffs.
“The damage it does to a business is multiple,’’ Digre said. The tariffs are “a drain on your cashflow,” and “rather than spending the time developing new things, you’re trying to find someone else to make the same thing.’’
And then, he said, there’s “the uncertainty of: What’s going to happen next? Is it going to go on another year? Is it going to go on another five years?’’

Boy on hospital floor dominates Britain's election campaign,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/boy-hospital-floor-dominates-britains-election-campaign-67601912,"
A 4-year-old boy in a Spider-Man top lying on a hospital floor took center stage Monday in Britain's election campaign, as the opposition painted his plight as a symptom of the country's ailing health system and branded Prime Minister Boris Johnson heartless for avoiding looking at his photo.
The story of 4-year-old Jack, splashed across the front page of the left-leaning Daily Mirror newspaper, overshadowed campaigning for Thursday's general vote as Johnson and his Conservatives hunted for crucial votes in traditional Labour Party strongholds.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, toured southwest and central England, where his left-of-center party is trying to cling on to key constituencies.
All 650 seats  in the House of Commons seats are up for grabs in this election, which is also expected to break Britain's political impasse over Brexit and determine its future relationship with the European Union. 
Jack's mother, Sarah Williment, told the Mirror she covered him with coats to keep him warm as he awaited assessment at Leeds General Infirmary last Tuesday. Rushed to hospital amid fears he had pneumonia, Jack was eventually diagnosed with flu and tonsillitis and sent home.
Williment told the newspaper she usually votes Conservative, but will be voting Labour for the first time this week.
Both Labour and Johnson's Conservatives are pledging to pour funds into Britain's state-funded National Health Service after years of only modest increases under Conservative governments. Corbyn accuses Johnson of planning to put Britain's cherished health service “up for sale” in post-Brexit trade negotiations with the United States — a charge that Johnson strongly denies.
It was Johnson's clumsy reaction to the story that turned it viral. A video of the prime minister briefly declining to look at a photo of Jack had been viewed more than a million times by mid-afternoon Monday.
In the clip of the interview, ITV reporter Joe Pike said to Johnson: ""You refuse to look at the photo. You've taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister."" 
Johnson then took the phone out of his pocket, looked at the photo on the screen, and said: “It's a terrible, terrible photo. And I apologize obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS.” 
He subsequently returned the phone and apologized for taking it.
Labour Party health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth blamed the situation on Conservative funding cuts and said the prime minister's initial refusal to look at the photo “is a new low for Boris Johnson. It's clear he could not care less.”
The spat came as opinion polls give the Conservatives a lead, but as many as one in five voters remain undecided. This election is especially unpredictable because the question of Brexit cuts across traditional party loyalties. Britain is now scheduled to leave the EU on Jan. 31.
Underscoring the significance of those shifting allegiances, Johnson's first campaign stop was in the eastern port of Grimsby targeting Labour voters who also backed leaving the EU in the U.K.'s 2016 referendum.
Wearing a white jacket, hat and rubber boots, Johnson lugged a crate of fish across the floor of a fish market in the town that has been ruled by the Labour Party for 74 years. Johnson said he was “taking nothing for granted” in the final days of campaigning. He later swapped his white fish market garb for a bright yellow high-visibility jacket as he campaigned in northeast England.
The Conservatives had a minority government before Thursday's election. Johnson pushed for the vote, which is taking place more than two years early, in hopes of winning a majority of seats in the House of Commons and breaking Britain's political impasse over Brexit. He says if the Conservatives win a majority, he will get Parliament to ratify his Brexit divorce deal and take the U.K. out of the EU by Jan. 31.
Labour is promising to renegotiate the divorce deal, then give voters the choice in a referendum of leaving the EU on those terms or remaining in the bloc.
Speaking in London, Labour Party official John McDonnell outlined what a Labour government would do in its first 100 days if elected — including making good on election pledges to nationalize public utilities and launch a “green industrial revolution” to tackle climate change. He also said the party would hammer out a new Brexit deal to be put to a second referendum.
""Despite all his promises, it is clear to all now that far from getting Brexit done, under Johnson, Brexit won’t be done for years or we risk a catastrophic no deal,"" McDonnell said.

US threatens duties 'up to 100%' on French goods,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-administration-threatens-tariffs-100-french-goods/story?id=67459311,"
The Trump administration threatened the possibility of slapping additional duties of ""up to 100 percent on certain French products"" in response to a digital services tax France has leveled against the U.S.

Products that could be hit with the new proposed tariffs include French wines, cheeses, beauty products, handbags and more.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released a statement Monday slamming France's digital services tax as ""discriminatory"" and ""unusually burdensome"" for U.S. companies impacted, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.
In response to the digital tax, the USTR proposed additional tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of French goods, including additional duties of up to 100% on certain products.

The decision ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on U.S. companies,"" USTR Ambassador Robert Lighthizer said in the statement.
""The USTR is focused on countering the growing protectionism of EU (European Union) member states, which unfairly targets U.S. companies, whether through digital services taxes or other efforts that target leading U.S. digital services companies,"" the statement added.

The new proposed tariffs on French goods are currently open for public comment, and a committee will hold a public hearing on Jan. 7. The USTR ""expects to proceed expeditiously thereafter,"" according to a statement.

Meanwhile, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the new U.S. tariff threat ""simply unacceptable,"" according to the Associated Press. ""It’s not the behavior we expect from the United States toward one of its main allies,” he added.

Le Maire defended the digital tax as a way of forcing tech companies to pay their fair share of taxes instead of using countries as tax havens, the Associated Press reported.

The French Association of Wine and Spirit Exporters called on ""urgent action"" by their government in response to the U.S. tariff threats in a tweet Tuesday.Taxe sur les services digitaux : suite aux nouvelles menaces 🇺🇸pesant sur la filière #Vin 🇫🇷, @FEVS_France demande une action urgente du Gouvernement @EmmanuelMacron @JBLemoyne @BrunoLeMaire @n_delattre @VerdierJouclas @PhilHoganEU @jwojc
Stock also fell Tuesday for French luxury goods brands LVMH and Hermes International in the wake of the news.

DHS may require US citizens be photographed at airports,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dhs-require-us-citizens-photographed-airports-67476028,"
Federal officials are considering requiring that all travelers — including American citizens — be photographed as they enter or leave the country as part of an identification system using facial-recognition technology.
The Department of Homeland Security says it expects to publish a proposed rule next July. Officials did not respond to requests for more details.
Critics are already raising objections.
Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Tuesday he will introduce legislation to block the plan and prohibit U.S. citizens from being forced to provide facial-recognition information. He said a recent data breach at Customs and Border Protection shows that Homeland Security can’t be trusted with the information.
Facial recognition is being tested by several airlines at a number of U.S. airports. American citizens are allowed to opt out of being photographed, although a 2017 audit by a federal watchdog agency found that few U.S. travelers exercised that right — barely more than one per flight.
Federal law requires Homeland Security to put into place a system to use biometrics to confirm the identity of international travelers. Government officials have made no secret of their desire to expand the use of biometrics, which they say could identify potential terrorists and prevent fraudulent use of travel documents.
Homeland Security announced the possibility of expanding biometrics to U.S. citizens in a recent, brief filing. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security, said there would be a chance for the public to comment on any change in regulations.
In a November 2018 report, Homeland Security said facial recognition is the best biometric approach at borders because it can be done quickly and “with a high degree of accuracy.” The agency said privacy risks “are mostly mitigated.” Photos used to match Americans to their identities are deleted within 12 hours, according to the report.
Jay Stanley, a policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government has told the public and Congress repeatedly that American citizens would be exempt from mandatory biometric screening.
“This new notice suggests that the government is reneging on what was already an insufficient promise,” Stanley said in a statement. ""Travelers, including U.S. citizens, should not have to submit to invasive biometric scans simply as a condition of exercising their constitutional right to travel.”"
PG&E's $13.5B deal with fire victims removes huge obstacles,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pges-135b-deal-fire-victims-removes-huge-obstacles-67610406,"
Pacific Gas and Electric will be able to avoid two legal obstacles that could have tripped up its efforts to bounce back from bankruptcy if California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a federal judge approve a $13.5 billion settlement with victims of catastrophic fires blamed on the utility's equipment.
The company provided a clearer picture of its remaining bankruptcy path in a Monday regulatory filing that provided more details about the deal. 
The settlement will allow Pacific Gas and Electric to skip a January civil trial to determine whether the company was liable for a 2017 Northern California wine country fire that killed 22. It also would cancel plans for a federal court hearing that was supposed to estimate the company's total bill for all the fires tied to its power systems from 2015 through 2018. 
Facing potential damages of up to $30 billion, PG&E filed for bankruptcy last January.
If a judge had deemed the liabilities much higher in a trial, Pacific Gas and Electric could have been rendered insolvent — a result that would have blown up its plan to reorganize its finances and resume normal business operations after emerging from bankruptcy protection next summer.
“This is exciting news for PG&E. They didn't want to have anything to do with going before a jury,"" said Jared Ellias, a professor with the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has been closely following the utility's bankruptcy case.
Investors also seemed relieved. PG&E's stock climbed nearly 16% Monday to close at $11.18.
For now, both the state and federal court hearings are hold and are supposed to be shelved entirely, as long as the settlement with the fire victims gets the required approvals within the next two weeks.
Newsom has until this Friday to sign off on the settlement, which meets his demands to substantially raise the $7.5 billion that Pacific Gas and Electric had previously earmarked for fire victims. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali has until Dec. 20. 
The governor's office said Newsom is reviewing the settlement to ensure it meets his goal of treating both the fire victims and Pacific Gas and Electric employees fairly while also putting the utility on more stable financial footing to make the extensive upgrades to its grid in the future. 
Pacific Gas and Electric had no immediate comment Monday, and the utility confined its comment to the explanation its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A lawyer representing the bankruptcy committee for fire victims didn’t respond to request for comment Monday.
The deal with the fire victims will make it easier for Pacific Gas and Electric to meet a June 30 deadline set by California to get out of bankruptcy to it can be partially protected from future fire losses by a special fund set up by the state.
But it still isn’t all smooth sailing for the nation's largest utility. The San Francisco company still must defeat a competing plan for its reorganization submitted a group of bondholders. The proposal lost its previous support from fire victims as part of the $13.5 billion settlement.
The company also is still awaiting Montali’s approval for a separate $11 billion settlement with 110 insurers who have already paid policyholder claims in the fire. That deal faced fierce resistance from fire victims who feared it would drain PG&E of all its cash, leaving them in the lurch or forced to accept nothing but stock in a company that could be worthless.
The new deal with fire victims calls for Pacific Gas and Electric to pay them $6.75 billion in cash, staggered in installments that will begin with the settlement's approval and continue through January 2022. The remaining $6.75 billion will consist of stock in the reorganized company, giving fire victims a nearly 21% stake in the utility, according to Monday's filing.
The stock payment will be a boon for the fire victims if the company fares as well as it did after it ended a three-year stint in bankruptcy protection in April 2004. The company's stock soared from about $29 to a high of $71.57 in September 2017, just before a massive fire signaled PG&E could face huge financial headaches for years.
The fire risks underlying the utility's current trip through bankruptcy make this one much different than the first one, which was caused by a botched attempt at electricity deregulation. As a result, Pacific Gas and Electric is likely to face a bumpier ride out of bankruptcy, making it more likely its stock may swing more wildly too.
“There is nothing in this settlement that solves the problem that PG&E is still going to be running a really risky business,” Ellias said."
"For banks, data on your spending habits could be a gold mine",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/banks-data-spending-habits-gold-mine-67441092,"
There’s a powerful new player watching what you buy so it can tailor product offerings for you: the bank behind your credit or debit card.
For years, Google and Facebook have been showing ads based on your online behavior. Retailers from Amazon to Walgreens also regularly suction up your transaction history to         steer future spending and hold your loyalty.
Now banks, too, want to turn data they already have on your spending habits into extra revenue by identifying likely customers for retailers. Banks are increasingly aware that they could be sitting on a gold mine of information that can be used to predict — or sway — where you spend. Historically, such data has been used mostly for fraud protection.
Suppose you were to treat yourself to lunch on Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping day of the year. If you order ahead at Chipotle — paying, of course, with your credit card — you might soon find your bank dangling 10% off lunch at Little Caesars. The bank would earn fees from the pizza joint, both for showing the offer and processing the payment.
Wells Fargo began customizing retail offers for individual customers on Nov. 21, joining Chase, Bank of America, PNC, SunTrust and a slew of smaller banks.
Unlike Google or Facebook, which         try to infer what you’re interested in buying based on your searches, web visits or likes, “banks have the secret weapon in that they actually know what we spend money on,” said Silvio Tavares of the trade group CardLinx Association, whose members help broker purchase-related offers. “It’s a better predictor of what we’re going to spend on.”
While banks say they’re moving cautiously and being mindful of privacy concerns, it’s not clear that consumers are fully aware of what their banks are up to.
Banks know many of our deepest, darkest secrets — that series of bills paid at a cancer clinic, for instance, or that big strip-club tab that you thought stayed in Vegas. A bank might suspect someone’s adulterous affair long before the betrayed partner would.
“Ten years ago, your bank was like your psychiatrist or your minister — your bank kept secrets,” said Ed Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Now, he says, “they think they are the same as a department store or an online merchant.”
The startup Cardlytics, one of the field’s pioneers, runs the offer programs for Wells Fargo, Chase and other banks. Though these partnerships, Cardlytics says it gets insights on about $2.8 trillion worth of annual consumer spending worldwide.
A Cardlytics rival named Augeo runs a similar program with other banks, which it declined to name. American Express has an in-house program for its cardholders. Visa targets offers on Uber’s app for credits toward rides and food delivery.
Even though banks only know where you’ve shopped — and not specifically what you bought — they’re often able to make educated guesses. After all, it’s not likely you’re at a liquor store for the potato chips.
The bank can then infer other things you may like. It would have a pretty good idea that you’re about to travel if you’ve charged a flight or hotel stays. HSBC is looking into using that data to set up automatic alerts, so that it wouldn’t decline your card use as fraudulent when you start charging for meals in Kathmandu or Karachi.
The next step is to make location-specific offers, perhaps for a car rental, as soon as you land. Marcos Meneguzzi, HSBC’s U.S. head of cards and unsecured lending, said cardholders will welcome such offers, at least when they’re relevant. But he warns that banks could easily overstep and lose their customers’ trust.
Many of these efforts remain in their infancy, and it’s not yet clear how well they’ll catch on. The Cardlytics programs, for instance, don’t push offers through notifications. You have to look for them in your banking app or website.
Abeer Bhatia, an executive with Chase’s credit-card business, said commissions barely cover operational costs. To Chase, the program is more important for incentivizing rewards-conscious consumers to use its cards. If a Chase card gets you an extra 10% at Rite Aid, why pull out your Citi card?
As far as these companies are concerned, Americans have repeatedly demonstrated that they value freebies and discounts more than intangible privacy concerns.
“Consumers understand the banks are giving them ways to save money based on how they shop,” said Scott Grimes, CEO and co-founder of Cardlytics.
But banks often don’t explain clearly what they’re doing with your data, even though they sometimes share your transactions with outside data companies such as Cardlytics to process offers. And many banks don’t seek explicit consent, instead including these programs by reference in general agreements for the card or online banking.
“It’s totally long, and people don’t read that,” said Saisattha Noomnual, a graduate student in Chicago who gets targeted offers through her Chase and Bank of America cards.
Under federal law, banks merely have to let you withdraw from marketing, or opt out. That’s difficult to do if you’re not aware it’s happening.
Noomnual said she can only guess she gets more offers for Starbucks because she visits Starbucks a lot. She reasons that based on how well banks analyze her spending for fraud alerts. While she said she doesn’t mind that, she wishes banks were more forthcoming.
Bank of America declined comment. Chase said it tries to keep disclosures simple and understandable without overwhelming consumers.
Banks insist they don’t share personal information with other companies because they replace names with anonymous ID numbers. Privacy researchers, however, have         shown that such data can be “de-anonymized” under the right conditions.
Privacy advocates worry that past transactions could come back to haunt you. Frequent visits to fast-food joints might flag you as a health risk, which could be a problem if your health insurer could pay to learn about that. Auto insurers might grow wary of cardholders who run up large bar tabs.
And ultimately, these targeted offers could inadvertently encourage people to overspend or double down on unhealthy habits such as fast food.
“Consumers aren’t aware of the subtle nudges apps are giving them to buy, buy, buy,” Mierzwinski said. “They are basically digging deep into your psyche and figuring out how to manipulate you.”"
Deadly defect found in another version of Takata airbags,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bmw-park-older-series-cars-due-air-bag-67495398,"
A new and distinct problem has been discovered in air bags made by the now bankrupt company Takata which has led to at least one death. 
The recently discovered malfunction is different than the defect that led to at least 24 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide, though the result, like the earlier issue, leads to air bags that can explode and hurl shrapnel, killing or injuring people. 
Takata is adding about 1.4 million front driver inflators to recalls in the U.S., according to government documents posted Wednesday. 
BMW is warning owners of some older 3-series cars to stop driving them. 
A driver in Australia was killed by an airbag malfunction, while another Australian and a driver in Cyprus were injured, according to government documents.
Included in the recall Wednesday are more than 116,000 BMW 3-Series cars from the 1999 to 2001 model years. About 8,000 definitely have faulty inflators and should be parked, BMW said. The rest can still be driven.
In addition, certain Audi, Honda, Toyota and Mitsubishi vehicles made from 1995 to 2000 also are being recalled, but information on which models was not available Wednesday.
Unlike previous recalls, the Takata non-azide inflators do not use volatile ammonium nitrate to fill the air bags in a crash. But the air bag propellant can still deteriorate over time when exposed to moisture and explode too fast, blowing apart the inflator body. They also might not fully inflate to protect people in a crash.
Takata says in government documents that it made about 4.5 million of the inflators worldwide but only a portion are still in use because the vehicles are so old. The faulty inflators have problems with insufficient seals.
Toyota and Honda said they're still figuring out which models will have to be recalled. U.S. safety regulators said they were told by Mitsubishi that the only U.S. vehicle affected is the 1998 through 2000 Montero. A company spokesman was seeking more information.
In a statement, Audi said it is investigating whether any 1997 to 1999 model year A4, A6, A8, or TT vehicles are affected in the U.S. 
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement  that it is in discussions with automakers about the recalls. It urged owners to search for recalls in the coming weeks by entering their vehicle identification number at         www.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls      
In the BMW recalls, the company is recommending that people stop driving certain 1999 323i and 328i sedans made from July of 1998 through January of 1999. Spokesman Oleg Satanovsky said those cars have inflators that were made at a Takata factory and are known to be faulty because they were manufactured before production improvements.
The company also is recalling another 34,000 323i and 328i sedans from 1999-2000 and 323Ci and 328Ci coupes from the 2000 model year. These cars were made from March of 1998 through March of 2000 and have inflators made at two Takata plants that could be defective. Satanovsky says these cars will be inspected and some could get new inflators.
A third group of cars, just over 74,000, is being recalled. This group includes 323i, 325i, 328i, 330i sedans from the 1999 through 2001 model years. They were produced from May 1999 through July of 2000 and may have had air bag inflators replaced by defective ones. They also will be inspected.
BMW is still developing a remedy for the problem, but the company intends to replace faulty inflators with new ones. The company says owners will be notified when parts are available.
The recall is another in a long saga of problems with Takata inflators that sent the company into bankruptcy.
Nineteen automakers are recalling about 70 million inflators in what has become the largest string of automotive recalls in U.S. history. The company is recalling about 100 million inflators worldwide.
Most of the recalled inflators use ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and inflate the air bags. But the chemical deteriorates when exposed to high temperatures and humidity and can burn too fast, blowing apart the canister designed to contain the explosion.
The remnants of Takata were purchased by Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems for $1.6 billion (175 billion yen). A message was left seeking comment from the successor company, Joyson Safety Systems.

Stocks jump as November jobs growth blows past forecasts,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stocks-jump-november-jobs-growth-blows-past-forecasts-67545527,"
A surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report put investors in a buying mood Friday, driving stocks on Wall Street broadly higher and extending the market’s winning streak to a third day.
The rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by more than 300 points and erased the S&P 500's losses from earlier in the week, nudging the benchmark index to a second consecutive weekly gain.
Technology, financial and industrial stocks drove much of the gains. Utilities, a safe-play sector, were the only laggard. Bond yields rose.
The Labor Department said employers added 266,000 positions, well above estimates of 184,000. The report also showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low. Separately, an index that measures how consumers feel about the economy showed an increase from last month.
The encouraging reports offer reassurance for investors who may have been worried that consumers might be pulling back on spending, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
“Increasing jobs, people back to work, plus that jump in consumer confidence tells you that the consumer is still there, and probably will still spend money,” he said. “It's a better than we expected set of data, and clearly the market is pricing that in.”
The S&P 500 rose 28.48 points, or 0.9%, to 3,145.91. The index posted a 0.2% gain for the week, a solid pivot from losses of more than 1% as of late Thursday. It’s now within 0.3% of its all-time high set on Nov. 27 and up 25.5% so far this year.
The latest gains also helped stem some of the losses for the Dow and Nasdaq.
The Dow climbed 337.27 points, or 1.2%, to 28,015.06. The Nasdaq gained 85.83 points, or 1%, to 8,656.53. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 19 points, or 1.2%, to 1,633.84.
Friday’s batch of encouraging economic data capped what started as a rough week for the market.
Increased trade tensions and disappointing economic reports -- including data showing manufacturing continues to shrink and growth in the service sector is slowing -- dragged the market to steep losses on Monday and Tuesday. 
The latest employment report and consumer sentiment data are a welcome development as steady job growth has been one of the bright spots in the economy, along with solid consumer spending.
Investors also got some encouraging news on the U.S.-China trade front, with Beijing saying Friday that it is waiving punitive tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork as negotiations for a trade deal continue.
Financial markets were rattled this week when President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t mind waiting until after the 2020 elections for a trade deal. Wall Street has been hoping enough progress can be made on a “phase 1” trade agreement to avert new tariffs on Chinese goods, such as laptops and cellphones, set to become effective on Dec. 15. China has been seeking relief from some tariffs as part of the negotiations.
“You're getting feel-good news going into the weekend,” Haworth said. “It doesn't mean, to my mind, that all the concerns are off the table. One of the risks we'll have in the coming week is you still haven't gotten the phase 1 deal.”
Gains by technology sector stocks helped drive the market rally Friday. Micron Technology rose 2.8%.
Banks also rose, as the solid jobs report sent bond yields higher, which lenders rely on to charge higher interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.84% from 1.79% late Thursday. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.5%.
Industrial stocks also notched solid gains. 3M rose 4.3%.
Uber fell 2.8% after a safety report revealed that more than 3,000 sexual assaults were reported during its U.S. rides in 2018. The report is part of the ride-hailing company’s effort to be more transparent after years of criticism over its safety record.
Benchmark crude oil rose 77 cents to settle at $59.20 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained $1 to close at $64.39 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.65 per gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 cents to $1.95 per gallon. Natural gas fell 10 cents to $2.33 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $17.80 to $1,459.10 per ounce, silver fell 46 cents to $16.48 per ounce and copper rose 6 cents to $2.71 per pound.
The dollar fell to 108.55 Japanese yen from 108.74 yen on Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.1056 from $1.1099.
Major stock indexes in Europe finished higher.

"Warren slams moderate rivals, laying bare ideological divide",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/warren-wealth-tax-estimates-optimistic-analysis-67683222,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- 
Elizabeth Warren lashed out Thursday at her moderate Democratic rivals seeking the White House, accusing them of naively accepting Republican calls for unity rather than standing up to the rich while too quickly bending to the whims of their own wealthy donors. 
The Massachusetts senator strongly defended her progressive vision for the nation built on using new taxes to extend benefits such as universal child care and health coverage. Warren didn't name former Vice President Joe Biden or Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, but she was clearly taking aim at them — suggesting that long-simmering tensions between the party's centrist and progressives wings are boiling over.
“Unlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not counting on Republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big-business accountability they have opposed under Democratic presidents for a generation,"" Warren said during a speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. “Unlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if Democrats adopt Republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well-connected will stand down.""
The comments were some of the most strident for a candidate who rode a steady rise in the polls throughout the summer to become a front-runner but lately has seen that support stall as Buttigieg and Biden seem to have grabbed some momentum. 
“We know that one Democratic candidate walked into a room of wealthy donors this year to promise that ‘nothing would fundamentally change' if he’s president,” she said, referring to past comments by Biden. Referencing Buttigieg's fundraising prowess, she said, “We know that another calls the people who raise a quarter million dollars for him his ‘National Investors Circle,’ and he offers them regular phone calls and special access."" 
“When a candidate brags about how beholden he feels to a group of wealthy investors,"" Warren added, “our democracy is in serious trouble.” 
Warren remains bunched near the top of the polls with Biden, Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the race's other strong progressive voice. But rather than contrasting herself with Sanders to shore up the Democratic left, she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president — as well as billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The division is growing as the first votes of the Democratic primary near, and there's mounting concern that no clear front-runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests.
“Nobody is perfect, and nobody is pure. And there’s no question that any Democrat running for president would be better than Donald Trump,"" Warren said Thursday. “But voters will not trust a candidate who won’t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors. And voters will be right.""
In response to Warren's speech, Buttigieg senior adviser Lis Smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine Democratic unity. 
“Sen. Warren's idea of how to defeat Donald Trump is to tell people who don’t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party,"" Smith said. 
Warren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system. She wants a 2% tax on fortunes worth $50 million-plus and a levy three times that on anyone who has a net worth of more than $1 billion. She pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and free tuition at public universities while wiping out most student debt for 42 million Americans and helping finance a “Medicare for All"" plan providing government-sponsored health care nationwide. 
But some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier Thursday, when the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model — which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals — released         findings showing that Warren's wealth tax will raise $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion over 10 years. That's as much as $1.4 trillion less than Warren’s campaign estimates. 
The analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0.9% to 2.1% by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce “private capital formation” enough to drive the U.S. economy’s average wage down 0.9% to 2.3%, even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax.
Warren’s wealth tax has been among the most popular — and most scrutinized — proposals of her campaign. Although Sanders has         proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes,  Warren's has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of “2 cents!” 
Responding to the analysis after her New Hampshire speech, Warren said it wasn't really based on what she wants to do, saying the authors “changed provisions and then analyzed something else.""
“I understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don't really have any comeback to that central question and that is, ‘Why aren't we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else?'"" she said. 
Still, even Warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda, noting in her speech: “Will I have a magic wand to enact my full agenda? Of course not. No president does. I know I will have to compromise, but that’s not where we start.""
She said she'd exploit Senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority — noting that Republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by Trump. But pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near-universal Democratic unity. 
Buttigieg, appearing on CBS on Thursday, took his own shot at one piece of Warren's policy agenda, saying, “I’m not going to promise that we can just wave away all student debt."" 
The mayor said he personally understands the effects of taking on debt to pay for school but “that doesn’t mean I can just say we’re going to make it all go away and it’s all free now.”
In New Hampshire, Warren noted that any Democrat who has “fought for real change"" has been branded a socialist or radical. 
“Here’s a news flash,"" she said. “If you defend a corrupt system, where corporate lobbyists write the rules to squeeze out competition and hurt economic growth and undercut workers, you’re not a capitalist. You’re just a cheater.”

Uber weighs next steps after jarring sex assault report,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uber-weighs-steps-jarring-sex-assault-report-67571257,"
A day after Uber revealed that more than 3,000 riders and drivers were sexually assaulted last year while using its service, attention is turning to what's next for the ride-hailing giant and whether its plans to improve safety go far enough.
Uber's report was hailed by victims' rights organizations for taking a step that other companies have so far been unwilling to match. But it's unclear whether the transparency will help rebuild trust or backfire by showing customers how deep Uber's safety problems go.
In the safety report, Uber said 464 people were raped while using its services in 2017 and 2018. Almost all of them — 92% — were riders. It's difficult to compare those statistics to other modes of transportation, because U.S. taxi companies and transit agencies generally do not collect similar national data.
Even so, many said the report shows Uber has work to do.
“This is a major crisis situation that they're going to have to deal with because the brand's built on safety, and even though some could try to say it's a small number, it's still way too high — it's higher than zero — and I think that shows a gap in their screening process,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. The revelations give “meat on the bones” to regulators, including those in London who chose not to renew Uber's license over safety issues, he said.
Uber has been working to improve safety over the last two years, rolling out features including an in-app emergency button, a ride-check feature that detects unexpected stops or crashes and the ability for riders or drivers to share their location with loved ones during a ride. The company outlined additional safety steps it will take in the report.
On Monday, Uber plans to launch in seven cities a feature to give riders a four-digit number that they can use to verify that they are getting into the right car. Next year, it plans to launch a survivor support hotline staffed by RAINN, a sexual violence organization, and to provide sexual misconduct education for drivers. The hotline may encourage more victims to report attacks.
The report only covers Uber's U.S. operations. The U.S. and Canada brought in 63% of Uber's revenue last quarter. Lyft said it would release its own safety report, but it has not indicated when.
Critics say Uber should be doing more, particularly with background checks, to weed out potentially dangerous drivers. Unlike many taxi companies, Uber and its main U.S. rival, Lyft, do not check drivers' fingerprints against a national database.
The gold standard for background checks is fingerprinting “because someone can easily fake a Social Security number,"" said Dominique Penson, an attorney who has represented sexual assault victims. “You can't fake a fingerprint. And if somebody has been convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States, that will appear in a national database, and when you run that fingerprint, you'll know.""
Uber says the FBI has acknowledged its database is incomplete and does not always include a final disposition. The company's process includes a motor vehicle screening, a criminal background check and ongoing notifications about any new offenses.
An added fingerprint check could add precious time to the driver-approval process at a time when both Uber and Lyft are fiercely competing for market share. 
Dashboard cameras also could help by recording incidents and serving as a deterrent for bad behavior, said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. Campbell encourages drivers to get cameras, but the ride-hailing companies have not encouraged the practice.
“Even if you have dashcam footage, it's hard to get Uber and Lyft to actually look at the footage,"" Campbell said.
Last month, Uber announced it would allow passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico to record audio of their rides.
A U.S. House committee is looking at legislation that could reduce the number of sex assaults involving ride-hailing passengers and drivers, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said Friday.
The committee has discussed requiring fingerprint background checks, camera monitoring and front license plates for ride-hailing cars in states that don’t have them. This would help prevent fake ride-hailing drivers from picking up passengers by making it easier for passengers to check plate numbers against the ones provided by Uber and Lyft, DeFazio said.
In Eugene, Oregon, fingerprint checks earlier this year by the local police department found about two dozen Uber and Lyft drivers had criminal records that were missed in the companies’ checks, DeFazio said. One was a convicted murderer, while another was a registered sex offender, according to The Register-Guard newspaper. The city stopped the people from driving for the companies.
There may be limits on what federal legislators can do. Ride-hailing companies could be regulated federally because they conduct interstate commerce, but that is new legal territory, he said.
Still, he applauded Uber’s report, saying the company had done more than any of its competitors “by just reporting,"" DeFazio said. “There’s more to be done, for sure.”
The report raised alarm among some riders.
“I think I've taken it a little bit for granted, the fact that the app already tracks who I am and where I'm at,"" said Mary Yao, 28, an MBA student at U.C. Berkeley. “I think I'll be more conscientious next time I climb into a car to not always be on my phone. So it has made me raise my awareness a little bit.”
Bryant Greening, an attorney and co-founder of LegalRideshare, a Chicago law firm that specializes in ride-sharing cases, noted that more than 40% percent of the reported sexual assaults, which include incidents less serious than rape, were against drivers, who also are at risk.
“There’s no more dangerous place to be than in a moving car with a stranger,” Greening said. “You are really vulnerable without a clear path to escape. So this system, rideshare, needs to be made safe for everybody who is in that car.”

"German exports rise in October, defying expectations",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/german-exports-rise-october-defying-expectations-67590844,"
German exports posted a second consecutive month-on-month increase in October, defying economists' expectations of a slight decline.
The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that exports rose 1.2% compared with the previous month. That followed a 1.5% increase in September. 
In year-on-year terms, exports were up 1.9%, led by a 4.6% rise in demand from countries outside the European Union. Exports to other EU nations rose only 0.1%.
German imports were flat compared with September and down 0.6% on the year.
The unexpectedly upbeat exports report followed data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both declined in October. Germany only narrowly avoided entering a recession in the third quarter."

The Latest on the NATO summit in London (all times local):
7:05 p.m.
French President Emmanuel Macron said Europeans should play a greater role within the NATO military alliance in order to be less dependent on the United States.
Macron said he wants “more European defense to get ... a less unbalanced NATO.” That came after he met with Turkish President Erdogan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the sidelines of a NATO summit.
He also said he requested clarifications from Turkey, without elaborating. Macron strongly criticized Turkey’s military operation in Syria and its role within the NATO alliance.
Macron reaffirmed he wants to improve relations with Russia. He said while Europe and Russia disagree on some issues, they are also partners in other areas.
The comments come after Macron met with President Donald Trump amid tensions over the French leader’s recent comments that NATO is experiencing “brain death.”

President Donald Trump says he's not worried that the U.S. stock market took a dive over his remarks that a trade deal with China might not materialize until after the 2020 election.
U.S. stocks fell sharply in early trading Tuesday after Trump cast doubt over the prospect of reaching a trade deal with China this year and threatened to impose tariffs on French goods.
Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the NATO summit in London that the stock market has reached record highs recently so it's OK that the market fell.
He says he has to make the right trade deal with China — one that's good for the United States.
Trump said ''If it's an even deal, it's no good.""
The S&P 500 index fell 1.3% as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 393 points, or 1.4%, to 27,388. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%.

President Donald Trump says he would understand if the leaders of Canada and Mexico get tired of waiting on the United States to pass a new trade agreement among the nations.
Trump says the deal is good for all three nations, calling it one of the few transactions in which all three countries benefit “as a unit against the world.”
Trump is talking about the trade deal in a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted on changes to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to ensure that improved labor and environmental standards are enforced.
The Republican Trump says prospects for the agreement’s passage rest with Democrat Pelosi. He says: “If it gets put up for a vote, it passes, but so far, she hasn’t decided to do that.”

President Donald Trump says NATO member countries that he thinks aren’t spending enough on defense will be “dealt” with either through curtailed trade with the U.S. or possibly a tax.
Trump has complained for a long time that the U.S. is carrying too much of NATO's financial burden and that members that skimp on defense spending are freeloading off America.
Trump referenced countries that aren't keep their commitments and said “maybe I’ll deal with them from a trade standpoint.”
He also says he’ll work something out, “so they have to pay.”
Trump was speaking in London where he is attending at NATO summit.
Before Trump was elected, NATO members agreed to move “toward” a goal of spending 2% of their gross domestic product on their own defense by 2024.
Earlier this year, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the majority of NATO's 29 member countries have plans to reach that goal.

Increasingly tense relations between President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron were on display when the subject of Islamic State fighters surfaced on the sidelines of the NATO summit in London.
Trump says many of the IS fighters who remain detained in the Middle East are from France, Germany and Britain. Trump asked Macron: “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you.”
Macron wasn’t amused.
Macron says he's looking at foreign fighters from France on a case-by-case basis and has taken back some fighters. Several French IS suspects will be returned to France on Dec. 9.
But he says the No. 1 problem is not foreign fighters, but in finishing the war against IS.
Trump told Macron his response was one of the “greatest non answers” he’s ever heard.

President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are criticizing Turkey, which is part of NATO but has taken actions that have angered members of the alliance.
Trump said Tuesday that he had a great relationship with Turkey, although he said that the U.S. was considering imposing sanctions on Ankara for buying a Russian-made missile defense system. He spoke on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London.
Macron says Turkey and France cooperate on security, trade and migration. But he says that it's not possible for Turkey to be a member of the NATO alliance when it buys Russia's S-400 missile system.
The U.S. and other allies say the system is not compatible with NATO forces and could compromise the F-35 fighter jet program and aid Russian intelligence
Macron says NATO needs clarification from Turkey about its commitment to the alliance.

President Donald Trump is acknowledging a ""minor dispute"" over a French digital service tax and U.S. threats to slap new tariffs on French cheese, wine and other products.
Trump says he thinks the two nations will be able to resolve the trade dispute, possibly through some ""mutually beneficial tax.""
He spoke Tuesday to French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the NATO summit in London. The rapport between the two was respectful but appeared cooler than it has in the past.
Trump said he was happy to see NATO members increasing their defense spending but says even more needs to be done to share the financial burden of NATO.
Macron said NATO must not only be concerned about money but needs to refocus itself on new threats facing the alliance.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says that NATO’s expansion poses a threat to his nation’s security.
Putin noted that the alliance was created to counter the Soviet Union and has continued to expand despite the Soviet collapse. He was speaking at a Tuesday meeting with military leaders ahead of a NATO summit in London.
He said that stereotypical “bloc thinking” isn’t a good way to make decisions in “rapidly changing global conditions.”
Putin said the alliance has stonewalled Moscow’s offers to cooperate in tackling global challenges, including international terrorism and countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. He alleged that NATO has treated Russia “rudely” and refused to take its interests into account.
Putin says NATO’s expansion and beefing up of its military infrastructure near Russia’s borders raises a “potential threat.”

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg says climate change increasingly poses security risks, particularly in the Arctic region, and that NATO has a role to play in mitigating its impact.
Solberg says “climate change is a big insecurity creator” because it leads to more migration and less sustainable development that fuels extremism.
She says: “It’s much less costly to prevent climate change than to adapt to it.”
She was speaking in London on Tuesday ahead of a NATO summit.
Singling out China and the United States, Solberg said the challenges posed by global warming cannot be faced “without having the big emitters on board.”
She says China continues to open new coal mines to secure its energy needs even as heavy air pollution threatens the health of its people.

As NATO leaders trade barbs ahead of a tense summit in London, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that Russia is watching developments at the alliance’s birthday meeting “with great attention.”
The 29-country trans-Atlantic military alliance was founded in 1949 to provide collective security for Europe against what was then the Soviet Union.
Peskov said Tuesday that NATO is “a product of the era of confrontation, the Cold War era,” something he says that Russia does not want to return to.
But he says that “an alliance that was created and shaped by the confrontation ideology, of course, can’t bring anything else” but confrontation.
Turkey’s increasingly close relations with Moscow — and its purchase of Russian air defense systems that are incompatible with NATO equipment — has added to tensions among the allies.
But Peskov says those ties are not hurting NATO.
France, meanwhile, also wants closer ties with Russia.

President Donald Trump is vowing to stay out of U.K. parliamentary elections set for this month but is praising incumbent Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s leadership.
Trump says he and Johnson will meet during the two-day NATO leaders’ meeting in London, although the White House has not announced a sit-down.
While the British premier and Trump have a friendly relationship, Johnson is trying to keep Trump, who is unpopular in the U.K., at arms-length ahead of the Dec. 12 elections.
""I don't want to complicate it,” Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
Trump added that he’s a “fan” of Brexit and said he knows “nothing” of Johnson’s Labour Party rival, Jeremy Corbyn.
He described Johnson as “very capable"" and said ""he will do a good job.""
Johnson is set to host Trump and other NATO leaders at a reception in London later Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump says French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent comments that NATO is experiencing “brain death” is very insulting to the military alliance’s other 28 members.
Trump took aim at Macron with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg by his side and called his comments “very nasty.”
Macron said the alliance was experiencing “brain death” in an interview with the Economist published last month, suggesting that the alliance was becoming obsolete.
“Nobody needs NATO more than France,” Trump said.
Trump has repeatedly criticized fellow NATO members and complained that too few nations are on track to meet the alliance goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense by 2024.
Trump also lashed out at France for a digital service tax that he said unfairly discriminates against U.S. tech companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.
Robert Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade representative, on Monday recommended the U.S. respond with $2.4 billion in new tariffs on French cheese, wine and other products.
Trump is scheduled to meet Macron later Tuesday on the sidelines of the NATO summit.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he still will not agree to a NATO defense proposal for Poland and the Baltic nations until the alliance supports Ankara's concerns related to Syrian Kurdish fighters.
Before departing to attend a NATO leaders’ summit in London, Erdogan said he would discuss the issue with the leaders of Poland and the Baltics during the gathering that marks the alliance's 70th birthday.
A plan to defend the Baltic nations in case of a Russian attack requires all member states’ backing.
Turkey has accused NATO allies of backing Baltic countries' security concerns but dismissing threats to Turkey from the Kurdish fighters.
Turkey considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists and invaded parts of northeast Syria to drive them away from its border."

White Castle issues recall of some burgers,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/white-castle-issues-voluntary-recall-burgers-due-listeria/story?id=67609585,"
White Castle has issued a voluntary recall of a ""limited number"" of its frozen six-pack cheeseburgers, frozen six-pack hamburgers, frozen six-pack jalapeno cheeseburgers and 16-pack hamburgers and 16-pack cheeseburgers due to a ""possible presence"" of listeria, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA said on Friday that the recall affected products on shelves at selected retailers with best-by dates ranging from Aug. 4, 2020 to Aug. 17, 2020.
""Any product with these dates on shelves is presently being removed. Any product with a best-by date before or after these best-by dates is not included in the voluntary recall,"" the FDA said.

The agency said there had been no reported illnesses linked to the recalled products.
""White Castle conducts frequent and regular quality assurance tests,"" the FDA said. ""A recent sample conducted by a third party laboratory of its frozen sandwiches from one manufacturing facility showed a presence of Listeria monocytogenes halting any shipment of product to customers. Since the problem was identified White Castle has not shipped any product from this facility to customers. Following rigorous safety testing protocols, all impacted production runs have been identified for destruction. White Castle has maintained complete control of all product produced at the facility since the first indication of a problem.""
Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA.

Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

Consumers who may have bought the products listed in the recall were urged to throw them out or return them to the store for an exchange or refund. They can also contact White Castle at 1-800-843-2728."
Inside the Wild West of the CBD products industry,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/inside-wild-west-cbd-products-industry/story?id=67467783,"
Sitting at home on his ranch in Elk, Washington, Sgt. Ben Hayhurst said he feels most at peace when he's outdoors.

""That's why we moved out here. It's honestly where I'm more comfortable,"" he said.

Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC.

A U.S. Army infantryman, Hayhurst, 41, was deployed in 2004 to Iraq, where he and his unit were part of the siege of Sadr City, now infamously known as ""Black Sunday.""

""There [were] 19 of us and four Humvees that were hit with a large scale ambush. … I think a lot of us believed we weren't going to get out of there,"" Hayhurst said. ""It wasn't just the bullets that hit me. [It] was chunks of concrete and metal. … I figured we would die.""

Hayhurst survived the war, but his physical and emotional wounds were nursed with opiates. He became lost, until he said the hemp plant and CBD helped him live his life again.

""I was in a bad place on the pain meds, on and off suicidal,"" he said. ""And without that change, I don't know that I would be here.""
CBD -- which stands for cannabidiol -- became the ""it"" product of 2019. From cafes to fitness centers, health food stores, delis and even pet shops, CBD is sold in various forms including as an oil and in capsule form to beverages, lotions and even gummies.

CBD is in both marijuana and hemp. Both plants are forms of cannabis, but hemp has less than 0.3% THC and doesn't get its user high.

""CBD is cannabidiol. Cannabidiol is one of over 140 cannabinoids in cannabis plants especially in hemp strains that have very low THC,"" said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, the director of the Addiction Institute at the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System. ""So unlike THC, which when people smoke marijuana cannabis to get high, it's THC that produces the reinforcing effects, the euphoric effects. CBD does not. It's non-intoxicating.""

There is a lot experts still don’t know about CBD and CBD products. Hurd, who has been studying the cannabinoid for a decade, said experts know that CBD can affect transmitters in the brain.

""[CBD] modulates… serotonin that we know is important for anxiety and mood,"" she said. ""And it also impacts on inflammatory processes, even in immune-related systems in the brain.""

The market for these products is predicted to reach $20 billion by 2024, according to BDS Analytics and Arcview Market Research.
Experts, however, say the frenetic growth of the industry is far outpacing the scientific data around the product, leading skeptics to call it snake oil and believers, including pro-athletes to celebrities, to call it a cure-all.

Whereas marijuana is only legal in 11 states and Washington, D.C., for adults older than 21, President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill last year, which legalized hemp and opened the door for the CBD craze.

""The Farm Bill of 2018 that changed CBD from being as a Schedule 1 illegal substance to now being unscheduled and being agricultural has really revolutionized the U.S.,"" Hurd said. ""Therefore, many people have put CBD in water, in coffee, in food, in makeup, in everything.""

CBD comes from a variety of sources. In Hayhurst's case, he uses an oil tincture from the brand Warfighter, a CBD company geared specifically toward veterans. He adds the CBD oil to his coffee every morning.

Warfighter hemp comes from a commercial hemp company in Wellington, Colorado, called Colorado Cultivars, one of the largest organic hemp farms in the U.S. with about 3,500 acres of plants.

""Warfighter hemp was looking for really high-quality CBD product that they could see and have very transparent interaction with the producers,"" said Damien Farris, the director of agronomy at Colorado Cultivars. ""They work with a lot of veterans that have PTSD or were trying to get off of opiates.""
Farris and his team work to genetically breed new and different strains of hemp to test for higher levels of a variety of the plant's uses, including grain production and fiber, but most importantly for their business: CBD.

""We had kind of an idea where it was going to go, but didn't have a complete idea because a lot of the legality on the federal level was not clear and we didn't have a clear timeline when that would happen,"" he said. ""Since the Farm Bill happened last year, at the beginning of this year, the industry has just exploded.""

During harvest, the hemp seeds are separated from the plant's flowers and then sent for processing, where the CBD is extracted. Farris said they go through about 2,000 pounds of hemp an hour.

""So once the dried plant material comes in... we soak it in ethanol and separate the infused ethanol from the dried plant material,"" Farris said. ""We then take infused ethanol, evaporate the ethanol out and we're left with a CBD crude oil that we then further process into distillation.""
From there, the oil is sent to the company's facility in Boulder, Colorado, for mixing and packaging.

""We can make our different products, so our tinctures, our lotions,"" said Janna Geoffrion, a mixologist for Warfighter. ""It starts with mixing. We use like a calculator and it all goes by the percent of the CBD. So we have to have the tests done to know what we're using, and how much CBD and THC is in it and then we formulate the mix to dilute it down to [less than] .03 [% THC].""
Currently, there are no established CBD dosage guidelines, so consumers have to figure out how much CBD is right for them.

Most CBD products, even just from hemp, contain trace amounts of THC, which could be a major turn-off or a hindrance for some, such as people who are drug tested for work.

""There's been a lot of debates about whether or not CBD shows up on on toxicology tests because there can be some interactions with THC, for example,"" Hurd said.
It's something U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe grapples with as CBD has become a mainstay in her recovery routine. Rapinoe said she uses a CBD salve to rub on injuries and also will take CBD gel capsules.

""I use CBD all the time,"" she said. ""Recovery is more and more becoming the most important thing that you can do... as an athlete -- even you know equal to what you're doing on the field.""
Rapinoe, who helped lead the women's team to a World Cup victory, said she uses CBD products not just for pain management after a game, but also to deal with the stress of competition.

""It just helps to calm things down a little bit,"" she said. ""There's certain periods in competition where THC is banned but CBD is legal. So CBD [is] off the WAD [World Anti-Doping] list now.""

It's why Rapinoe and her twin sister, Rachel Rapinoe, started Mendi. The sisters say it's a THC-free line of CBD products designed specifically with pro-athletes in mind.

""I think a lot of people don't understand what CBD is,"" Megan Rapinoe said. ""They don’t understand that the THC is the sort of psychoactive element of it but that if you are just taking CBD, you're not going to get that sort of high feeling.""

""It became very clear that there's like a real fear around testing positive. And just having like any traces of THC,"" Rachel Rapinoe added. ""That way [Mendi] just eliminates any fear of athletes for having any traces of THC in their system.""
As entrepreneurs in a young industry, the sisters have had to navigate evolving regulation.

""There are some of us that are trying to do it the right way,"" Rachel Rapinoe said. ""And as the FDA comes out with more regulations around it, we hope that it's going to wean a lot of those bad eggs out because there are definitely some people in the industry that are selling, you know, basically anything under the hood of their car and they're calling it CBD.""

While it’s not required by law, companies like Mendi and Warfighter said they are taking it upon themselves to ensure quality by sending their products to third-party labs for testing.

""The good companies are companies that ... have third-party verification of what's in that product, that they've done safety test ... to the very bad with companies not caring what they're really putting in the CBD. In fact, they don't even have CBD so I think that unfortunately, the public have to do their own due diligence because the legislation, the regulations have not been strong enough,"" Hurd said.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has cracked down on the illegal marketing of CBD products in food or as a cure for specific health issues. So far, the agency has only approved one CBD-based drug for a formulation called epidolex, which treats two rare and severe forms of child epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

""Other than that, the FDA has not approved CBD for any indication. Why? Research is needed,"" Hurd said. ""Can CBD help uncertain conditions for certain disorders? Absolutely. But we need more clinical trials to be able to give the FDA evidence for them to make this decision about it.""

The agency has also issued notices that CBD could cause health risks, including potential liver injury to male reproductive concerns.
But those who swear by CBD’s benefits are excited to see what the future holds for CBD.

""It's not going to take care of climate change and change your anxiety. It’s not going to do every single thing,"" Megan Rapinoe said. ""But I think that there are a lot of very tangible benefits.""

Hayhurst said that while he knows little medical research has been done on the effects of CBD, he plans to continue using it, as long as he sees the benefits for himself.
""[I'm] better every day, I would say,"" he said. ""Whatever happened in my past, it happened because of the situation I was in -- and you slowly get past that. Those memories will never go away.""

It's been 15 years since Hayhurst was discharged and he said, ""I still deal with daily pain,"" but the main thing he struggles with is the anxiety.

""I feel like that will always, somewhat, be there,"" Hayhurst said. ""But I feel like I'm learning to deal with it through, you know CBD… and therapy and just learning to accept myself for who I am."""

Trump says China deal could wait until after 2020 election,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-china-deal-wait-2020-election-67466434,"
President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the likelihood of reaching a U.S.-China trade deal before next year’s elections — and then shrugged off the tailspin that his remarks caused in the stock market.
Speaking in London, where he is attending a NATO summit, Trump said he had “no deadline’’ to end the 16-month trade war between the world’s two largest economies, which has caused economic damage for both sides.
“In some ways I like the idea of waiting until after the election,"" Trump added.
The president has previously suggested that China wanted to wait until after the election to negotiate a deal.
Stocks began sinking right after Trump’s latest rhetoric shot at the Chinese leadership. His brash remarks could amount to either a short-term negotiating gambit or a sign of his willingness to run for re-election without a breakthrough in the trade war. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 400 points.
Later Trump dismissed the tumult on Wall Street, choosing instead to highlight how much stock prices have risen since the start of the year.
“We have picked up record numbers in our stock markets, so that’s OK. That’s the way I feel.” Trump replied to questions from reporters. “I have to make the right deal. I’m not going to make a deal that’s not going to be great for our country. It can’t be an even deal. If it’s an even deal, it’s no good.”
The trade negotiations with China, the president declared, are at a “critical stage.”
“But if the stock market goes up and down, I don’t watch the stock market, I watch jobs,” Trump said, contradicting the numerous tweets he has sent out when stock markets have set new highs.
Tensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.
On Dec. 15, additional U.S. tariffs are set to kick in on many Chinese-made items, including smartphones and toys. The Trump administration is already taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. imports.
Pressure is building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited ""Phase 1"" deal before the deadline. Still, Trump could end up postponing the tariffs, as he did in October, to allow more time for negotiations.

Judge: Turkish bank can't deny knowledge of criminal charges,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-turkish-bank-deny-knowledge-criminal-charges-67529322,"
A judge cited “extraordinary” and “remarkable” meetings two years ago involving top U.S. and Turkey political figures to intervene in a New York prosecution Thursday as he rejected efforts by a state-owned bank in Turkey to now feign ignorance of criminal charges it faces in the same case.
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman in Manhattan said Halkbank, in effect, could be labeled a fugitive if it refused to send lawyers to represent it against the charges.
A message was left with a lawyer for the bank.
At a hearing last month, Berman said legal maneuvers by the bank were “kind of crazy” as its lawyers asked to challenge the right of an American court and Berman in particular to handle the case but refused to enter a plea on the bank's behalf.
Halkbank was charged with evading sanctions against Iran by processing billions of dollars of Iranian oil revenue. An indictment said the bank illegally moved about $20 billion in Iranian oil and gas revenues, sometimes disguising money movements as purchases of food and medicine so they'd qualify for a ""humanitarian exception"" to sanctions.
Although the bank was not charged until recently, the allegations involving it surfaced in 2015 when a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader was arrested on sanctions charges as he arrived in the U.S. to take his family to Disney World in Florida.
The trader — Reza Zarrab — hired Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, to try to broker a deal between Turkey's president and the U.S. government to resolve the charges. The talks in 2017 failed to result in a deal.
In Thursday's written ruling, Berman said that after Zarrab's arraignment, ""an extraordinary, sustained series of Turkey-initiated state to state meetings, contacts, and involvements began — outside the courtroom — between and among Turkish and U.S. officials, lobbyists and attorneys.”
Berman wrote that the objective of the campaign was initially to obtain the release of Zarrab, despite the criminal charges.
The judge said the “remarkable campaign” involved Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, former Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, Berat Albayrak — Erdogan's son-in-law and Turkish minister of finance, and Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu.
For the Americans, the talks included President Donald Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, ex- Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Berman said.
Zarrab was represented by Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey.
Berman said the campaign to free Zarrab appears to have morphed into an effort to avoid Halkbank being indicted or paying a potential fine. 
“This effort appears to have failed prior to the Halkbank indictment on October 15, 2019,” the judge said.
“If Halkbank wishes the district court to decide its jurisdictional motion, this international bank holds the key to unlock its dilemma: travel to New York and answer the charges or have its legal counsel do so,” Berman said.
“There can be no doubt that Halkbank was notified of the charges against it,” he said.
The judge cited the fact that Halkbank paid for the lawyers for Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted of five of six criminal charges against him, including conspiring to defraud the U.S., bank fraud and conspiracy to violate sanctions against Iran. Zarrab testified against him.
Atilla was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison.
After Atilla's release from a U.S. prison, he returned to Turkey, where he has since been appointed as the head of Turkey's stock exchange, the judge noted."
Technology stocks lead US markets lower in early trading,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/technology-stocks-lead-us-markets-lower-early-trading-67438588,"
Asian shares slipped Tuesday, following a drop on Wall Street amid pessimism over U.S.-China trade tensions.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.7% to 23,379.05. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid 2.0% to 6,725.30. South Korea’s Kospi declined nearly 0.5% to 2,082.45. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.1% to 26,415.70, while the Shanghai Composite was down 0.1% at 2,872.74.
Technology companies led a broad slide for stocks on Wall Street Monday, handing the market a downbeat start to the month after it notched strong gains in November.
Trade tensions flared after China retaliated for U.S. support of protesters in Hong Kong, putting investors in a selling mood. Asian regional markets are generally hurt by declines in trade and the slowdown in the Chinese economy that might cause.
Investors have been hoping that the world’s two biggest economies can make progress toward at least staving off new tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 on $160 billion worth of Chinese products, including smartphones and laptops. The latest friction between Washington and Beijing could hamper that progress.
The S&P 500 index fell 0.9% to 3,113.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1%, to 27,783.04. The Nasdaq lost 1.1%, to 8,567.99. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gave up 1%, to 1,607.58.
The negotiations to end the longstanding trade war could face a tougher path this month following a flareup over Hong Kong.
China said Monday it will suspend U.S. military ship and aircraft visits to the semi-autonomous territory. It also plans to sanction several American pro-democracy groups in retaliation for passage of legislation supporting months’ long anti-government protests.
The law, signed last Wednesday by President Donald Trump, mandates sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses and requires an annual review of the favorable trade status that Washington grants Hong Kong.
“Perhaps the market will now hold the champagne corks that it has been popping for months now in expectation that all is well,” Rabobank said in a report.

Trial begins over T-Mobile and Sprint 'megamerger',https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trial-begins-state-ags-lawsuit-mobile-sprint-megamerger/story?id=67598013,"
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he is ""confident that the law is on our side"" as he leads a coalition of states suing to block T-Mobile and Sprint from merging into one of the nation's largest wireless carriers in a consequential trial that got underway Monday.

The lawsuit from 14 state attorneys general, and the District of Columbia, led by California and New York, is one of the last hurdles T-Mobile must face before it can proceed with buying Sprint for $26 billion, and cutting the number of telecom giants in the nation from four to three.
""It’s hard to believe that going from a market with four big competitors to a market with three big companies will provide the amount of competition that keeps the playing field fair for consumers,"" Becerra said in a press call Monday.

""The more choices we have, the more options we have to get the best, highest quality product at a fair price,"" he added, calling it ""common sense.""

Becerra argued the merger would hurt ""particularly those who can afford it least -- working Americans who continue to live on tight budgets.""

""We’re very confident that the law is on our side,"" he said. ""The T-Mobile-Sprint megamerger would leave consumers with fewer choices and higher prices.""
In October, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve the merger, and the Justice Department gave it the green light with conditions in July.

FCC chairman Ajit Pai formally endorsed the merger in August, saying in his recommendation for approval that it would advance 5G, the next-generation of wireless services, across the U.S.

""After one of the most exhaustive merger reviews in Commission history, the evidence conclusively demonstrates that this transaction will bring fast 5G wireless service to many more Americans and help close the digital divide in rural areas,"" Pai said in a statement.

Pai also argued that ""the merger will promote robust competition in mobile broadband, put critical mid-band spectrum to use, and bring new competition to the fixed broadband market.""
Still, the state AGs argue that reduced competition will hurt consumers, and will especially impact consumers from lower-income and minority communities.

New York Attorney General Letitia James argued in a statement announcing the lawsuit in June that the merger ""would particularly affect lower-income and minority communities here in New York and in urban areas across the country.""

The current market is comprised of four major players: T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. Sprint and T-Mobile have high market shares among low-income populations, according to Becerra's office.

If combined, they would dominate the market for prepaid mobile services, which do not require a credit check, thus hurting the low-income populations that may rely on this service, his office argued.
The DOJ decided in July that T-Mobile and Sprint must divest from Sprint’s prepaid business as part of the merger.

""The megamerger of T-Mobile and Sprint would reduce competition in the mobile marketplace and be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation,"" James said in a statement to ABC News Monday. ""We simply must protect consumers from unchecked corporate dominance and make sure competition in the marketplace yields better outcomes for cell phone customers and workers alike.""

Sprint declined ABC News' request for comment Monday. T-Mobile did not immediately respond to request for comment Monday.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere has previously argued that the merger will ""create a bigger and bolder competitor than ever before -- one that will deliver the most transformative 5G network in the country, lower prices, better quality, unmatched value and thousands of jobs,"" in a statement.

Sprint's executive chairman Marcelo Claure previously referred to the day the merger received Justice Department clearance in July as ""an important day for our country and, most important, American consumers and businesses.""

""We plan to build one of the world’s most advanced 5G networks, which will massively revolutionize the way consumers and businesses use their connected devices to enhance their daily lives,"" Claure added. "
US long-term mortgage rates rise; 30-year loan at 3.73%,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-long-term-mortgage-rates-rise-30-year-67687086,"WASHINGTON -- 
U.S. long-term mortgage rates rose this week. Still, rates remain at historically low levels as a lure to prospective homebuyers. 
Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.73% from 3.68% last week. The benchmark rate stood at 4.63% a year ago. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage rose to 3.19% from 3.14%. 
The average rate for a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage bucked the trend at 3.36%, down from 3.39% last week. 
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left its key short-term rate in a low range of 1.5% to 1.75% after having reduced it three times this year. With the Fed's key rate likely to stay where it is, consumers interested in buying a home or car should continue to enjoy low borrowing costs.
“With the Federal Reserve policy on cruise control and the economy continuing to grow at a steady pace, mortgage rates have stabilized as the market searches for direction,"" Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater said. 
Reflecting the attractive rates, applications for new mortgages and refinancing increased 3.8% in the week ended Dec. 6 from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Freddie Mac surveys lenders nationwide between Monday and Wednesday each week to compile its mortgage rate figures. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates.
The average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 0.7 point this week from 0.5 point last week. The average fee for the 15-year mortgage jumped to 0.7 point from 0.4 point. The fee for the five-year adjustable-rate mortgage was unchanged at 0.4 point. "

A viral tweet reveals an Uber business place in Rhode Island had separate bathrooms for employees and drivers, at a time when tensions between the two groups at the ride-share company are already running high.

""I’ve just always wondered why Uber viewed us as two separate classes,"" Erika Betts, who snapped the photo and shared it on Twitter, told ABC News Thursday.

""These signs are commercially made, somebody made them, somebody ordered them, somebody paid for them,"" she added.The @Uber hub in my market has designated bathrooms.

Betts, 28, said she has been an Uber driver for over two years and was at the Uber Greenlight Hub office in Providence seeking help after finding out via a notification that her account had been deactivated after she says a passenger complained about a surge fare.
""I was waiting to be seen by a representative and I was just noticing the bathroom signs on the door,"" she said. ""It’s always made me a little uncomfortable, I'm not sure what prompted me to tweet about it now.""
Even if drivers wanted to use the employee restroom, Betts says it was always locked and ""you need a key to get in there.""

Uber responded to ABC News' request for comment by pointing to a response to Bett's tweet from Andrew Macdonald, a senior vice president at the company, who said he ""looked into this.""

""This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable,"" Macdonald wrote. ""The signs are coming down today.""Hi Erika - I looked into this. This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.— Andrew Macdonald (@andrewgordonmac) December 4, 2019 Hi Erika - I looked into this. This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.
Macdonald added in a follow-up tweet that the ""bathroom was also being used for employee storage, but that's not an excuse. I don't believe this is the case anywhere else (and it's certainly not our design policy) but we're doing a full review now.""

An Uber spokesperson told ABC News Thursday that the Providence Greenlight Hub was the only location with this signage and that the signs have been taken down.
The signs still sparked outrage on social media, and even caught the eye of a lawmaker.

New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted a link to a news story of the separate bathrooms at the Providence office.Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 5, 2019 Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz
""Siri, show me what classicism looks like,"" she wrote.

In September, California passed a bill that would extend new protections to employees of so-called ""gig economy"" companies including Lyft and Uber, essentially forcing companies to recognize formerly contract workers as employees.

Uber said at the time that the California bill, which is set to go into effect in January, ""does not automatically reclassify any rideshare drivers from independent contractors to employees"" and that it will ""respond to claims of misclassification in arbitration and in court as necessary."" "

France threatens retaliation if Trump hits French goods with 'up to 100%' tariffs,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-administration-threatens-tariffs-100-french-goods/story?id=67459311,"
The Trump administration threatened the possibility of slapping additional duties of ""up to 100 percent on certain French products"" in response to a digital services tax France has leveled against the U.S.

Products that could be hit with the new proposed tariffs include French wines, cheeses, beauty products, handbags and more.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released a statement Monday slamming France's digital services tax as ""discriminatory"" and ""unusually burdensome"" for U.S. companies impacted, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.
In response to the digital tax, the USTR proposed additional tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of French goods, including additional duties of up to 100% on certain products.

The decision ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on U.S. companies,"" USTR Ambassador Robert Lighthizer said in the statement.
""The USTR is focused on countering the growing protectionism of EU (European Union) member states, which unfairly targets U.S. companies, whether through digital services taxes or other efforts that target leading U.S. digital services companies,"" the statement added.

The new proposed tariffs on French goods are currently open for public comment, and a committee will hold a public hearing on Jan. 7. The USTR ""expects to proceed expeditiously thereafter,"" according to a statement.

Meanwhile, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the new U.S. tariff threat ""simply unacceptable,"" according to the Associated Press. ""It’s not the behavior we expect from the United States toward one of its main allies,” he added.

Le Maire defended the digital tax as a way of forcing tech companies to pay their fair share of taxes instead of using countries as tax havens, the Associated Press reported.

The French Association of Wine and Spirit Exporters called on ""urgent action"" by their government in response to the U.S. tariff threats in a tweet Tuesday.Taxe sur les services digitaux : suite aux nouvelles menaces 🇺🇸pesant sur la filière #Vin 🇫🇷, @FEVS_France demande une action urgente du Gouvernement @EmmanuelMacron @JBLemoyne @BrunoLeMaire @n_delattre @VerdierJouclas @PhilHoganEU @jwojc

"Survey: Businesses added just 67,000 jobs in November",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/survey-businesses-added-67000-jobs-november-67488830,"
U.S. companies added just 67,000 jobs in November, a private survey found, barely half the gain of the previous month. 
Payroll processor ADP said that manufacturers, construction firms and mining companies cut 18,000 jobs combined. Companies with fewer than 20 employees also slashed their payrolls. 
November's job gain is the fewest in six months and suggests that hiring could be weakening, economists said. Yet job gains frequently fluctuate from month-to-month, so last month's meager increase could also be a one-time blip. 
It typically takes roughly 100,000 or so new jobs a month to absorb population growth and keep the unemployment rate from rising. If November's modest increase were to continue, the jobless rate could rise from its currently very low level of 3.6%.
The ADP data aren't affected by the GM workers' strike, which ended in late October and lowered hiring in the government's jobs report for October. The return of striking workers is expected to increase job gains in November's official report to be released Friday. 
""The weakness in the ADP report does not guarantee a disappointment in the upcoming (government) data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan.
But Silver said that the disappointing ADP report ""is supportive of our view that the trend in job growth has downshifted lately.""
ADP's figures don't include government hiring and frequently diverge from the government's official report, which is to be released Friday and is expected to show an increase of 190,000 jobs.
Hiring has been steady and resilient throughout the decade-long U.S. recovery. But job gains have slowed this year to an average of 167,000 a month, down from 223,000 last year. 
Trade tensions and slowing global growth have cut into U.S. exports and caused factories to cut jobs for much of this year. Retailers, beset by online competition, have also eliminated jobs.
Still, with unemployment low and wages rising at a decent pace, consumers are still spending and driving economic growth. "
UK voters choose a new government to resolve Brexit impasse,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-voters-decide-resolve-brexit-impasse-67680591,"LONDON -- 
Britons who have endured more than three years of wrangling over their country’s messy divorce from the European Union cast ballots Thursday in an election billed as a way out of the Brexit stalemate in this deeply divided nation.
On a dank, gray day with outbreaks of blustery rain, voters went to polling stations in schools, community centers, pubs and town halls after a five-week campaign rife with mudslinging and misinformation.
The contest pits         Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who says he will take Britain out of the European Union by Jan. 31, against the opposition         Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, who has promised another referendum on Brexit.
All 650 seats  in the House of Commons are up for grabs in the election that is being held more than two years ahead of schedule. Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives have a lead over Labour. But all the parties are nervous about the verdict of a volatile electorate fed up after years of Brexit wrangling.
At a fish market in the eastern England port of Grimsby, seafood company owner Nathan Godley summed up the hopes of many that — one way or another — the election would provide a pathway to a resolution of Brexit. 
“I think we all got a bit weary of the politicians over the last few years really, and I think having a government with a majority to give them the clout to actually do what they want is a good thing,” he said. 
Johnson voted near the prime minister's Downing Street residence in London, accompanied by his dog, Dilyn. Corbyn was greeted by supporters and an activist dressed as Elmo from “Sesame Street”as he arrived to vote in his north London constituency.
The two parties are offering voters starkly different visions of the future. Johnson campaigned relentlessly on a promise to “Get Brexit done” — and promised a modest increase in public spending — while Labour vowed to tax the rich, nationalize industries such as railroads and water companies and give everyone in the country free internet access. 
On Brexit, Labour says it will negotiate a new divorce deal with the EU and then offer voters the choice of leaving the 28-nation bloc on those terms or remaining.
The prime minister pushed for this early election to try to break a logjam in Parliament that stalled approval of his Brexit agreement. He says if he wins a majority, he will get Parliament to ratify his “oven-ready” divorce deal with the EU and take Britain out of the bloc as scheduled on Jan. 31.
Recent surveys suggest the Conservatives' lead may have narrowed in the final days of campaigning. While Labour is unlikely to get an outright majority, smaller pro-EU opposition parties hope to win enough seats so they can team up to block Johnson’s Brexit plans.
The Conservatives have focused much energy on trying to win in a “red wall” of working-class towns in central and northern England that have elected Labour lawmakers for decades but also voted strongly in 2016 to leave the EU. Polls suggest the plan may be working. The Conservatives also have been helped by the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage, which decided at the last minute not to contest 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
Labour, which is largely but ambiguously pro-EU, faces competition for anti-Brexit voters from the centrist Liberal Democrats, the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties, and the Greens.
Labour has tried to focus the campaign on the plight of the National Health Service, a deeply respected institution that has struggled to meet rising demand after nine years of austerity under Conservative-led governments.
One of the campaign's defining images was a photo of a sick 4-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because no beds were available. Johnson's initial failure to even look at the photo put him on the defensive, portraying him as insensitive to the child's plight. 
The photo, initially published by the Yorkshire Evening Post, swept across social media like a firestorm in the final days of the campaign.
For many voters, the election offers an unpalatable choice. Both Johnson and Corbyn have personal approval ratings in negative territory, and both have been dogged by questions about their character.
Johnson has been confronted by his past broken promises, lies and offensive statements, from calling the children of single mothers “ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate” to comparing Muslim women who wear face-covering veils to ""letter boxes.""
In Uxbridge, the suburban London seat that Johnson represents in Parliament, Stefan Hay said he was voting for the prime minister despite his flaws.
“At the end of the day, whether you like him or not, with all of his eccentricities, I think he has leadership ability and I think he is the best man for the job, simple as that,"" Hay said. 
Corbyn has been accused of allowing anti-Semitism to spread within the party. The 70-year-old left-winger is portrayed by opponents as an aging Marxist with unsavory past associations with Hamas and the IRA.
But many voters said they were backing Labour because of its stance on social issues.
“If the Tories win, this country will just fall apart,” said Eleanor Sawbridge Burton, a freelance writer in London. “It will really hit climate change and the NHS. It feels a bit hopeless.”
With so much at stake, political parties have pushed the boundaries of truth, transparency and reality during five weeks of campaigning. 
Social media platforms were a critical battleground, as the parties bombarded voters with messages — many of them misleading.
The Conservatives, in particular, were criticized for using underhanded tactics on social media. The party circulated a doctored video that made it look as if an opposition leader had been stumped when asked about his position on Brexit. Then during a TV debate, the party re-branded its press office Twitter account as a fact-checking service. 
Labour also sought to co-opt the role of independent fact-checker, rolling out a website called The Insider, which urged voters to “trust the facts.”
Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, said the digital campaign showed that the political landscape had changed.
“You don't get more establishment than the British Conservative Party,"" Nielsen said. “If that is what they see as fit and proper, we must confront the fact that this is the new normal.''

"After tragedy, Oregon Christmas tree industry buoyed by bill",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tragedy-oregon-christmas-tree-industry-buoyed-bill-67695420,"GERVAIS, Ore. -- 
It was nighttime when Pedro Lucas came home, clutching receipts showing he had paid a funeral home to have the bodies of three immigrant laborers returned to Guatemala from Oregon.
The three, including two of Lucas' cousins, were killed when a pickup truck slammed into a van carrying them and 10 other Guatemalans home from work at a Christmas tree farm. Lucas’ father, who arrived in America just seven months ago and sent part of his earnings to his wife in the village of Chacaj, was also in the van and remains in a coma, his back broken.
""It’s unknown if he’ll walk again,” Lucas said in Spanish. 
The Nov. 29 crash was a blow to Oregon’s immigrant farm workers, the driving force behind the state's $121 million Christmas tree industry, the nation's largest. 
On Wednesday, spirits were lifted for some when the U.S. House passed a bill that would loosen restrictions on hiring foreign agricultural workers and create a path to citizenship for more than 1 million farm workers estimated to be in the country illegally. The bill’s fate in the Senate is unclear, and the White House hasn’t said if President Donald Trump would sign it. But the 260-165 vote was a rare stroke of bipartisanship on immigration.
The administration has expressed support for growers who say they are desperate for immigrants to fill jobs, even though Trump pinned his 2016 campaign and his domestic agenda to building a border wall with Mexico and introduced policies that make it far more difficult for immigrants to win asylum.
Both growers and Latino workers in Oregon say native-born Americans won’t take these arduous field jobs.
“The person who works in an office, he doesn’t know what it’s like to work out there, how much one suffers out there,” Lucas said as he sat at his dining room table, the funeral home documents in front of him. “In this season — here we’re warm inside — but outside, in the morning when it’s cold and there’s ice, you suffer a lot.”
The deadly crash shed light on an ""invisible work” happening in Oregon, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of a farm worker union called PCUN, an acronym in Spanish for Pine Workers and Farmers United of the Northwest.
The labor takes place mostly out of public view, in Christmas tree farms that blanket parts of Oregon’s foothills and the Willamette Valley, an area renowned for its moist climate and fertile soil.
“People don't realize that the majority of this industry is immigrant labor,” said Lopez, whose own father, a Mexican immigrant, was a Christmas tree planter.
Christmas tree farmers in Oregon, facing a tight labor market this year, used farm labor contractors who found migrant workers in California to help with the tree harvest, according to Oregon Employment Department officials.
The victims of the crash spent their last day loading Christmas trees onto trucks at Holiday Tree Farms, one of the world's largest Christmas tree farms. They received paychecks from a contractor that Friday night in Salem and were headed home when the pickup truck crumpled their van. The Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division is investigating, though a spokesman declined to provide details.
In 2017, 4.7 million Christmas trees were harvested in Oregon, 4 million in North Carolina and 1.5 million in Michigan, the country’s three largest producers, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Oregon doesn’t compile records on the percentage of immigrants in the Christmas tree industry, but it clearly relies on them. So do North Carolina and Michigan.
As the sun burned through fog one recent morning at Hupp Farms, nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Range near Silverton, Oregon, Jan Hupp surveyed stacks of bound Noble and Nordmann firs about to be loaded onto trucks. They were the last among the 30,000 trees that employees and contractors downed with chain saws during this year’s harvest.
“Without immigrants, we couldn’t have done this,” Hupp, a trucker cap pushed back on his head, his blue jeans stained brown and green from soil and trees, told The Associated Press. “People born here don’t want to do this work.”
His farm has 20 employees, 15 of them from Mexico and the rest U.S.-born. Members of contract crews that helped with the harvest were from Mexico or Central America.
Asked Thursday about passage of the U.S. House bill, Hupp replied: “If it's a pathway to get more people who are willing to work, I'm all for that.”
Harvesting is the hardest part of the job, requiring the cutter to bend over with a heavy chain saw to sever the trunk 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) or less above the ground, said Daniel Garibay, a Hupp Farms employee. He originally is from Zarquillas, a town in Michoacán, Mexico, that he said is plagued by shootouts between rival drug gangs.
If the chain saw touches the ground, the chain is immediately dulled and must be replaced, said the bearded 41-year-old.
Asked what was the biggest number of trees he has felled in one day, Garibay responded matter-of-factly: “One thousand.”
Lucas, sitting in a rented house in Gervais, Oregon, that he and his wife, Raquel, share with his father, his cousins and their sons, described dealing with the aftermath of the van crash. He has relied on donations to pay a funeral home $21,750 to have the bodies of his cousins and a third worker, aged 18, sent home.
“They supported me from Florida, Atlanta, Tennessee, Chicago, and many who work on farms in Oregon. All of Woodburn supported me,” Lucas said, referring to a nearby predominantly Latino town. The Guatemalan Consulate in Seattle said it is prepared to assist. 
While arrangements are being made for the bodies to be transported, they are being kept in their caskets an unheated room at City View Funeral Home in Salem.
Standing tall in the lobby, so perfect that it could be mistaken for a fake if not for the piney scent, is a Noble fir Christmas tree.

Elon Musk insists no one interpreted tweet to mean pedophile,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/elon-musk-court-dances-meaning-pedo-guy-tweet-67482929,"
Elon Musk owned up to insulting a British diver in a rash tweet but wouldn’t concede that he called the man a pedophile.
The Tesla CEO returned to the witness stand Wednesday as he faces a defamation lawsuit, trying to dance around the meaning of the “pedo guy” tweet he aimed at Vernon Unsworth, a cave diver who helped rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from a flooded Thailand cave last year.
Musk insisted he did not call Unsworth a pedophile, telling a jury in federal court in Los Angeles that the phrase he tweeted “was obviously a flippant insult, and no one interpreted it to mean pedophile.”
Unsworth's lawyer asked the billionaire how the insult was interpreted in the media worldwide, and Musk said he recalled that news organizations “correctly interpreted it as an insult, not an accusation of pedophilia.”
Musk said he deleted the tweet within hours and apologized on Twitter two days later.
In testimony Tuesday, Musk said the insult meant only “creepy old man.""
The spat began when Unsworth ridiculed Musk’s effort to help in the rescue by having engineers at his companies, including Space X and The Boring Co., develop a mini-submarine that could transport the boys. Despite working around the clock to build the sub, Musk arrived in Thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used.
Unsworth called it nothing more than a “PR stunt” and said Musk could stick the sub “where it hurts.” Musk watched the CNN clip of Unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets on July 15, 2018.
“It was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,” the billionaire said. “It was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.”
Unsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.
Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called “joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.”
The shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.
On the witness stand, Musk gave answers that were at times humorous and sometimes seemed like those of an executive who's under court order to be careful what he says.
Musk is required to have his tweets about Tesla screened as part of court settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he posted misleading information about the company that caused wild stock swings.
His tweet about Unsworth caused Tesla’s stock to drop about 3% the following day, though it recovered a day later.
With his arms crossed, Musk at times squinted and stared off in the distance as he searched for answers to events that occurred more than a year ago.
He clashed at one point with Unsworth's attorney, L. Lin Wood, telling him he interpreted the lawyer’s letter threatening to sue as an extortion attempt.
“I get these shakedown letters a lot,” Musk said. “I think you’re looking for a significant payday.”
Musk's attorney attempted to humanize the billionaire, having him discuss his family — 15-year-old twins and 13-year-old triplets, all boys. Musk choked up talking about a son who died as a baby and his childhood in South Africa.
“It wasn’t good,” he said.
Musk said he was asked to help with the cave rescue and decided to get involved when he heard a Thai navy diver died in the cave system and that a monsoon was forecast that could drown the soccer team.
Musk received no compensation for his efforts, but he acknowledged his work could have been interpreted as a publicity effort.
Though Musk apologized for his tweet about Unsworth, subsequent statements have called into question what he meant.
Musk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile by saying, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”
He told a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth to “stop defending child rapists,” followed by expletives.
Musk was asked about an attempt to dig up dirt on Unsworth.
One of his executives communicated with someone who said he was an investigator but who turned out to be a con man. He was paid $52,000 and produced nothing damning about the diver."
Stocks slump as Trump says trade deal with China can wait,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stocks-slump-trump-trade-deal-china-wait-67462227,"
Asian stock markets followed Wall Street lower Wednesday after President Donald Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year.
Benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% while Shanghai and South Korea also retreated.
Trump said he has ""no deadline"" for a trade deal and doesn’t mind waiting until after next year’s presidential election to make one. Investors had hoped for at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.
Tensions flared last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.
“Until both sides dial down their hawkish rhetoric, markets will continue to pull back earlier optimism,” said DBS Group analysts in a report. “Trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks.”
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.3% to 23,087.80 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gave up 1.1% to 26,093.81.
The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.3% to 2,876.44 and Seoul’s Kospi declined 1.1% to 2,060.81. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 fell 1.5% to 6,611.80 and benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Southeast Asia also retreated.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.7% to 3,093.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% to 27,502.81. The Nasdaq dropped 0.6% to 8,520.64.
Negotiators have yet to agree on details of an interim deal that Trump has called ""Phase 1"" deal.
Investors also are also weighing the potential for additional trade disputes.
On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.
Also Wednesday, Australia disappointed investors by reporting third-quarter economic growth declined to 0.4% over the previous quarter from 0.6% in the three months ending in June. The Australian central bank had described the economy as experiencing a ""gentle upturn.”
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 40 cents to $56.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 14 cents on Tuesday to close at $56.10. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 48 cents to $61.30 per barrel in London. It lost 10 cents the previous session to $60.82.
CURRENCY: The dollar declined to 108.59 yen from Tuesday’s 108.63 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1080 from $1.1084."
Asian shares rise on optimism about US-China trade deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stocks-hopes-us-china-trade-deal-track-67491188,"
Asian shares were rising Thursday amid renewed hopes a U.S. trade deal with China may be nearing, despite tough recent talk from President Donald Trump.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.7% to 23,300.03 in early trading, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added nearly 1.0% to 6,671.90. South Korea’s Kospi inched up nearly 0.1% to 2,070.44. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.6% at 26,228.38, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.7% to 2,897.99.
Shares on Wall Street finished higher, with the gains snapped a three-day losing streak for the S&P 500. The U.S. market has swung sharply for months on every hint of progress about talks between the world’s largest economies, and Asian regional indexes have tended to reflect those fluctuations.
In the latest development, Bloomberg News reported that U.S. negotiators expect a “Phase 1” trade agreement to be completed before U.S. tariffs are set to rise on Chinese products Dec. 15.
The report came a day after Trump said he wouldn’t mind waiting until after the 2020 elections for a deal, a remark that officials reportedly called off the cuff but nevertheless sent markets skidding.
“The trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks,” DBS Group analysts wrote in a report.
The S&P 500 rose 19.56 points, or 0.6%, to 3,112.76. Despite recovering some losses, the index is still down 0.9% for the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 146.97 points, or 0.5%, to 27,649.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 46.03 points, or 0.5%, to 8,566.67. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 11.27 points, or 0.7%, to 1,613.90.
ENERGY:
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 21 cents to $58.22 a barrel. It climbed $2.33, or 4.2%, to $58.43 per barrel Wednesday, as members of OPEC prepare to meet later this week and vote on production levels. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 7 cents to $62.93.
CURRENCIES:
The dollar rose to 108.91 Japanese yen from 108.68 yen Wednesday. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1084 from $1.1088.

Wedding planning sites change policies on slave plantations,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/wedding-planning-sites-change-policies-slave-plantations-67531718,"
Four major websites used for wedding planning are revising their policies on content referencing former slave plantations, responding to an advocacy group's campaign urging the companies to stop promoting venues where black people were once brutalized.
Pinterest says it will now limit distribution of content promoting plantation venues. The Knot and Brides will no longer allow content glorifying the history of plantations. And Zola will stop listing plantation venues on its site altogether. 
All four sites announced the changes this week after receiving letters from Color of Change, which describes itself as the country's largest online racial justice organization with 1.5 million members. The organization also sent a letter to Martha Stewart Weddings, which reached back to the group to start a conversation about the issue. 
“Plantations are not just beautiful or charming places,” said Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, senior campaign director of Color of Change, which objected to such descriptions of plantations in its letters to the companies. “They are places that were intentionally created to force black people to work, torture them and sexual abuse them.”
Pinterest, which couples often use to share and find inspiration for their weddings, said people will still be able to search for plantation venues but the site now shows an advisory warning that some results might violate its policies. The company also will limit autocomplete and search recommendations for plantations searches. Pinterest said it already did not allow plantation wedding venues to advertise on its site and now will take steps to ensure that such ads do not show up on searches. 
“Weddings should be a symbol of love and unity. Plantations represent none of those things. We are grateful to Color of Change for bringing attention to this disrespectful practice,"" Pinterest said in a statement.
The Knot, an online wedding planning platform, said it will prohibit vendors “from using language that romanticizes or glorifies a history that includes slavery."" Similarly, Brides has removed references on its site glorifying plantations, according to a statement from its parent company, Dotdash.
Zola, another wedding planning site, said it would no longer allow former plantations to list on its site altogether. The company initially had responded to Color of Change by saying its complaint did not violate its non-discrimination policy, according to BuzzFeed News, which first reported the story Wednesday.
On Thursday, however, Zola said it had “re-evaluated all our venues listed on Zola and determined we will not allow vendors to list who are plantations.""
Zola CEO Shan-Lyn Ma said the company got in touch with Color of Change on Thursday and was scheduling a conversation with the group. She said the company never promoted plantation wedding venues but now would de-list them. 
“This is really sensitive and painful issue and we want to be doing the right thing by our couples, our employees and anyone who has any interaction with Zola in any way,"" Ma said. 
Ogunnaike said Martha Stewart Weddings reached out to Color of Change on Thursday and expressed interest in starting a dialogue on the issue. Martha Stewart Weddings did not immediately return a request for comment. 
“We are very happy about how receptive the companies they have been. We look forward to larger changes in the wedding industry and the way plantations are viewed across the country,” Ogunnaike said. 
Some former southern plantations have become popular wedding venues over the years but a backlash has been growing. The actors Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds came under fire for tying the knot in 2012 at Boone Hall Plantation and Gardens in Charleston, South Carolina, which was a setting for the 2004 movie “The Notebook.”
The site, which remains a working farm, includes nine of the original slave cabins that were built during the antebellum period. While some old plantations that are open for tours or events don’t include any mention of slavery or enslaved people in promotional materials, Boone Hall’s website includes a section on black history. 
An official with Belle Hall did not return an email seeking comment.

"George Laurer, inventor of ubiquitous UPC, dies at 94",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/george-laurer-inventor-ubiquitous-upc-dies-94-67611047,"
George J. Laurer,  whose invention of the Universal Product Code at IBM transformed retail and other industries around the world, has died. He was 94.
A funeral was held on Monday for Laurer, who died Thursday at his home in Wendell, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh. Sean Bannon with Strickland Funeral Home in Wendell said he had no information on Laurer's cause of death.
Laurer was an electrical engineer with IBM in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park in the early 1970s when he spearheaded the development of t he UPC, or bar code.
The now-ubiquitous marking, composed of unique black bars and a 12-digit number, allowed retailers to identify products and their prices as they are scanned, usually at checkout. 
Laurer said in a 2010 interview that grocery stores in the 1970s were dealing with soaring costs and the labor-intensive requirements of putting price tags on all of their products. The bar code led to fewer pricing errors and allowed retailers to keep better account of their inventory. 
Today, such UPCs are on all kinds of products, services and other items for identification.
“To me, it's just absolutely amazing, because when we were doing this ... I never expected it to be anything like this,"" Laurer told WRAL-TV in 2010. He later produced a patent for one of the first hand-held scanners for reading bar codes, according to an obituary provided by the funeral home. 
A New York native, Laurer served in the Army during World War II and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1951, after which he worked for IBM for over three decades. IBM identified him during the company's 2011         centennial celebration as a contributor to one of the company's 100 iconic moments.
Laurer told WRAL he was still in awe of the invention, which was celebrated on its 25th anniversary at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. 
“ When I watch these clerks zipping the stuff across the scanners and I keep thinking to myself ... ' It  can't work that well,'” he said. 
He was preceded in death by his wife, Marilyn Slocum Laurer. Survivors include four children, as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
"Stocks advance as investors eyes jobs report, trade talks",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-advance-meager-gains-wall-street-67537301,"
Global shares rose Friday as investors awaited what's expected to be a healthy U.S. jobs report, while monitoring the China-U.S. trade talks as more tariffs are due to go into effect this month.
One sign that talks between the world's two biggest economies could be thawing came Friday when China said it is waiving punitive tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork while the two sides negotiate a trade deal.
""Markets are fairly confident we will see President Trump pass on the December 15th tariff threat,""""said Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda.
Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.9% to 7,198 in midday trading, while the CAC 40 in Paris advanced nearly 0.5% to 5,828, despite a second day of nation-wide strikes protesting President Emmanuel Macron's plans to redesign the national retirement system. Germany's DAX picked up 0.3% to 13,092. 
Wall Street looked set to open higher, with the future contracts for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each gaining 0.3%. 
Investors are hoping that the U.S. and China will reach a trade deal before new U.S. tariffs go into effect Dec. 15 on some popular products made in China, including smartphones and laptops. 
“Whether or not U.S.-China can cut a deal remains the obsession; arguably the only game in town heading into ahead of the 15-Dec deadline for the next round of tariffs fall due,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. 
Chinese officials said Thursday that hinges on whether the U.S. will agree to roll back some of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump after he began his effort to win trade concessions from Beijing in mid-2018. 
“To be sure, there is still no clarity on the deal. But soothing remarks on ‘progress’ from those involved in the talks appears to have infused some hope and cut tensions,” the Mizuho report said. 
In Asian trading, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.1% to 26,498.37, while the Nikkei 225 in Japan picked up 0.2% to 23,354.40. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.0% to 2,081.85, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 2,912.01. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 gained 0.4% to 6,707.00. Shares fell in India, where the Sensex lost 0.8%. 
Investors will be looking for clues into the state of the U.S. economy from the Labor Department’s November tally of hiring by nonfarm employers, to be released later Friday. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.6%. 
Benchmark crude oil fell 36 cents to $58.07 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as investors expected the OPEC countries and some allies, including Russia, to cut production. Brent crude oil, the international standard, lost 22 cents to $63.17 a barrel.

Southwest to share Boeing settlement with workers,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/southwest-share-125m-boeing-settlement-workers-67683223,"DALLAS -- 
Southwest Airlines will share about $125 million with its employees after reaching a partial settlement with Boeing over damages from the grounding of the airplane maker's 737 Max.
But the president of the pilots union at Southwest says that the amount doesn't fairly compensate employees for wages they've lost from flights being canceled due to the grounding.
Southwest, which had about 59,000 employees at the start of the year, said Thursday that the settlement covers only a portion of its projected damages from the Max grounding. It declined to provide more details on its ongoing negotiations with Boeing.
The Dallas carrier has been among the hardest hit by the grounding of the Max in March after a pair of deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Without the planes, Southwest has been canceling about 175 flights each weekday. Southwest had 34 Max planes when they were grounded and expected more to be delivered this year.
Southwest reported in October that the grounding had cost it $435 million in operating income during the first nine months of the year. 
Earlier this month, the airline pushed back the expected return date for the troubled aircraft until at least March 6. Pilots union officials believe it will be at least April before Southwest puts passengers on the Max.
The airline said Thursday that money given to employees will be funded as part of its annual 2019 profit sharing distribution next year.
Boeing spokesman Peter Pedraza said the company won't comment on discussions with individual customers, “but we are working closely with all of them to support them through this difficult time.”
Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said his group appreciates that Boeing has acknowledged the need to compensate Southwest workers.
“However, this agreement doesn't get anywhere close to compensating the very real and significant losses SWAPA plots and other employees have experienced and continue to experience as a result of Boeing's negligence and fraud,” Weaks said.
The union has criticized Boeing for not telling pilots about a new flight-control system that was on the Max and played a role in the crashes.
Weaks said the union will push ahead with a lawsuit it filed against Boeing in October in federal district court in Dallas. The union said then that its members had lost more than $100 million in wages. 
Southwest is among the first airlines to announce at least a partial settlement with Boeing. In September, Icelandair said it had an agreement covering its six grounded planes, but it did not disclose details.
In July, Chicago-based Boeing took a pretax charge of $5.6 billion to cover Max-related compensation, which could be cash or other considerations such as discounts on services over the next several years. "
Q&A: Does a manufacturing slump threaten the US economy?,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/qa-manufacturing-slump-threaten-us-economy-67566477,"
Defying fears and predictions, the U.S. economy is still shrugging off President Donald Trump’s trade conflicts.
Employers added a sizzling 266,000 jobs in November, and unemployment matched a 50-year low of 3.5% — all while the Trump administration is waging a bruising trade war with China while fighting other trading partners, too.
Yet the economy has hardly been unscathed. Farmers are suffering. Manufacturers are mired in a slump. Business investment is down because managers don't know when — or whether — the trade hostilities, with their vast web of import taxes, will end.
What's more, a new round of Trump tariffs — import taxes on $160 billion more in Chinese goods — is set to hit Dec. 15. Those tariffs would strike directly at American consumers, who are driving the economic expansion and have so far been largely spared the worst of the pain from Trump’s trade fights.
Can the U.S. economy, which has grown steadily if tepidly for over a decade — the longest expansion on record — withstand the manufacturing slump and the Trump trade war?
Here are some questions and answers:
————
HOW HAS THE US ECONOMY WEATHERED THE THREATS?
So far, the U.S. impact of Trump’s trade wars has been confined largely to farms and factories. And trade, farming and manufacturing constitute a surprisingly small portion of the American economy.
Exports and imports account for just 27% of America's gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of economic output. Only in Nigeria, Cuba, Burundi and Sudan does trade represent a smaller share of GDP than in the United States, according to the World Bank.
American farmers have been punished by other countries’ retaliatory tariffs, notably from China’s taxes on American soybeans. So far this year, U.S. farm exports are down 4%. Yet farming accounts for a scant 0.6% of GDP.
Factories have been damaged too, because Trump’s tariffs have elevated the prices that manufacturers must pay for imported parts. And the retaliatory tariffs that China and other U.S. trading partners have imposed on U.S. exports have reduced America's access to foreign markets.
But because factory output represents only a small piece of the U.S. economy, the pain has so far remained contained. Manufacturing supplies 8% of American jobs, down from a peak 32% in 1953. And it produces just 11% of GDP, compared with a high of 28%, also in 1953.
Manufacturing “used to be a leading indicator’’ for the rest of the economy, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton. “It is different than it was.’’ 
Unless the trade hostilities escalate, most economists expect the U.S. economy as a whole to withstand the damage and keep growing, however modestly.
————
HOW ARE U.S. MANUFACTURERS HOLDING UP?
They’re clearly struggling. According to the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index, factory output has fallen for four straight months. The November reading failed to meet even low expectations. New orders, production and export orders all sank.
Factory hiring has slowed, too. Last year, manufacturers added an average of 22,000 jobs a month, the strongest pace since 1997. This year so far? A meager 5,100 a month. (In November, manufacturers did add 54,000 jobs, but virtually all of that gain came from General Motors employees returning to work after a strike ended in October.)
The Trump administration's trade conflicts account for much of the manufacturing sector’s woes. Trump’s aggressive and mercurial deployment of tariffs has paralyzed business investment, which fell in the April-June and July-September quarters after having surged in 2018 and early this year. Managers don’t know when the tariffs will end, whether they’ll escalate or which countries Trump might hit next. Many manufacturers have suspended decisions on where to situate factories, choose suppliers or pursue sales until more predictability returns to global commerce.
A broader global economic slowdown, related partly but not entirely to the trade conflicts, is contributing to the downturn in manufacturing.
————
COULD THE MANUFACTURING SLUMP AFFECT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?
No area of the country will be more crucial to the election outcome than the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where the manufacturing sector remains a major employer but has shed jobs. Trump scored razor-thin 2016 victories in all three states after vowing to restore the health of factories there.
Democrats are hopeful that the ailing manufacturing sector will help them win back some of the white working-class voters who backed Trump in 2016. But voting patterns in the Trump era can be hard to predict. The president is already casting his prospective Democratic opponents as left-wing radicals who would be poor stewards of America’s manufacturing base.
And polling suggests that voter opinions about Trump are not as connected to his leadership on the economy as has been the case with past presidents. 
——
WHAT NEXT?
The business world is waiting to see if Trump proceeds on Dec. 15 with plans to impose tariffs on an additional $160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything China ships to the United States.
Those tariffs would bring the trade war home to American consumers, whose spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity. The first tariffs on Chinese goods, begun last year, were designed to largely spare ordinary households. They affected mainly industrial products. By contrast, the Dec. 15 tariffs would hit toys, smartphones and other electronics and would likely lead many retailers to raise prices for consumers.
Services industries like retail are starting to look vulnerable. Though it continues to signal growth, ISM’s services index has weakened substantially over the past year.
“The trade war is beginning to metastasize to the service-side of the economy,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
It's entirely possible that consumers could soon enjoy a reprieve. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are trying to finish work on a modest preliminary trade agreement. And Trump might agree to cancel or postpone the Dec. 15 tariffs if they do.
But even a so-called Phase 1 deal would hardly resolve the U.S.-China conflict. The world’s two largest economies must still confront the thorniest issues dividing them: Widespread allegations that Beijing steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizes Chinese companies.
“It is critical that the president come to some arrangement with China,” Zandi said. “If instead the president escalates the war, the economic damage will become serious and recession next year likely.’’

Peace in sight? Paris summit seeks solution for Ukraine war,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/peace-sight-paris-summit-seeks-solution-ukraine-war-67596812,"
President Vladimir Putin of Russia met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine for the first time Monday at a summit in Paris to try to end five years of war between Ukrainian troops and Moscow-backed separatists. 
Both sat down at the French presidential palace along with the leaders of France and Germany for talks focused on reviving a 2015 peace agreement for eastern Ukraine that has largely stalled. Since 2014, the war has killed 14,000 people, emboldened the Kremlin and reshaped European geopolitics.
A major breakthrough is unlikely, and Ukrainian protesters in Kyiv are heaping pressure on their new leader not to surrender too much to Putin, who has been in office nearly 20 years.
But the fact that Putin and Zelenskiy met at all was a significant step after years of war. Putin and Zelenskiy faced each other across the table, flanked by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Putin and Zelenskiy later held a separate one-on-one meeting later, the Kremlin said.
Whatever happens, the summit is the         biggest test yet for Zelenskiy, a comic actor and political novice who won the presidency this year in a landslide -- partly on promises to end the war.
The 2015 peace agreement helped to reduce the intensity of the fighting but Ukrainian soldiers and Russia-backed separatists have continued to exchange fire across World War I-style trenches along a         front line that slices through eastern Ukraine.
While Zelenskiy still enjoys broad public support, he has been          embarrassed by the scandal around his discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump that have unleashed an impeachment inquiry in Washington. The U.S. is an important military backer for Ukraine, which is hugely out-gunned by Russia.
While the U.S. was never part of this peace process, U.S. backing has strengthened Ukraine's overall negotiating position with Russia in the past. Now that support is increasingly in doubt, after the Trump administration froze military aid earlier this year and is increasingly focused on Trump's re-election bid. With U.S. influence waning around the world, many in Kyiv see one clear winner: Russia.
Some Ukrainians fear Zelenskiy will be out-maneuvered by Putin Several thousand protesters rallied in the Ukrainian capital Sunday to urge Zelenskiy not to make any concessions to Russia, and 100 opposition activists set up a tent camp outside his office with banners reading “No to capitulation!”
“Russia started the war, and any negotiations with the aggressor elicit our suspicion and vigilance, especially when we’re being forced into peace on Russian terms,” said 21-year-old student Igor Derbunov, 
In front of the French presidential palace, two protesters from the feminist group Femen, which originated in Ukraine, bared their breasts and shouted “Stop Putin Now!” They were quickly whisked away by police.
Russia wants to use the summit to increase pressure on Zelenskiy to fulfill the 2015 Minsk peace accord, which promises wide autonomy to Ukraine's rebel-held regions.
Zelenskiy wants to tweak the timeline laid out in the Minsk accord, which calls for Ukraine to be able to regain control of its border with Russia only after local elections are held in the separatist regions and the regions receive autonomous status. Zelenskiy says Ukraine must get control of its border first before local elections are held, but the Kremlin insists that’s not an option.
French officials say potential changes to the timeline will be discussed but stressed the summit is aimed at fulfilling the Minsk accord, not writing a new peace deal.
Germany and France helped to broker the Minsk accord, in hopes of ending a conflict on Europe’s eastern edge that has complicated relations with Russia, a powerful trading partner and diplomatic player. 
But with progress stalled, the leaders haven’t met since 2016. Monday’s summit is the first involving Zelenskiy and Macron, who has sought to improve relations with Russia.
To pave the way for the talks in Paris, Ukraine and Russia struck a prisoner exchange deal in September and agreed on a troop and heavy weapons pullback from two locations in eastern Ukraine. Russia has also released three Ukrainian navy ships that were seized a year ago. 
Zelenskiy said he hopes they will help achieve a lasting cease-fire and a deal to exchange all prisoners held by the warring parties.
Russia denies providing troops and weapons to help the separatists, but has maintained political support and sent aid. It argues that people in eastern Ukraine feel stronger cultural and linguistic ties with Russia than with Western-leaning Kyiv.
Civilians in the war-ravaged region feel trapped amid regular exchanges of fire and the region's economic meltdown.
Antonina, a resident of the village of Mariinka near the front line, spoke with anguish about the endless conflict. 
“People do not understand what is going on here in reality, what we are feeling and living through,"" she said, refusing to give her last name for personal security reasons. ""Nobody is asking for our opinion, nobody is interested in it and nobody pities us.”
Russia’s interior minister announced Monday that about 125,000 residents of rebel-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine have been given Russian passports since April. Putin issued a decree allowing residents of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions to apply for Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure. The move was condemned in Kyiv as the latest sign of Russian interference in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
The Kremlin hopes that an end to the conflict could also lead to the eventual lifting of EU sanctions against Russia linked to the fighting, which European businesses have pushed for. The EU and U.S. imposed separate sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
The EU is expected to extend sanctions this week by another six months. Arriving for meetings in Brussels on Monday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: “At the moment I see no grounds to change anything in the European Union’s sanctions policy toward Russia in this matter. It would be good if we could get there at some point.”

New drugs show rare promise against advanced breast cancer,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/drugs-show-rare-promise-advanced-breast-cancer-67656797,"SAN ANTONIO -- 
Doctors on Wednesday reported unusually good results from tests of two experimental drugs in women with an aggressive form of breast cancer that had spread widely and resisted many previous treatments. 
One drug showed particular ability to reach tumors in the brain, which are notoriously tough to treat. 
The other pairs a sort of homing device for cancer cells with a payload of chemotherapy that's released when it reaches its target.
""It's a guided missile. It's able to bring the chemotherapy directly to the cancer cell,"" said the study leader, Dr. Ian Krop of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
Results were disclosed at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and in the New England Journal of Medicine.
From 15% to 20% of breast cancers are ""HER2-positive"" — they have too much of a protein called HER2 on their cell surfaces, driven by an overactive gene that promotes cancer growth.
Krop led a study of 253 such women to test the guided missile drug, called T-DXd, given as an infusion every three weeks. These women had tried on average six previous treatments before the experimental drug. Different doses were tested, and 184 women got what turned out to be the best one. Among those women, 61% saw their tumors shrink at least 30%. In 6% of them, no signs of cancer were seen in at least two followup scans.
Although the experimental drug was not tested against others, the response rate is three to four times better than what's usually seen in this situation, Krop said. The median time until cancer worsened was 16 months, and to see anything hold such serious cancers at bay for more than a year is exciting, he said.
Side effects were substantial, though. About 60% of women had low blood counts, nausea, anemia or fatigue, and 15% stopped treatment because of them. Most serious: Twenty-five developed lung inflammation, and four died of it. This is a rare side effect with other drugs for this type of cancer, but it was much more common with the experimental drug. Doctors can watch patients closely and give anti-inflammatory medicines if it occurs, Krop said. 
Because these cancers generally prove fatal, the drug ""is still beneficial for most patients,"" he said.
An independent expert, Dr. Jennifer Litton of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said it may be possible to give patients preventative anti-inflammatory medicines. It's worth the risk because the drug's benefit is so great, she said.
The study was sponsored by the drug's developers, Daiichi Sankyo Inc. and AstraZeneca, and they are seeking approval for the medicine in the U.S., Japan and Europe. Krop consults for the companies.
Dana-Farber's Dr. Eric Winer helped lead a study of the other experimental medicine — tucatinib, from Seattle Genetics. 
""It's a drug that's particularly able to get into the brain,"" he said, and half of the 612 participants had cancer that had spread there.
""These patients had nothing"" that worked, and they're often excluded from tests of new drugs because their outlook is so poor, Litton said.
All were given usual treatments — Herceptin and the chemo drug Xeloda — plus tucatinib or dummy pills.
After two years, 45% of those on tucatinib were alive versus 27% of the others. Among the women whose cancer had spread to the brain, one quarter were alive with no worsening of those tumors a year later. None of the women in the comparison group achieved that.
Diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and some liver side effects were a little more common with tucatinib. About 6% of the tucatinib group stopped treatment because of side effects versus 3% of the others.
Litton said she put some patients on studies of the drug ""and they did really well."" 
Seattle Genetics sponsored the study and Winer and others consult for the company.

US feels the heat as Trump pulls out of global climate pact,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-feels-heat-trump-pulls-global-climate-pact-67495853,"
President Donald Trump is aiming to make the annual U.N.-sponsored climate talks underway in Madrid the last ones for full participation by the United States, which is the world's No. 1 economy and the second-biggest carbon emitter.
Trump dismisses climate change and he thumbed his nose at previous climate talks by twice sending White House delegations to promote climate-degrading coal. He is due to complete the U.S. withdrawal from the landmark Paris global climate accord on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after next year's U.S. presidential election. If Trump loses that election, the next president could put the brakes on the withdrawal.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other political and business leaders, scientists and activists are traveling to Spain this week and next to drive home a counter message: U.S. cities, states and businesses representing a sizable chunk of the U.S. population and economy are committed to a global effort to slash emissions.
“We’re still in it,” Pelosi told reporters at the talks, where she appeared with 14 other congressional Democrats on Monday to call climate change a growing threat to public health, economy and national security in the U.S..
Her comments were echoed by Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin's lieutenant governor.
“Regardless of whether or not we have the support of the nation’s highest office or not, this work is going to get done,” Barnes said.
This year's conference is expected to focus on fine-tuning the rules for reducing fossil fuel emissions by the roughly 200 signatories of the Paris agreement. It comes ahead of a big push at next year's climate summit for more ambitious emissions-cutting targets.
Experts say the United States' repeated about-faces on the threat of climate change likely have done lasting damage.
Even before Trump repudiated the deal backed by President Barack Obama, George W. Bush’s administration renounced the landmark Kyoto emissions protocol, negotiated in the late 1990s during Bill Clinton’s presidency, said Nigel Purvis, a State Department climate negotiator under Clinton and Bush.
“The international community has concluded the United States is an unreliable partner,” Purvis said.
Although the United States served formal notice last month that it intends to become the first country to withdraw from the Paris accord, it technically remains a participant until next Nov. 4.
Marcia Bernicat, a senior State Department official, is leading the official U.S. delegation.
The administration is taking part to ensure a level playing field that protects U.S. interests,” the State Department said in a statement.
Advocates of the Paris accord say the U.S. withdrawal will leave American businesses to compete internationally under carbon-cutting rules set by other countries. 
Behind the scenes, U.S. diplomats have played a helpful role despite the planned U.S. withdrawal, pushing for transparency and solid rules as countries commit to specific targets for cutting emissions, delegates from other nations say privately.
Publicly, Trump has catered to his base at the yearly talks. That includes dispatching a team to the 2017 and 2018 climate meetings to stage side events promoting coal-fired power production, one of the main sources of climate-wrecking emissions. 
His administration stood by fossil fuels “unapologetically,” White House energy envoy Wells Griffith said at the U.S. pro-fossil fuel event at last year’s talks in Poland. That drew chants from the audience of “Shame on you!” 
Griffith, who helped broker a coal deal in Ukraine, apparently refused a request by House impeachment investigators to discuss administration actions there. A woman who answered the phone at Griffith''s office Tuesday said no one there would say whether he planned to appear this year's climate negotiations.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month repeated Trump's argument that the Paris accord was an economic burden for the United States. Pompeo said technological innovation and the free market have made for continued U.S. declines in climate-changing emissions.
It's true U.S. carbon emissions are still falling under Trump, according to a study by Global Carbon Project, a group of international scientists who track emissions. 
The United States saw emissions drop 1.7% from 2018 to 2019, the same decline as in the European Union, even as China led in a 0.6% rise in emissions globally over the last year, the study said. 
U.S. experts say the drop in U.S. fossil fuel emissions is due in part to the decline of coal-fired power plants, losers in marketplace competition against cheaper natural gas and renewable sources despite Trump's 2016 campaign pledges to save coal.
The 2018 midterm elections, which gave Democrats control of the House, showed that embracing top-down government action to cut fossil fuel emissions can be part of a winning platform, at least in some parts of the country.
In August 2017, 46% of Americans opposed U.S. withdrawal from the international agreement, while 29% supported it, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. 
This August, another AP-NORC poll found nearly two-thirds of Americans said the federal government should bear a lot of responsibility for combating climate change. 
""We hope ... this is only a temporary farewell"" for the U.S., German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said last month at a diplomatic conference.
Regardless, he said, other governments can't count on Americans sorting out a lasting climate policy anytime soon. 
Ultimately, said Carla Frisch, a former energy policy expert at the Department of Energy under three U.S. administrations, U.S. climate action demands U.S. climate regulation, making cutting emissions the law and policy of the land.
“We have to be all in,” Frisch said. ""We also need the federal government, to get where we need to go.""""

"Ex-Fed Chair Volcker dies, tamed inflation with recession",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/fed-chair-volcker-dies-tamed-inflation-recession-67603525,"
Paul Volcker, who as Federal Reserve chairman in the early 1980s elevated interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double-digit inflation, has died, according to his office.
He was 92. 
Volcker took charge of the Fed in August 1979, when the U.S. economy was in the grip of runaway inflation. Consumer prices skyrocketed 13% in 1979 and then by the same pace again in 1980.
Working relentlessly to bring prices under control, Volcker raised the Fed’s benchmark interest rate from 11% to a record 20% by late 1980 to try to slow the economy’s growth and thereby shrink inflation.
Those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily. By January 1980, a recession had begun. It lasted six months. A deeper and more painful downturn took hold in July 1981. It endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10.8% in November and December 1982, the highest level since the Great Depression. 
In a statement Monday, former President Jimmy Carter, who had chosen Volcker to be Fed chairman, called him a “giant of public service.""
“Paul was as stubborn as he was tall, and although some of his policies as Fed chairman were politically costly, they were the right thing to do,” Carter said. 
In the early 1980s, Volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway price increases. Home builders put postage stamps on bricks and on 2-by-4 wooden planks and mailed them to the Fed to protest how super-high interest rates had wrecked their businesses. 
Auto dealers, stuck with lots full of unsold cars, did the same with car keys. Angry farmers, struggling with high debts, drove their tractors to Washington and blockaded the Fed’s headquarters. 
One of the mailed 2-by-4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the Fed: David Wilcox, a young staffer under Volcker who later rose to direct the Fed's research and statistics division, said he received one of the 2-by-4s from Larry Slifman, a former senior economist in the division, and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year. Wilcox said he held onto it “as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again, creating the need for someone like Volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did.”
David Jones, an economist and author of several books on the Fed, ranks Volcker above all other chairmen since World War II. 
“Volcker was transformative in terms of Fed policy,"" Jones said. “We are still enjoying the benefits of his success.""
By sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition, Volcker implicitly asserted the Fed's independence from political and public interference. Throughout its history, the Fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. In the past three years, President Donald Trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the Fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively.
Once inflation was subdued, Volcker himself was privately pressured by President Ronald Reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted. James Baker, Treasury secretary during Reagan's second term in the late 1980s, chose supporters of lower rates to the Fed's governing board. This led to Volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986, though his opponents backed down. News reports at the time said Volcker had threatened to resign. 
“I had no doubt in my mind that Baker wanted to surround me with his appointees,” Volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the Fed. 
The pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results: Inflation receded. Once it did, Volcker’s Fed began lowering interest rates. And the economy rebounded vigorously enough for President Ronald Reagan to declare the arrival of “Morning in America’’ on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election. Volcker left the Fed in 1987, succeeded by Alan Greenspan. 
The Volcker-led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the “Great Moderation’’ — more than two decades of mostly steady economic growth, relatively low unemployment and modest price increases. The Great Moderation ended with the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
Volcker had spent most of his career in the public sector — at the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Fed board in Washington. 
A towering 6 foot 7 and perpetually rumpled, Volcker favored cheap cigars and bad suits. John Connally, a slick Texan who was Volcker’s boss at the Treasury in the early 1970s, once threatened to fire him if he didn’t get a haircut and improve his wardrobe. 
Despite his personal austerity, Volcker served in lucrative positions on Wall Street in between his stints in public service, including an early career at Chase Manhattan bank. He was chair of Wolfensohn & Co., an investment firm, from 1988 to 1996.
After leaving the Fed, Volcker took on assignments as a troubleshooter. He ran a commission to investigate what Swiss banks did with the assets of Holocaust victims during and after World War II. The United Nations assigned him to look into allegations of corruption in a UN program to provide food aid to Iraq. 
Volcker, who was born in Cape May, New Jersey, on Sept. 5, 1927. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a master's from Harvard. In 1951, he spent a year at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Foundation Fellow. 
His survivors include his second wife, Anke Dening, and two children.
After the financial crisis of 2008, President Barack Obama recruited Volcker as an economic adviser. In that role, Volcker pressed for restrictions on banks’ ability to trade in financial markets with their own money, rather than their clients’, and to invest in private equity and hedge funds. 
The regulations, known as the “Volcker Rule,’’ were included in a far-reaching financial overhaul bill Congress passed in 2010. Volcker had little sympathy for big banks in the wake of the financial crisis, which required a taxpayer bailout of big Wall Street firms. He dismissed claims that deregulated financial institutions deserved credit for coming up with innovative products and services. 
The only useful financial innovation he’d seen in years, he said, was the ATM.

"Trump, Dems in tentative deal on North American trade pact",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-dems-tentative-deal-north-american-trade-pact-67601913,"
House Democrats have reached a tentative agreement with labor leaders and the White House over a rewrite of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal that has been a top priority for         President Donald Trump.
“I’m hearing very good things, including from unions and others that it’s looking good. I hope they put it up to a vote, and if they put it up to a vote, it’s going to pass,"" Trump said Monday. “I’m hearing a lot of strides have been made over the last 24 hours, with unions and others.""
“We’re close. We’re not quite finished yet. We’re within range,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday night. She briefed lawmakers on the negotiations earlier in the evening and said more meetings would follow Tuesday.
“We’re at a moment of truth,"" Pelosi said.
The tentative accord was revealed by a Democratic aide not authorized to discuss the talks and granted anonymity because the agreement is not official.
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., credited Pelosi for building consensus among Democrats for the looming agreement, which could be announced as early as Tuesday. 
Details still need to be finalized and the U.S. Trade Representative will need to submit the implementing legislation to Congress. No vote has been scheduled. 
The trade agreement is one item of many of the congressional to-do list, including a government-wide funding package and an annual defense policy measure that has been broadened to include a new 12-week parental leave benefit for federal employees.
“We're trying to move everything along. We have a lot to do before we leave,” Pelosi said as she left the Capitol Monday. “And appropriations is the central thing.""
The new, long-sought trade agreement with Mexico and Canada would give both Trump and his top adversary, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a major accomplishment despite the turmoil of         his likely impeachment.     
The new trade pact would replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers involving the United States, Mexico and Canada. Critics, including Trump, labor unions and many Democratic lawmakers, branded NAFTA a job killer for America because it encouraged factories to move south of the border, capitalize on low-wage Mexican workers and ship products back to the U.S. duty free.
Weeks of back-and-forth, closely monitored by Democratic labor allies such as the AFL-CIO, have brought the two sides together. Pelosi is a longtime free trade advocate and supported the original NAFTA in 1994. Trump has accused Pelosi of being incapable of passing the agreement because she is too wrapped up in impeachment.
Democrats from swing districts have agitated for finishing the accord, in part to demonstrate some accomplishments for their majority. 
By ratifying the agreement, Congress could lift uncertainty over the future of U.S. commerce with its No. 2 (Canada) and No. 3 (Mexico) trading partners last year and perhaps give the U.S. economy a modest boost. U.S. farmers are especially eager to make sure their exports to Canada and Mexico continue uninterrupted.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke on the phone with Trump on Monday about the progress being made. Trudeau’s office said they will stay in touch “through the final stages of the negotiations.”
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last year negotiated the replacement agreement with Canada and Mexico. But the new USMCA accord required congressional approval and input from top Democrats like Pelosi and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who have been engaged in lengthy, detailed negotiations over enforcement provisions and other technical details. 
Republicans leaders and lawmakers have agitated for months for the accord but Pelosi has painstakingly worked to bring labor on board. Democrats see the pact as significantly better than NAFTA and an endorsement by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka could be the key to winning significant Democratic support.
The pact contains provisions designed to nudge manufacturing back to the United States. For example, it requires that 40% to 45% of cars eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least $16 an hour — that is, in the United States and Canada and not in Mexico.
The trade pact picked up some momentum after Mexico in April passed a labor-law overhaul required by USMCA. The reforms are meant to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and bargain for better pay and working conditions, narrowing the gap with the United States.
Mexico ratified USMCA in June and has budgeted more money later this year to provide the resources needed for enforcing the agreement."
"China waiving tariff hikes on US soybeans, pork",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-waiving-tariff-hikes-us-soybeans-pork-67539628,"
China is waiving punitive tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork while the two sides negotiate a trade deal, the Ministry of Finance said Friday.
Beijing promised in September to lift the tariffs, adding to conciliatory steps that raised hopes for a settlement. The government announced then that Chinese importers were placing orders but no details of when the tariff exemption would take effect were released.
China is “carrying out the exclusion,” the Ministry of Finance said on its website. The ministry and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for further information.
Negotiators are working on the details of a “Phase 1” agreement announced in October by President Donald Trump.
The two sides have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods, disrupting global trade and threatening to depress economic growth.
Another U.S. tariff hike on an additional $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Dec. 15.
Chinese spokespeople have expressed hope for a settlement “as soon as possible,” but Trump spooked global financial markets this week by saying he might be willing to wait until after the U.S. presidential election late next year.
A sticking point is Chinese insistence that Washington must roll back punitive tariffs as part of any deal.
A Chinese spokesman repeated Thursday that Beijing expects such a move in a “Phase 1” agreement."
Thunberg 'a bit surprised' to be Time Person of the Year,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-time-person-year-67655105,"MADRID -- 
Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honored Wednesday to be named Time’s youngest Person of the Year, while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade.
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone. 
""For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said on its         website.     
As she left a U.N. climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was “a bit surprised” at the recognition. 
“I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview.
“I'm of course, very grateful for that, very honored,” Thunberg said, but added: ""It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The “Greta effect” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said “are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.""
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation's president Tuesday. 
“Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,” Jair Bolsonaro said. “It's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,” he added, using the Portuguese word ”pirralha.""
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say “Pirralha.""
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change. 
On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the U.N.'s         annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren't going to stop the world's “climate emergency.”
“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren't enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
""This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.
“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. ""That, I think, is our biggest success.”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn't seem like it.”
“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added. 
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, had changed her.
""I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,"" she said.
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she's received from media and adoring fans.
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.
“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.
“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I've taken a gap year,” she said.
""I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,"" she added.
Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

Europe's new central banker aims to put her stamp on the job,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/europes-central-banker-aims-put-stamp-job-67688301,"FRANKFURT, Germany -- 
Christine Lagarde is wasting no time in putting her stamp on the  European Central Bank.
The bank's new president said at her first news conference Thursday that she will lead a top to bottom review of how  the institution sets monetary policy, looking at everything from how it defines success in fighting inflation to whether it can play a role financing the fight against global warming.
The policy review will ""turn each and every stone,” she said. She said the review would “take its time but not too much time,"" starting January and finishing by the end of 2020.
The ECB left unchanged the stimulus package that was decided under Draghi on Sept. 12. That put the focus on Lagarde and her plans on how to steer the powerful central bank whose decisions affect 342 million people in the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency. 
She is well known on the world stage from her previous jobs as French finance minister and then head of the International Monetary Fund, where she was deeply involved in efforts to rescue Greece and other indebted countries during the eurozone debt crisis. 
Those jobs, however, did not require her to give detailed views on the highly technical subject of monetary policy, where a misplaced word can jolt financial markets. She declined to fill in that blank extensively on Thursday, saying “”I'm neither a dove, nor a hawk"" — financial jargon for stimulus supporters and opponents — and that “my ambition is to be an owl,” implying the wisdom associated with that particular bird. 
She told journalists that she would have “my own style” in communicating with the financial community and not to compare her too much to her predecessors. She is the first woman to head the ECB and the fourth president since it was founded in 1998, following Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude Trichet and Draghi. 
Among the topics for the review could be how the bank defines its mission to keep prices  stable, given by the European Union. The ECB currently expresses that as keeping  annual inflation below, but close to 2%. The 2% goal is aimed at giving the economy a margin of safety to ward off deflation, a crippling downward price spiral that hit Japan in the 1990s. Some inflation encourages spending and investment. It  also makes it easier for indebted members of the eurozone to pay down debt and lower business costs. 
Inflation has remained stubbornly below the goal for years following the Great Recession and eurozone financial crisis of 2010-2012. Lagarde said a review was overdue since the last one occurred in 2003. 
The review would also look at what role the ECB could play in supporting financing for projects aimed at fighting climate change. The ECB has already bought some so-called green bonds, which finance projects aimed at reducing pollution and fighting global warming. It did not, however, buy them for environmental reasons but as part of its broad plan to purchase government and corporate bonds with the ultimate aim of easing credit conditions generally. 
The European Commission has announced a “green deal” aimed at lowering the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. The ECB's mandate says it must pursue price stability first but once that is taken care of it can look at supporting the general economic policies of the European Union. 
Lagarde said that recent economic indicators are weak overall but “point to some stabilizing in the slowdown of of economic growth.” The decision to keep interest rates low and unchanged followed a similar move this week by the U.S. Federal Reserve, where officials indicated they expect no change to rates through 2020. 
Doubts have grown among some economists about how much good more central bank stimulus can do to support developed economies. At the Fed, officials think the neutral interest rate, at which the bank's policies neither stimulate nor restrain economic activity, may be lower than in the past. 
At the ECB, officials enacted a stimulus package as recently as September, when they cut a key rate and launched a bond-buying program that pumps newly created money into the economy. Lagarde said that package would continue to support the economy with easier borrowing terms for companies. Draghi pushed the package through over objections from some members of the rate-setting council. That has given Lagarde a respite period that she can use to conduct the review. 
The economy in the eurozone is a mixed bag at the moment. The U.S.-China trade dispute has held back its manufacturing sector. Consumer demand and service companies have done better and that has helped lower unemployment. The ECB sees the eurozone growing 1.2% next year.
In September, the bank cut the deposit rate to minus 0.5% from minus 0.4%. The rate is charged on excess cash left at the central bank overnight by commercial banks, so the negative rate is in effect a penalty that aims to push banks to lend the money to companies. The bank also started 20 billion euros ($22 billion) in monthly purchases of government and corporate bonds."
Gannett: ‘Frontline’ reporting jobs will be last to get cut,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gannett-frontline-reporting-jobs-cut-67579489,"
In November, newspaper publisher GateHouse completed its acquisition of USA Today owner Gannett, creating the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S. Executives behind the merger, which was funded in part by a high-interest, $1.8 billion loan from a private equity firm, have pledged significant cost cuts, but say they are aiming to shield reporting jobs as much as possible.
The combined company, which will use the Gannett name, also has big aspirations for new digital ventures that it likens to a modern and reimagined form of classified advertising.
The Associated Press spoke recently with Gannett CEO Mike Reed and the head of its new operating unit, Paul Bascobert. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
Q: Tell us about new products you might launch.
Bascobert: If you go back to think about what a local newspaper was, even 20 years ago, you were provided with news and information. But you also had connections to the local community through classifieds, which connected you with local providers. You could find a dog or cat, personals, a car, etc. We think we can actually go back to that through better digital innovation.
Q: You have 140 million online visitors, but that digital business is small for each local paper.
Bascobert: We can use 140 million as a national advertising buy. What's more powerful is actually the market share within each of those little communities. The amount of digital activity on our platforms and the engagement, the frequency of people on our digital platforms is actually where the real opportunity is.
Q: How is the $300 million cost-cut estimate going to translate to job cuts?
Bascobert: There’s a lot of duplication of senior-level folks and duplication of management. There’s duplication of printing delivery. Not just people, but operating costs, systems costs, audit costs, things that we’re buying twice that we only need to buy once.
Q: What about the newsroom?
Bascobert: Formatting and layout, digital placements, digital research. There's lots of things that can be done in one place, which leaves us more resources to keep our frontline reporting intact. That's the thing that has given us the trust in the brand and these local markets that let us build the digital businesses on the back of it. It's the last place that we want to touch.
Q: Would you be able to hire reporters? 
Bascobert: If that's what we determined to be the right answer, sure. But I don't necessarily think that the answer is adding more bodies. There's a lot more interesting innovation to be done through things like use of large datasets.
Q: GateHouse, and now Gannett, is managed by private equity firm Fortress through 2021. There’s a lot of wariness of media companies connected to investment companies. What’s your response?
Bascobert: To make the transformation that we need to make, we need to invest in new products, new technology, new approaches. Those investments come from shareholders who do demand the return. You know, for lack of investment from companies, from shareholders, the business doesn't change. It just continues to decline.
Reed: I’m a 31-year media guy who cares deeply about the future of journalism. This is not an investment where I'm at the table saying we've got to cut these journalists because we've got to pay fees to somebody else. That's never a discussion that would be had."
Big investors up call for governments to take climate action,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/big-investors-call-governments-climate-action-67590674,"
More than 600 institutional investors  managing a whopping $37 trillion in client assets called Monday for governments to step up their efforts against climate change.
The investors, including banks, pension funds and insurance companies, directed their message to countries participating in a two-week U.N. climate conference in Madrid.
Firms such as Britain's Aviva, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Zurich Insurance Group demanded an end to thermal coal power plants worldwide, the introduction of a “meaningful” price on carbon, an end to fossil fuel subsidies and for governments to increase planned emissions cuts beyond what has already been pledged.
Similar appeals have been issued by investment companies before, but Monday’s is the biggest so far. The 631 companies involved held assets worth more than the GDP of the United States and China together last year.
Separately, a financial research group said major companies themselves can significantly cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouses gases by making their suppliers switch to renewable energy.
The London-based nonprofit group CDP said it analyzed data from thousands of firms that supply big corporations such as Walmart, Samsung and L’Oreal, concluding that shifting a fifth of their energy purchases to renewable sources like wind or solar could reduce emissions by 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide — or about the combined amount released by Brazil and Mexico in 2017."
Correction: Capricorn Studio Renaissance story,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/correction-capricorn-studio-renaissance-story-67527898,"
In a story Dec. 3 about Mercer Music at Capricorn, The Associated Press reported erroneously that one of the co-founders of Capricorn Records was Frank Fenton. It should have said his last name was Fenter, not Fenton.
A corrected version of the story is below:
Iconic Southern rock recording studio is revived in Georgia
The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn
By JEFF MARTIN
Associated Press
ATLANTA (AP) — The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn.
Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s.
Capricorn’s historic Studio A is reopening this week, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology.
“It’s a place that spawned a decade of remarkable creative activity,” Mercer President William Underwood said in an interview.
It also helped make Macon one of the nation’s music capitals. Underwood hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon’s place among cities that forged the music history of the United States — places like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans.
Macon’s civic leaders view Southern rock through a far different lens these days than in the 1970s.
Southern rockers and Southern Baptists traveled in different orbits back then. The Capricorn music scene — part of the drug-infused counterculture movement of the time — was not always welcome in conservative Middle Georgia.
Now, Capricorn and Southern rock are officially sanctioned by today’s leaders, many of whom were fans in their younger days. Underwood, for instance, grew up listening to Southern rock and considers The Allman Brothers Band “the greatest jam band ever.”
In planning the new music complex, Underwood and others visited music hubs including Nashville, where Elvis Presley and others recorded their hits in RCA’s Studio B.
“There are people all over the world who travel to see these restored studios,” said Larry Brumley, a senior vice president at Mercer.
Macon-area officials hope the restoration — funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors — will help spur downtown redevelopment.
The restored Macon studio is part of Mercer Music at Capricorn, a 20,000-square-foot (1,860-square-meter) complex that will include a museum. Among its goals: To train and inspire new musicians. To that end, the Capricorn Music Incubator will provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft.
The idea is “to be a place to bring talented, creative people together and have them interact and engage with one another,” Underwood said.
“One day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,” he said.
Redding’s voice became emblematic of Macon music six decades ago, after Mercer University student Phil Walden discovered his vocal talents while booking local bands for fraternity parties.
In 1969, Capricorn Records was formed by Walden and others, including Frank Fenter and producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.
“My father loved the South, he loved Georgia and he especially loved Macon,” Phil Walden’s daughter, Amantha, said at Tuesday’s dedication ceremony. “He loved Southern music deep inside his soul.”
“My father’s life mission was to show the world what the South was capable of, and today we are here to celebrate a chapter of that mission,” she added.
Walden, his brother Alan Walden and their business partners discovered new artists who went on to create what became Southern rock.
The Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie and others recorded songs inside the studio that was built for the Capricorn record label.
The Allman Brothers Band became so popular that they helped a former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election by performing at campaign events, Carter has said. Carter told Mercer graduates at their 2016 commencement that he might not have been elected if the band hadn’t “adopted” him.
“Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,” Carter said in 2017. “The band got the campaign political attention and raised much needed funds.”
When Underwood became Mercer’s president, the vacant offices that once housed Capricorn were a shambles, with one exception.
“The studio itself — that magical place where this great music was made — was still intact,” Underwood recalled. “It was kind of a miracle.”
A second venue, Studio B, will be used for larger-scale recordings and to host concerts and other special events. Film scores could be recorded there, tying into Georgia’s booming movie industry, Underwood said.
The studio will also feature a custom-built, 40-channel analog sound board that was created by the Maryland-based company API, he said.
Wes Griffith, who now manages the newly restored studio, recalls the first time he stepped inside.
“I was in awe, standing there where all these great things happened, all this great music was made,” Griffith said. “It’s just a dream come true for me to be the steward of that place and share that history and start a new beginning.”"
"Across generations, French workers fight pensions overhaul",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/french-workers-ready-long-strike-fight-pension-change-67485474,"
Amid the crowds demonstrating in Paris against a planned overhaul of the pension system, a nephew and his uncle will be marching side by side on the front row, a symbol of how anger at the changes is spanning generations.
Vincent Le Faucheur, 23, and Gilles Pierre, 41, both work for France’s railways and are ready to commit to an “unlimited strike” that could paralyze the economy for days, even weeks.
Le Faucheur, who joined the national railway company SNCF three years ago as a traffic controller, notes that previous generations secured the worker rights that he enjoys - and feels he needs defend.
“The older ones have fought for us. It’s normal we fight for ourselves and for the future generations,” he says. “Yes, it will be difficult, but if we need to do it, we will.”
Both are still years away from having to live off a pension, but Le Faucheur wants to show solidarity with his uncle, who has been a metro driver for the Paris public transport company RATP for 11 years.
They want the government to abandon its plans.
Under the current system, both have a special pension linked to their job and company, allowing Le Faucheur to retire at a minimum age of 57 and his uncle at 52.
With the proposal, Macron’s government wants to apply one set of rules to all new pensioners, saying it will make the system fairer and simpler. It would replace the current 42 pension regimes that apply to various professions and can include specific provisions, like early retirement for train workers. All French retirees receive a state pension. The overall legal retirement age is 62.
The industrial action illustrates the mounting fears across generations that people will have to work longer for less.
Thursday’s strikes are expected to snarl transport, with trains remaining in their depots and flights delayed or cancelled. Thousands of schools will be closed, and garbage may not be collected as many workers, mostly from the public sector, have joined the movement.
Some public hospital workers will go to the Paris march and police unions are calling for a symbolic protest, too.
Both Pierre and Le Faucheur concede that their current pension arrangements are favorable, but they argue that it’s fair compensation for the many constraints that go with their jobs, like working on weekends and holidays.
Pierre, a member of the left-wing Solidaires union, feels very attached to France’s history of social rights.
“The five weeks of paid vacation, the social security, we got all that through social struggles from people who sacrificed themselves financially for us to get that,” he said.
Retiring later, he said, likely means retiring with health problems.
“What do we want for our retirement years? To enjoy it or being a retiree in a hospital or in a bed and not being able to enjoy life?”
The upcoming strikes are the latest in a long line of protests since Macron came to power in 2017. Most center on changes to the labor market, which Macron insisted during his election were necessary for France to become a more dynamic economy.
The worry for Macron’s government is that the strikes could re-ignite the yellow vest protests, which erupted in November 2018 and quickly turned into a broader movement for more economic and social justice and were against Macron’s policies seen as favoring the rich.
Pierre feels a sense of solidarity with the yellow vests, some of whom are expected to join the protests.
“There’s a growing social gap between the poorest and the richest,” he said. “There are more and more retirees who can’t make it at the end of the month.”
French political scientist Dominique Andolfatto said the planned reforms concern everyone and that the government has not communicated its intentions clearly. Details on the pensions won’t be known until the bill is presented next year.
As a result, he said the planned reforms have “created anxiety within the population.”
Le Faucheur and Pierre say they understand the hurdles they face.
“I have concerns because I know this reform for Macron is the priority of his term”, Pierre said. “But on the other hand, I think that the French now are aware we need to join together in solidarity.”"
OPEC nations grapple with oversupply of oil,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/opec-nations-grapple-oversupply-oil-67485052,"
The world may be heading for an even greater oversupply of oil, and that possibility — which could drive down fuel and energy prices — is hanging over members of the OPEC cartel as they head into negotiations Thursday. 
The oil-producing nations will decide whether to stick with production cuts they’ve endured for the past three years, relax them or deepen them in the hopes of propping up prices. 
They’re negotiating through a tangle of tensions driving members in competing directions. 
Saudi Aramco’s         stock market debut, which is expected Friday, has put Saudi Arabia in a precarious position as it bets on what volume of oil production will hit a sweet spot for prices, with the added pressure of considering the interests of the state-run oil giant’s shareholders. The nation is already bearing the burden of the largest share of OPEC’s production cuts. 
But some nations such as Iraq have been ignoring the agreement and producing more than their allotted amount. 
“If people are already not complying to the current agreement, what’s the point to those that are complying cutting more? So the others can go on cheating?” said Bhushan Bahree, executive director of global oil at research group IHS Markit. “I think the Saudi position is they’re willing to cut more if needed, but they want better compliance.” 
Brent crude oil hovered around $61 per barrel Wednesday afternoon. Prices have fluctuated throughout the year, reaching nearly $75 per barrel in April after U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela limited world supply, but lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China dampened economic expectations, pushing prices back down. 
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was trading at around $56 Wednesday afternoon, and its price followed a similar trajectory throughout the year. 
As it stands, OPEC nations have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March 2020, and most analysts expect OPEC nations to extend those production cuts until at least summer. 
“If they just keep the existing situation, then you get this massive oversupply,” said Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. 
Rousseau believes OPEC nations will cut production by an additional 400,000 barrels per day to keep supply and demand in balance during the first half of next year, with the cuts made mainly by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But substantial cuts may be difficult to achieve with some OPEC members following their own agendas. 
“Iraq has exceeded its production target every month this year,” Rousseau said. “Granted, there’s some unrest going on in the country, but I don’t think they’ll voluntarily reduce.” 
Meanwhile, Russia, which is not part of OPEC but has been following its lead on production limits in recent years, has indicated it wants its oil production re-calculated in a way that’s in line with OPEC nations. That could enable it to produce more oil. 
And even if members of the cartel cut production, there’s more oil coming online from non-OPEC nations including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana, which will more than make up for any drop in production, according to IHS Markit. 
The dynamic to watch will be whether Russia and Saudi Arabia will come to an agreement on production levels in the early and middle parts of next year, said Heather Heldman, managing partner at Luminae Group, a geopolitical intelligence firm. 
“If something goes awry with Saudi production in the next few months, and there’s a fairly good chance something will happen ... Russia’s going to be the first party looking to fill that gap,” Heldman said. “And I think the Saudis know that.”"
Global stocks turn higher on renewed trade hopes,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-stocks-follow-wall-street-lower-trade-worries-67483219,"
Global stock markets turned higher on Wednesday on hopes that negotiations toward a U.S.-China trade deal are proceeding despite tough rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Sentiment improved during European trading hours, with indexes and Wall Street futures pushing higher.
Trump said Tuesday that he has ""no deadline"" for a trade deal and doesn’t mind waiting until after next year’s presidential election to make one. While that pushed markets down, a subsequent report from Bloomberg News cited officials saying that the two sides are inching closer to a deal.
Investors hope for at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.
Tensions flared last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.
“The trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks,” said DBS Group analysts in a report.
Germany’s DAX rose 1.1% to 13,125 while London’s FTSE 100 was steady at 7,151. France’s CAC 40 advanced 1.2% to 5,795.
On Wall Street, futures for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.5% higher.
Negotiators have yet to agree on details of an interim deal Trump has called ""Phase 1.""
Investors also are weighing the potential for additional trade disputes.
On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.
Earlier, in Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.1% to close at 23,135.23 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gave up 1.3% to 26,062.56.
The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.2% to 2,878.13 and Seoul’s Kospi declined 0.7% to 2,068.89. Australia’s S&P-ASX 200 fell 1.6% to 6,606.50 and India’s Sensex lost 0.2% to 40,578.93.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 95 cents to $57.05 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 14 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.13 to $61.95 per barrel in London. It lost 10 cents the previous session.

PG&E's stock surges 16% on tentative wildfire settlement,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pge-corp-stock-surges-settlement-67605612,"
PG&E's stock surged Monday after the utility reached a tentative $13.5 billion settlement resolving all major claims related to the Northern California wildfires of 2017 and 2018.
The fires were blamed on Pacific Gas and Electric's outdated equipment and negligence. The utility said Friday that the deal is a key step toward its exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It still needs court approval.
The agreement is expected to resolve all claims arising from a series of 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise. It also resolves claims from the 2015 Butte Fire and Oakland’s 2016 Ghost Ship Fire.
PG&E said the proposed settlement is the third it has reached as it works through its Chapter 11 case. The utility previously reached a $1 billion settlement with cities, counties and other public utilities and an $11 billion agreement with insurance companies and other entities that have paid claims relating to the fires.
Shares in San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. closed Monday trading up $1.53, or 16%, at $11.18. The stock is still down 53% for the year."
Iran says it killed ‘rioters’ in deadliest unrest in decades,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/iran-killed-rioters-deadliest-unrest-decades-67465356,"
Iran acknowledged for the first time Tuesday that its security forces shot and killed protesters across the country to put down demonstrations last month over the sharply spiking price of gasoline, the deadliest unrest to hit the country since the turmoil of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A report by Iranian state television sought to portray those killed as “rioters” or foreign-backed insurgents who threatened military posts, oil tanks and the public. It acknowledged that the violence also killed passers-by, security forces and peaceful protesters without assigning blame.
However, online videos of demonstrations purport to show security forces firing machine guns and rifles at crowds. Amnesty International believes the unrest beginning in mid-November and crackdown that followed killed at least 208 people. An Iranian judiciary official disputed the toll Tuesday as “sheer lies,” without offering any evidence to support his position.
The demonstrations show the widespread economic discontent gripping Iran since May 2018, when President Donald Trump imposed crushing sanctions after unilaterally withdrawing the United States from the nuclear deal that Tehran struck with world powers. Trump himself, speaking to journalists before a NATO summit in London, claimed without evidence Iran has killed “thousands.”
The demonstrations followed months of attacks across the Middle East that the U.S. blames on Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran has begun breaking the limits of the nuclear deal in hopes of pressuring Europe into finding a way for Tehran to sell its crude oil abroad despite the American sanctions.
The state TV report alleged that some of those killed were “rioters who have attacked sensitive or military centers with firearms or knives or have taken hostages in some areas.” Some sought to access arsenals inside the police and military posts, the report said.
In one case, the report said security forces confronted a separatist group armed with “semi-heavy weapons” in the city of Mahshahr in Iran’s southwestern Khuzestan province.
The Arab population of the surrounding oil-rich province long has complained of discrimination by Iran’s central government, and insurgent groups have attacked oil pipelines there. Iran blamed both area separatists and the Islamic State group for an attack on a military parade in the region in September 2018 that killed at least 25 people.
Online video purportedly from the area showed peaceful protests, as well as clashes between demonstrators and security forces, although the protesters appeared to be armed largely with rocks and debris.
“The marshes you see behind me and on the right are where hostile groups were hiding and shooting at the police, but praise to Allah, the armed forces deftly and vigilantly came to the field and foiled their plots,” Mahshahr police chief Col. Reza Papi said in the report.
Separately, a detainee shot and killed a police officer in the province Tuesday, state TV said, without elaborating.
State TV also acknowledged that security forces confronted “rioters” during the protests in Tehran, as well as in the cities of Shiraz and Sirjan. It also mentioned the Tehran suburb of Shahriar, where Amnesty on Monday said there had been “dozens of deaths.” It described the suburb as likely one of the areas with the highest death toll in the unrest. Shahriar has seen heavy protests.
Amnesty offered no breakdown for the deaths elsewhere in the country, although it said “the real figure is likely to be higher.”
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili disputed Amnesty’s death toll.
“I bluntly say that numbers and figures given by hostile groups are sheer lies,” he told reporters. “Real statistics are seriously different from what they announce, and numbers are far less than what they claim.”
However, Esmaili — like every other Iranian official since the crackdown — offered no evidence to support his claim, nor did he give any information on casualties. A U.N. agency also has said it fears the unrest may have killed “a significant number of people.”
He also said the “majority of the detainees” from the protests had been released, without offering any numbers. One lawmaker previously said he thought over 7,000 people had been arrested.
The death toll of at least 208 makes it the bloodiest unrest in Iran since the time of the Islamic Revolution. The 2009 Green Movement protests that followed a disputed presidential election drew millions to the streets but saw far less killing.
The demonstrations began Nov. 15 after the government raised minimum gasoline prices by 50% to 15,000 Iranian rials per liter. That’s 12 cents a liter, or about 50 cents a gallon. After a monthly 60-liter quota, it costs 30,000 rials a liter. That’s nearly 24 cents a liter or 90 cents a gallon. An average gallon of regular gas in the U.S. costs $2.58 by comparison, according to AAA.
Cheap gasoline is practically considered a birthright in Iran, home to the world’s fourth-largest crude oil reserves despite decades of economic woes. That disparity, especially given its oil wealth, fueled the anger felt by demonstrators.
Iranians have seen their savings chewed away by the rial’s collapse from 32,000 to $1 at the time of the 2015 nuclear accord to 127,000 to $1 today under the renewed U.S. sanctions. The cost of daily staples also has risen.
On Tuesday, Trump kept up the pressure, alleging without evidence that Iran was “killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak.” The protests largely have subsided, and no group has offered estimates that high.
“I think it’s a terrible thing and I think the world has to be watching,” Trump said.
Sitting beside French President Emmanuel Macron later, Trump told journalists that Iran is having “massive riots and protests all over the country.”
Asked if the U.S. supported the protesters, Trump said: “I don’t want to comment on that, but the answer is no.” He later clarified he meant America offered them no financial support, though it backed their aspirations.
In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani met with Yusuf bin Alawi, Oman’s minister responsible for foreign affairs. Alawi met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week in Washington. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has served as an interlocutor between Iran and the U.S. in the past.
Rouhani said the U.S. offers only slogans in its speeches that have led nowhere, while trying to cut deals in private that go against them.
Rouhani may end up traveling to Tokyo for a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek a way to save the nuclear deal, the Kyodo news agency reported, citing an anonymous official. Abe traveled to Iran in June but received a lecture from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on how Trump couldn’t be trusted. During that meeting, a suspected Iranian limpet mine attack damaged a Japanese oil tanker."
Asian shares mixed as Fed leaves rates unchanged,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-stocks-edge-higher-wall-street-watches-trade-67655052,"TOKYO --

The central bank had been expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged this month after lowering it three times this year to shield the economy from slowing global growth and the fallout of U.S. trade conflicts.
Investor jitters over whether the U.S. and China will be able to avert a new escalation in their trade war has made for choppy trading this week, pulling major indexes lower.
Wall Street is hoping that both sides can avoid a new round of tariffs scheduled to kick in Sunday on Chinese goods that include phones, laptops and other popular products.

Families of crash passengers want wider review,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/families-crash-passengers-wider-review-boeing-max-67606204,"
The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will face questions about whether the agency is too cozy with Boeing when he testifies this week before a congressional panel.
The chairman of the House Transportation Committee says he plans to ask FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson about Boeing's influence over the FAA's Seattle office and incidents in which FAA managers vetoed the concerns of the agency's own safety experts.
“We are having a hard time piercing the veil of how consistently and repeatedly Boeing is managing to pressure and overcome the objectives of the safety specialists,” committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Monday in an interview.
Dickson is scheduled to testify at a hearing Wednesday, just as the FAA gears up to review changes Boeing is making in its 737 Max jet. The Max remains grounded after two deadly crashes.
Investigations into the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia point to a flight-control system called MCAS that automatically pushed the noses of the planes down in response to faulty readings from a sensor. Boeing is making MCAS less powerful and tying it to a second sensor. It is also proposing material for training pilots about MCAS, and fixing a separate issue around flight-control computers. The company hopes airlines can resume using the Max early next year.
Relatives of passengers who died in the second crash say FAA is focusing too narrowly on Boeing's revamp of a flight-control system implicated in both accidents. They want a nose-to-tail review of every key system on the plane before the grounded planes can fly again.
“That's a tombstone mentality” to focus only on MCAS, said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter died in the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max. “You don't just wait until people die to address (other) systems.""
Chris Moore, whose daughter died in the Ethiopian crash, sent a list of questions that he hopes lawmakers will ask Dickson, including why the FAA didn't ground the Max after the first crash, when a Lion Air Max plunged into the sea off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018. 
About a dozen family members plan to attend Wednesday's hearing. They are driven by a deep distrust of Boeing, and a few have delved into the details of aircraft manufacturing. 
When Boeing's chief engineer told Congress that the company did not test what would happen if a single sensor tied to MCAS failed, family members and other critics seized on the disclosure to raise questions about Boeing's analysis of other key systems on the plane.
Boeing employees conducted those assessments under a decades-old FAA policy — strengthened in 2005 — of relying on the technical knowledge of the companies that it regulates. FAA inspectors are supposed to oversee the work of those company employees, but published reports suggest that the agency knew little about MCAS when it certified the Max.
DeFazio said Monday that the FAA program of relying on aircraft company employees “obviously needs significant improvement,” but he hasn't settled on how to do that. “I'm hoping Dickson can volunteer some ideas,"" he said.
Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines pilot and executive, will be testifying about the Max for the first time since he became FAA administrator in August.
During previous hearings, lawmakers have accused FAA of favoring Boeing and overruling FAA experts in two other cases. One involved the placement of rudder cables on the Max that, in the view of FAA engineers, could make them vulnerable to being severed if an engine blew apart in flight. 
The committee also plans to hear from several other witnesses, including Ed Pierson, a former Boeing production manager who protested a push to increase production of the Max. In an email to another Boeing executive in June 2018, which the committee made public in October, Pierson said he was hesitant to put his own family on a Boeing plane."
Judge upholds arbitration in Las Vegas newspaper battle,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-upholds-arbitration-las-vegas-newspaper-battle-67526317,"
A Nevada judge has upheld an arbitrator’s finding in an ongoing legal battle over one of the few remaining U.S. newspaper joint-operating agreements, ruling that the dominant Las Vegas Review-Journal has to submit to an audit and pay profits and expenses that its crosstown rival Las Vegas Sun claims have been improperly deducted in recent years.
Clark County District Court Judge Timothy Williams acknowledged during a Wednesday hearing that, with appeals expected and a separate federal lawsuit pending, his decision won’t settle an increasingly bitter fight over an operations pact entered in 1989 with an end date of 2040.
The judge put a hold on the state breach-of-contract case to allow a separate federal antitrust and unfair trade practices action filed by the Sun against the Review-Journal to be heard. He allowed the arbitration finding to remain sealed. 
Williams' written decision did not specify a dollar amount at stake, and attorneys and executives on both sides declined to disclose the amount. It is expected to be in the millions of dollars.
“The court will not reassess and weigh the evidence that the arbitrator relied on to make his decision,” the judge wrote. “The arbitrator noted that while the Review-Journal has done just about everything possible to blunt, avoid, deter and postpone an audit ... the arbitrator simply ordered that an audit be conducted and this decision is affirmed.”
Sun publisher and chief executive Brian Greenspun on Thursday called the ruling a victory in what he and Sun lawyers say is an attempt by the Review-Journal to kill the Sun.
“One of the ways they do that is through vexatious litigation,” Sun attorney James Pisanelli told Williams on Wednesday. “Another way they have done it ... is to starve the Las Vegas Sun.” 
Benjamin Lipman, Review-Journal legal counsel, focused on the stay that Williams put on the state case. Lipman denied Review-Journal owners want to eliminate the Sun.
“Nothing has been resolved,” he said. “The state court action is on hold. The federal case could have a significant effect. We’re not seeking to shut the Sun down. We’re saying they should stand on their own two feet.”
The Sun, formerly an afternoon daily, is printed and delivered as one section within the morning Review-Journal, which owns the printing presses. Their joint-operating agreement was amended in 2005 to require each newspaper to bear its own editorial costs and the Review-Journal to share an agreed-upon percentage of profits with the Sun.
The Sun argued in 2016 that it was due at least $6 million amassed during 10 years of business with former Review-Journal owner Stephens Media. That matter was settled after arbitration for an amount that was not made public.
The Review-Journal is now owned by the family of billionaire casino mogul and conservative Republican political donor Sheldon Adelson. He's the 86-year-old founder, chairman and chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which owns the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and casino-hotels in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau.
Adelson’s family bought the Review-Journal in December 2015 and owns it through a limited liability corporation called News + Media Capital Group. The Review-Journal was one of few U.S. newspapers to endorse Donald Trump for president in 2016.
Greenspun's newspaper characterizes itself as “a left-leaning editorial voice” and maintains a robust internet presence.
Pisanelli suggested in court Wednesday that the Review-Journal has violated federal antitrust law and declared that collecting the arbitrator’s judgment was a matter of survival for the Sun.
“The weaker party, the Las Vegas Sun ... has been at the mercy of the good faith of the R-J for all these decades,” the attorney said. “It’s only since Sheldon Adelson bought the paper that the good faith came to an end and the new strategy of starvation came into play.”
Newspaper joint operating agreements stem from the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, passed by Congress to exempt newspapers from some antitrust laws to allow them to combine business functions while remaining editorially independent. 
Las Vegas is one of a handful of U.S. cities with newspapers still operating under such an agreement, according to the News Media Alliance trade association. Others include York, Pennsylvania, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Detroit. A joint-operating agreement between the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News could expire next year.
Williams observed that the agreement in Las Vegas has not quieted what he termed “rolling disputes” between the two papers. The two sides have sued each other several times over the years in state and federal courts. The Review-Journal on Aug. 30 published a front-page editorial titled, ""Why we want to stop printing the Sun."" 
It called the joint-operating agreement a ""relic"" and argued the Sun doesn't meet contractual obligations to produce a “high-quality metropolitan print newspaper.""
The Sun in September filed the separate federal civil antitrust and unfair trade practices complaint.
Review-Journal attorney Randall Jones on Wednesday urged Williams to delay his decision, keep the arbitration findings sealed, and stop state court proceedings until the federal case is heard. 
Hearings before U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware have not yet been scheduled.
“It is practically creating a quagmire,” Jones told Williams, “because we don’t know what the federal court is going to do.” "
Elon Musk in court dances around meaning of ‘pedo guy’ tweet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/elon-musk-court-dances-meaning-pedo-guy-tweet-67482929,"
Elon Musk has owned up to insulting a British spelunker in a rash tweet, but wouldn’t concede on the witness stand that he called the man a pedophile.
The Tesla CEO returns to the witness stand Wednesday after spending several hours at his defamation trial trying to dance around the meaning of the “pedo guy” tweet he aimed at Vernon Unsworth, a cave diver who helped rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from a flooded Thailand cave last year.
Musk said the insult meant only “creepy old man” and did not literally mean he was calling Unsworth a pedophile.
The spat began when Unsworth ridiculed Musk’s effort in the rescue by having engineers at his companies, including Space X and The Boring Co., develop a mini-submarine that could transport the boys to safety. Despite working around the clock to build the sub in short order, Musk arrived in Thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used.
Unsworth called it nothing more than a “PR stunt” and said Musk could stick the sub “where it hurts.” Musk watched the CNN clip of Unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets July 15, 2018.
“It was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,” the billionaire told a Los Angeles federal court jury. “It was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.”
Unsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.
Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said during opening statements that Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called “joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.”
The shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.
Musk, who was dressed in a charcoal gray suit and white shirt, remained composed on the witness stand during questioning from Unsworth’s lawyer, who called him as his first witness.
His answers were at times humorous and sometimes seemed like those of an executive under court order to be careful about what he says.
Musk is required to have his tweets about Tesla screened as part of court settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he posted misleading information about the company that caused wild stock swings.
His tweet about Unsworth caused Tesla’s stock to drop about 3% the following day, though it recovered a day later.
After company officials tried to get Musk to apologize for the tweet, he responded in an email that he didn’t want look “foolish and craven” by doing so right after the stock dropped.
Musk projected an air of humility as he was asked about his influence in the world. He said he didn’t think his efforts to address climate change were taken seriously, that few people were aware of his goal to colonize Mars and he didn’t really pay attention to how his fortune stacks up against other billionaires.
With his arms crossed, Musk at times squinted and stared off in the distance as he searched for answers to events that occurred more than a year ago.
He clashed at one point with attorney L. Lin Wood, telling him he interpreted the lawyer’s letter threatening to sue as a shakedown and extortion attempt.
“I get these shakedown letters a lot,” Musk said. “I think you’re looking for a significant payday.”
Spiro attempted to humanize Musk, having him discuss his family — sets of 15-year-old twins and 13-year-old triplets, all boys. Musk choked up talking about a son who died as a baby and when asked about his childhood in South Africa.
“It wasn’t good,” he said after a long pause.
Musk said he was asked to help with the cave rescue and decided to get involved when he heard a Thai Navy diver died in the cave system and that a monsoon was forecast that could drown the soccer team.
Musk received no compensation for his efforts, though he acknowledged his work could have been interpreted as a “narcissistic” publicity effort.
Musk deleted the July 15, 2018, tweets and apologized on Twitter, though subsequent statements he made have called into question what he meant.
Musk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile by saying, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”
He told a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth to “stop defending child rapists,” followed by expletives.
Musk was asked about an almost comical attempt to dig up dirt on Unsworth when it became clear he could be sued.
One of his executives created a fake email account to communicate with a man who said he was an investigator, but then signed his own name on a nondisclosure agreement.
The investigator turned out to be a con man who was paid $52,000 and produced nothing damning about Unsworth.
Musk said he didn’t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue when he first tweeted about him and said “pedo guy” wasn’t asserted as a fact.
“Just as I didn’t literally mean he was a pedophile, I’m sure he didn’t literally mean shoving a sub up my ass,” Musk testified, provoking snickers.
When asked about the final line of his email to the Buzzfeed reporter that said he hoped Unsworth would sue him, Musk quipped: “I guess be careful what you wish for.”"
Some estimate Costco lost $11M with site crash,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/experts-estimate-costcos-website-crash-thanksgiving-couldve-cost/story?id=67386023,"
Costco's site experienced some technical trouble on Thanksgiving, potentially costing the company millions of dollars in lost sales.

The retail and deals site Love the Sales estimates the loss could reach $11 million. Love the Sales analyzed data from the amount of time that the Costco site was down and the total online sales revenue from last year, as well as other factors such as traffic and seasonality to come up with the $11 million figure.
""We calculate how much they make a day online. We also bring in things like seasonality. On Thursday it would be a much a higher sales period than say mid-April or something,"" Liam Solomon of Love The Sales told ABC News on Friday. ""We go by how many sales they should be making on that day per minute, and then we obviously times that by the amount of outage time and that is where we got the $11 million loss in sales.""
The website outage took place for 9,019 minutes, or approximately 16 hours, according to Solomon.

Costco promised steep discounts on laptops, TVs and more on Thursday only, and social media quickly lit up with angry Black Friday shoppers in the wake of the site crashing.

Costco did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Friday. In response to the outages, Costco said in a banner on its website that it was extending one-day Thanksgiving sales into Friday.

""The website is currently experiencing longer than normal response times,"" the website stated. ""Please note that all Thanksgiving Day-only promotions have been extended into Friday November 29th, WHILE SUPPLIES LAST. We apologize for any inconvenience.""
Some other major retailers reportedly experienced technical bumps on the key shopping holiday, including Nordstrom Rack, which was promising discounts of 50% off sale items and more.

""Nordstrom Rack went down, the only problem is there is not as much information on Nordstrom Rack as there is on Costco,"" Solomon said, noting that it was harder to calculate how that online crash impacted Nordstrom's bottom line.

More than 165 million people in the United States are expected to shop on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and through Cyber Monday, according to an annual survey released this month by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics.

California to protect insurance policies in wildfire areas,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/california-protect-insurance-policies-wildfire-areas-67530578,"
California on Thursday temporarily banned insurance companies from dropping customers in areas affected by more than a dozen recent blazes, invoking a new law for the first time as homeowners in the wildfire-plagued state say they are being pushed out of the commercial insurance market.
The order from Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara comes as the insurance industry struggles to adapt to a series of record-breaking hurricanes and wildfires that have cost the U.S.         $500 billion to clean up over the past five years.
California's move on Thursday will last for one year and it only covers people who live either inside or next to the perimeter of one of 16 wildfires that burned across the state in October. 
The Department of Insurance estimates the moratorium will affect 800,000 policies covering millions of people in portions of Los Angeles and Riverside counties in Southern California and Sonoma County in the northern part of the state.
“People have been dropped by their insurance companies after decades,” Lara said. “This needs to stop.”
Lara also called on commercial insurance companies statewide to voluntarily agree to not drop homeowners' insurance policies for the next year solely because of wildfire damage. But insurance companies say climate change leading to more intense and frequent natural disasters is making it harder for them to stay profitable.
Destructive wildfires in 2017 meant California insurers paid more than $2 for every $1 they collected in premiums. In 2017, they paid $1.70 for every $1 in premiums, according to state officials.
“Year-over-year losses that the industry has seen are not sustainable for companies or good for homeowners,"" said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California. 
Seven of the 10 most destructive wildfires in California history have happened in the last five years, including 2018's Camp Fire, which destroyed roughly 19,000 buildings and killed 85 people in and around the Northern California town of Paradise. That blaze alone generated more than $12 billion in insurance claims, according to the Department of Insurance.
Since 2015, state officials say insurance companies have declined to renew nearly 350,000 policies in areas at high risk for wildfires. That data does not include information on how many people were able to find coverage elsewhere or at what price.
One of those homeowners is Sean Coffey, who said he and his wife have struggled to maintain fire insurance on their home in Oakland.
“The pattern repeated itself almost every year since we bought our house. We would have (coverage) for 10 months. In the fall, we would get a notice we are being dropped,” he said.
Coffey now buys fire insurance from the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, an insurance pool mandated by state law that is required to sell policies to people who can't buy them through no fault of their own. He must purchase a second policy to cover risks other than fire.
Lara has the authority to order the moratorium under a bill he authored while in the state Senate last year that was signed into law by former Gov. Jerry Brown. The law took effect in January, and this is the first time regulators have used it.
While state officials rush to assist homeowners, a new report from California Auditor Elaine Howle said the state did not do enough to protect non-English speaking, elderly and other vulnerable residents during three of the state's most devastating fires in recent years.
The audit covered Butte County, site of 2018's Camp fire, plus the 2017 Thomas Fire that burned more than 281,000 acres in Ventura County and 2017 fires in Sonoma County that killed 24 people. The audit found none of the three counties had assessed its residents to determine who might need extra help and whether resources were available to help such people, such as transportation, during a natural disaster.
The audit also scolds the state oversight agency, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, for failing to assist counties in developing such plans and reviewing any plans in place. 
Howle says it was impossible to determine whether lives could have been saved ""if the counties had planned differently or more fully implemented the best practices""her office recommends in the report."" But she noted that “inadequate plans and insufficient planning are proven contributors to failure.”

Asylum seekers jam US border crossings to evade Trump policy,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asylum-seekers-jam-us-border-crossings-evade-trump-67471280,"
For months, asylum seekers have been prohibited from filing their claims at U.S. border crossings under a much-criticized Trump administration policy. Now some are sprinting down vehicle lanes or renting cars to try to make it inside the U.S.
The migrants’ efforts are causing traffic delays at Arizona crossings because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had to barricade lanes used by cars legally entering the U.S. from Mexico, officials said.
Advocates say many have become desperate after waiting for months to legally ask for asylum, often in poor conditions and while facing threats of kidnapping, extortion and violence south of the border.
Shoppers, teachers and visitors traveling to the U.S. through Nogales, Mexico, endured up to five-hour waits Monday and over the weekend, causing concerns among local officials whose tax base relies on Mexican shoppers, especially during the holiday season.
In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it’s committed to the safety of border crossers, adding that there’s been an increase of incursions through vehicle lanes “by asylum seekers attempting to evade established entry processes.”
“These tactics interfere with CBP officers conducting their responsibilities and exacerbates wait times for daily commuters,” the agency said in a statement. “CBP will not allow ports to be overrun, or unauthorized entry.”
The traffic jams could hurt sales at stores in Nogales, Arizona that depend on Mexican shoppers during the holiday season, said Mayor Arturo Garino.
Garino, a part-time teacher, said some students and teachers who live in Mexico but attend and work at schools across the border in the U.S. have been leaving their homes as early as 5 a.m. to arrive on time.
Garino said Mexican authorities were not doing enough to stem the problem. The Arizona Daily Star reported the Nogales, Sonora, police officers were checking cars headed north to the border on Monday afternoon.
The metal barricades are large and are meant to seal off traffic lanes.
About 3,000 migrants are living in Nogales, Mexico as they wait their turns to seek asylum, said Katie Sharar, communications director for the Kino Border Initiative, a religious-based group that provides meals to needy migrants on the Mexican side of the border.
Under a policy by the Trump administration known widely as “metering,” the asylum-seekers must wait in an unofficial line in Mexico until U.S. authorities call them up in a process that usually lasts several months.
Another policy, colloquially known as “Remain in Mexico,” requires asylum seekers to return to Mexico after they have made credible fear claims to justify their asylum requests and wait there while their immigration cases are pending.
“I think there’s just a lot of desperation and uncertainty. They don’t know what’s happening to them, they don’t know how the policy changes are gonna affect them,” Sharar said.
Sharar said she wasn’t familiar with the migrants who have run through vehicle lanes.
Customs and Border Protection did not respond to email and phone messages regarding questions about the migrants who rushed the border, what countries they come from and whether they were detained or faced criminal charges.
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said his first concern is public safety and that he is confident U.S. officials will resolve the border traffic problems.

New Amazon lease for NY space renews debate over failed deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amazon-lease-ny-space-renews-debate-failed-deal-67569251,"
Amazon has signed a lease for a new office space in Manhattan that will house more than 1,500 employees, less than a year after pulling out of a deal for a larger headquarters in the borough of Queens after politicians and activists objected to nearly $3 billion in incentives.
The new office almost immediately renewed a debate over whether the tax breaks and other incentives were excessive, given the likelihood that Amazon would continue to expand in New York City regardless because of the city's large talent pool. The online retail giant received no incentives for its new 335,000-square-foot complex in a building near Hudson Yards, a high-end commercial and residential development on the west side in midtown Manhattan.
Amazon said the new office will open in 2021 and will house employees from its consumer and advertisement teams. The Seattle-based company already has 3,500 employees in other New York offices, and the headquarters for its subsidiary Audible is in nearby Newark, New Jersey.
“As we shared earlier this year, we plan to continue to hire and grow organically across our 18 tech hubs, including New York City,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement.
Amazon dropped plans this year to build a $2.5 billion campus in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City that was projected to bring 25,000 new jobs over 15 years. The company had chosen Long Island City for one of two new headquarters after a fierce bidding war among more than 200 metropolitan areas that Amazon itself had stoked. The state and city had offered $2.8 billion in incentives that included $1.5 billion in tax breaks and grants, and a helipad near the new offices. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had lashed out at politicians and activists whose campaign helped unravel the Queens project, saying it threatened to undermine New York City's emergence as tech hub and squandered an opportunity for generate money for schools, housing and transit. Critics of the incentives package swiftly cited Amazon's latest corporate lease to argue those fears were unfounded.
“Amazon is coming to New York, just as they always planned. Fortunately, we dodged a $3 billion bullet by not agreeing to their subsidy shakedown earlier this year,"" New York state Sen. Michael Gianaris said in a statement. 
Cuomo pushed back against the reaction, saying the Queens headquarters would have brought in more jobs and the new office will not benefit Long Island City.
“This is crumbs from the table compared to a feast,” Cuomo said. “We don’t have a problem bringing businesses to Manhattan but we have been trying for decades to get that Queens waterfront developed.”
Mayor Bill DeBlasio had blamed Amazon for pulling out of the deal prematurely. His office did so again Saturday, while lamenting that Long Island City had lost out on Amazon's expansion plans. 
“Amazon couldn’t take the heat and didn’t want to work in good faith with New Yorkers. Now, New York is getting just a fraction of the jobs and Queens is getting none of the benefits,"" said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for the mayor.
Even before the deal unraveled, experts said Amazon's choice of New York City underscored that its main concern when it comes to expansion is access to talent at a time of fierce competition for computer programmers, mobile app developers, data scientists and cybersecurity experts. The company is continuing with its plans to build another headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. that is also a emerging tech hub.
New York has a thriving start-up scene, and big tech companies are already rapidly expanding their presence in the city. Facebook announced a deal last month to lease 1.5 million square feet of office space in Hudson Yards. Google and Instagram have also opened new offices in recent years.
“Utimately, what Amazon needs is qualified tech talent and that's why it needs to be in New York,"" said Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institute. 
Still, Parilla said the large incentive package was targeted at luring Amazon to one of New York's outer boroughs, which have not benefited from the tech boom like Manhattan has. 
“Everyone who was pushing for this investment understood that New York would be fine either way overall. Within that context, they were trying to make a more precise argument, which is that Long Island City was not reaping the benefits,"" Parilla said. 
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents a Queens district near Long Island City, said officials had been offering costly incentives in exchange for a promise of jobs that were not guaranteed.
“The 25,000 jobs figure was a 10-20 year fantasy ... from Amazon, not a promise or agreement,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. 
She added that the 1,500 new jobs Amazon is now adding “are for FREE.""

Firm hands out $10M in holiday bonuses to 198 employees,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/firm-hands-10m-holiday-bonuses-198-employees-67664945,"BALTIMORE -- 
A commercial real estate developer is handing out a total of $10 million in bonuses to its 198 employees.
WTOP         reported Monday that Baltimore-based St. John Properties announced the bonuses at the company's holiday party. 
Edward St. John, the founder and chairman of the company, said the amount of money that each employee gets is based on tenure. The average bonus was $50,000, but some employees will get upward of $250,000.
The company has employees throughout Maryland and northern Virginia. The bonuses celebrate the company’s achievement of developing 20 million square feet of office space, retail and warehouses. That real estate is spread out over eight states.
Edward St. John said that he is ""thankful for every one of our employees for their hard work and dedication. I couldn’t think of a better way to show it.”
The company was founded in 1971. It has retail and warehouse space in Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin."
AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misstatements at NATO summit,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-fact-check-trumps-misstatements-nato-summit-67471039,"
President Donald Trump on Tuesday wholly misrepresented the U.S. record on international trade disputes and dismissed as a mysterious “rumor” his own statement from months ago about Britain's health system.
Here's a look at some of his statements from London, where's he is attending a NATO meeting:
TRUMP: “We won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations.” — remarks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.
The U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. had won 91% of times it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the Geneva-based trade monitor. 
As Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case.
As for his claim that the U.S. “won” $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right.
Trump was referring to a WTO decision         in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion.
The WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus — a fight that began long before Trump was in office.

TRUMP: “We have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe.” — remarks with French President Emmanuel Macron.
MACRON: There are “very large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region.” Those from Europe are ""a tiny minority of the overall problem.""
THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. 
Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq.
European nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims.

TRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: “I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.” — remarks with Jens Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a “rumor.”
Asked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said “when you're dealing in trade, everything’s on the table. So, NHS or anything else.""
The service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services firms can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. 
As well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharma firms more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs.
Leaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 — released by the Labour Party last week — said “patent issues” around “NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration” in talks.
It’s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be “selling off” the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill.
But it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would “want nothing to do"" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump’s words.

TRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: “We have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want."" — remarks with Stoltenberg.
THE FACTS: That’s not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can’t do anything it wants with it.
As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. “Maybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,” McGurk         told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil.
While Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he’s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any Islamic State resurgence.
The Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to ""reinforce"" control of the oil fields and prevent them from “falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors.”

Court seems ready to curb claims over Montana Superfund site,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/court-ready-curb-claims-montana-superfund-site-67468993,"
The Supreme Court seemed inclined Tuesday to rule that Montana homeowners who are seeking additional cleanup of arsenic left over from years of copper smelting need the permission of the Environmental Protection Agency.
That outcome would be a loss for the homeowners and a win for Atlantic Richfield Co. The BP-owned company is the owner of the shuttered Anaconda smelter that is at the center of a 300-square-mile Superfund site. The company says it has spent $470 million to clean the site.
The justices heard arguments over the company's effort to shut down claims in state court that it should have to pay more. Homeowners who are dissatisfied with the         EPA-ordered cleanup want Atlantic Richfield to pay for the removal of more arsenic-tainted soil from their properties.
A high court ruling for Atlantic Richfield would not end the claims, but it would be significantly harder for the homeowners to pursue their lawsuit in Montana courts.
Several justices seemed troubled by the idea that property owners whose land has been contaminated could undertake cleanup without EPA approval. Digging up a yard to put in a sand box for children could “stir up infected dirt that could harm your neighbors many miles away,” Chief Justice John Roberts said.
Joseph Palmore, the lawyer representing homeowners in Opportunity, Montana, said the EPA has conceded it has ample authority to stop people who take measures that are inconsistent with the cleanup of a Superfund site.
But Justice Elena Kagan remarked that it might be hard for the EPA to ”go around and try to figure out who's creating          sand boxes "" on Superfund sites.
The EPA is supporting the company at the Supreme Court.
The Montana Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the homeowners could pursue their claims against Atlantic Richfield in state court. "
"US added 266K jobs in November, unemployment remains at 50-year low",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-added-266k-jobs-november-unemployment-remains-50/story?id=67542550,"
The U.S. economy added a solid 266,000 jobs in November, exceeding economists' exceptions by nearly 80,000 jobs, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday.

Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents to $28.29 and unemployment remained at a 50-year low of 3.5%.

The data indicates the economy has continued to remain stable in the U.S. over the past year despite escalating trade tensions and other potential threats.
Employers added the most jobs in the health care (an increase of 45,000 jobs) and professional and technical services industries (which saw an increase of 31,000 jobs).
November also saw a rise in manufacturing jobs though this was likely due to unionized autoworkers returning to work after the strike at General Motors. The previous month saw a decline of 43,000 jobs in manufacturing, also likely due to the strike.

The average work week remained unchanged in November at 34.4 hours a week. In manufacturing, however, the average work week increased slightly, by 0.1 hours, to 40.5 hours a week, as overtime decreased by 0.1 hours.

An average of 180,000 jobs have been added per month so far in 2019 compared to an average gain of 223,000 in 2018. Friday's report also revised September's and October's figures to indicate 41,000 more jobs were added than previously reported.

DeVos calls for making financial aid unit a separate agency,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/devos-calls-making-financial-aid-unit-separate-agency-67472058,"
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says Congress should consider splitting her department’s financial aid operation into a separate federal agency with the flexibility to operate like a private bank.
DeVos made the comments Tuesday in Reno, Nevada, at an annual conference hosted by the Education Department’s Federal Student Aid division, which oversees and manages nearly $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.
Speaking to financial aid professionals, DeVos said the student lending division has become an “untamed beast” after years of tinkering by Congress, and that it needs to become a “world-class financial firm.”
“One has to wonder: Why isn’t FSA a standalone government corporation, run by a professional, expert, and apolitical board of governors?” DeVos said during her remarks.
She went on to describe an agency that would report to Congress while remaining “truly independent from interference, political or otherwise.” She said it would “partner” with schools to provide student grants and loans.
Any proposal to spin off lending operations would require approval from Congress. Her plan did not come with any legislation, but instead she called on members of Congress to discuss her proposal.
The proposal was met with skepticism by some in Congress, including Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
“The Federal Student Aid office should already be putting students at the center of its work and should already be free from political whims,” Scott said. “The department should focus its time and resources on implementing the existing student loan programs in good faith. There’s nothing that could be done with a new agency that can’t be done today.”
In her remarks, DeVos said a separate FSA ""would do all the things it’s been charged to do — only far better.”
She has long argued that the government plays an outsized role in student lending, often describing it as a “government monopoly” that has become costly to taxpayers and students alike.
She has criticized the Obama administration for taking over federal loans that were previously provided by private banks, saying it fueled higher levels of borrowing and gave schools incentive to raise tuition rates.
At the same time, DeVos says Congress has created a confusing web of programs that students struggle to navigate as they borrow loans, pay them back or pursue programs that provide debt forgiveness.
“Just look at today’s parade of repayment options, forgiveness plans, unlimited lending, and complex rules,” she said Tuesday. “Is it any wonder students are having bad experiences?”
DeVos is proposing a radical shift in strategy at the same time that Democrats in Congress are ramping up scrutiny of her handling of multiple federal loan programs.
The House’s education committee has threatened to subpoena DeVos to determine why her agency has stopped processing loan forgiveness claims from students who say they were defrauded by their schools.
She faces similar scrutiny amid findings that the Education Department has rejected the vast majority of applications for the federal government’s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.
DeVos denies wrongdoing and blames Congress for creating programs with overly complex rules. She revived that criticism Tuesday before calling on Congress to cooperate with her proposal.
“President Trump and this administration are committed to transforming Federal Student Aid for students,” DeVos said. “Congress needs to come alongside us to make this happen.”"
Traffic jams cripple Paris as pension strikes halt trains,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/traffic-jams-cripple-paris-pension-strikes-halt-trains-67594831,"
Paris commuters inched to work Monday through massive traffic jams as strikes against retirement plan changes halted trains and subways for a fifth straight day.
French President Emmanuel Macron girded for one of the toughest weeks of his presidency as his government prepares to present a redesign of the convoluted French pension system. He sees melding 42 different retirement plans into one as delivering a more equitable, financially sustainable system. Unions see the move as an attack on the French way of life even though Macron's government is not expected to change the current retirement age of 62.
Citing safety risks, the SNCF national rail network warned travelers to stay home or use ""alternative means of locomotion"" to get around Monday instead of thronging platforms in hopes of getting the few available trains running.
As a result, the national road authority reported more than 600 kilometers (360 miles) of traffic problems at morning rush hour around the Paris region — up from 150 kilometers (90 miles) on an average day.
The road traffic was worse Monday than when the strike started last week, because many French employees managed to work from home or take a day off then. But that's increasingly difficult as the strike wears on.
Gabriella Micuci from the Paris suburb of Le Bourget walked several kilometers (miles) in cold rain and then squeezed into a packed subway on one of the two automated Metro lines that don't need drivers. Other commuters used shared bikes or electric scooters.
“I left home earlier than usual, I thought I was going to be able to catch an early train but not at all,"" Micuci told The Associated Press. “It’s a real catastrophe, people are becoming even more violent, they are pushing you.”
Fortified by the biggest nationwide demonstrations in years when the strike launched last Thursday, unions plan new protests on Tuesday and hope to keep up the pressure on Macron's government to back down on         the retirement reform.
Only about a sixth of French trains were running Monday and international train lines also saw disruptions. Union activists also blocked bus depots around Paris, limiting bus routes.
Macron summoned Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and other top officials Sunday night to         strategize for a crucial week.
The prime minister will present details of the government's plan on Wednesday, which is expected to encourage people to work longer. Currently some French workers can retire in their 50s.
The reform is central to Macron's vision of transforming the French economy. Government ministers insist the current system is unfair and financially unsustainable, while unions say the reform undercuts worker rights and will force people to work longer for less.
Seeking to head off public anger, Macron asked veteran politician Jean-Paul Delevoye to hold months of meetings with workers, employers and others to come up with recommendations for France's new retirement plan. Delevoye is presenting his conclusions to unions on Monday."
Stocks are mostly lower on Wall Street with trade in focus,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-stocks-open-lower-investors-weigh-outlook-trade-67597759,"
Stocks closed modestly lower on Wall Street Monday as losses in technology, health care and financial companies outweighed gains elsewhere in the market.
The selling snapped a three-day winning streak for the S&P 500 and wiped out the index's 0.2% gain last week. 
Trading was mostly muted as investors looked ahead to a busy week of economic reports and an interest rate policy update from the Federal Reserve. The market also remained focused on developments in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.
Both sides have been working toward a limited “phase 1” deal that investors hope can at least avert new U.S. tariffs from kicking in on $160 billion of Chinese imports on Sunday. That would raise prices on key products, including cell phones and laptops, and threaten to affect consumers.
“With the deadline being Sunday, most people don't think that new tariffs will be put in place, but they also don't expect a phase 1 (deal) to be signed this week,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
The S&P 500 index lost 9.95 points, or 0.3%, to 3,135.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 105.46 points, or 0.4%, to 27,909.60. The Nasdaq dropped 34.70 points, or 0.4%, to 8,621.83. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gave up 4.22 points, or 0.3%, to 1,629.62.
Major stock indexes in Europe also closed broadly lower.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.82% from 1.84% late Friday.
After strong gains in November, U.S. stock indexes have mostly pulled back this month ahead of the scheduled rollout of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this weekend.
A Chinese official said Monday that the nation wants a prompt settlement, but gave no details on progress toward a potential deal. China made a conciliatory gesture last week when it said it would waive tariffs on American soybeans and pork.
Technology sector stocks, which have been particularly sensitive to developments on trade because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains, helped drag the market lower Monday. Apple fell 1.4% and chipmaker Micron Technology slid 3.1%.
Industrial stocks also fell. United Airlines dropped 1.1% and General Electric dropped 1%. Abiomed led the slide in health care stocks, falling 4%. Banks fell as bond yields declined. Goldman Sachs dropped 1.2%.
Several retailers helped lift the consumer discretionary stocks sector. Home Depot gained 1.1% and rival Lowe's rose 1.4%. Target picked up 1.1%.
Traders also weighed several big health care sector deals.
Shares in ArQule more than doubled on news that Merck agreed to buy the small biotechnology company for $2.7 billion. ArQule is in the early stages of studying potential treatments for conditions including leukemia. Merck inched 0.1% higher.
Sanofi made a similar play, spending $2.5 billion for Synthorx, which is also in the earlier stages of testing cancer treatments. Sanofi fell 1.6% and Synthorx jumped more than threefold.
In other deal news, health insurer United HealthGroup said it is buying Diplomat Pharmacy to help bolster its pharmacy benefits unit, OptimRx. The deal is being made at a steep discount, which sent Diplomat’s stock plunging 32.7%. UnitedHealth dropped 0.9%.
PG&E vaulted 15.9% following late Friday's news that the California utility has reached a tentative $13.5 billion settlement that resolves all major claims related to the deadly, devastating Northern California wildfires of 2017-2018. The blazes were blamed on PG&E's outdated equipment and negligence. The deal, which still requires court approval, represents a key step in PG&E's exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Wall Street is in for a busy week of economic reports culminating in a key update on whether Americans are still spending at a healthy pace.
Investors will get a revised report on worker productivity for the July-September quarter on Tuesday. Data released in November showed a decline for the first time since late 2015. On Wednesday the government will release its November report for consumer prices, which have been rising at a modest rate this year. A gauge on producer prices will be released on Thursday.
The Commerce Department’s report on retail sales coming up Friday is possibly the most important update this week. The economy has been propped up in part by solid spending and job growth.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to deliver its latest economic and interest rate policy update on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policymakers. The central bank is widely expected hold off on making any changes to interest rates.
“The market does not expect a rate cut in December, but is probably still holding out for one or two in 2020,” Stovall said. “We think the Fed is going to sit pat and not really do anything.”
The Fed cut interest rates three times this year in a bid to buttress economic growth. That nearly reversed four rate hikes in 2018. The Fed has signaled that it will hold off on any additional rate cuts while the economy remains healthy.

US and China near deal that would suspend planned tariffs,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-envoys-close-communication-ahead-us-deadline-67679717,"WASHINGTON -- 
The Trump administration and China are close to finalizing a modest trade agreement that would suspend tariffs that are set to kick in Sunday, de-escalating their 17-month trade war.
""We're close to a deal,'' said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of international affairs, who has been briefed by both sides.
Brilliant said the administration has agreed to suspend Trump's plans to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports Sunday and to reduce existing tariffs, though it wasn't clear by how much.
In return, Beijing would buy more U.S. farm products, increase Americans companies' access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights. 
The deal awaits final approval from President Donald Trump.
Trump took to Twitter early Thursday to declare: “Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!""'
Earlier Thursday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, had told reporters that “the economic and trade teams of both sides have maintained close communication.” He offered no additional details to release.
Beijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday.
The two sides are negotiating a so-called Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute.
Still, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.
The administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driver-less cars and artificial intelligence. The administration alleges — and independent analysts generally agree — that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals.
Beijing rejects the accusations and contends that Washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade.
Since July 2018, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on $360 billion in Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trump's supporters in rural America.
On Sunday, the U.S. is scheduled to start taxing another $160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.
Repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve even a preliminary agreement. The prolonged uncertainty over Trump's trade policies has slowed U.S. business investment and likely held back economic growth. Many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when, how or even whether the trade standoff will end.
A far-reaching agreement on China's technology policies will likely prove difficult. It would require Beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology, something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence.
Efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through Chinese law and government. Security researchers have asserted that Beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products.
The Trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with China, reflecting its contention that Beijing has violated past promises. One way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage. "
Pinterest and The Knot take a stand against 'plantation weddings',https://abcnews.go.com/Business/pinterest-knot-stand-plantation-weddings/story?id=67499154,"
The popular wedding-planning sites Pinterest and The Knot announced they are no longer promoting content for ""plantation""-style weddings.

""Weddings should be a symbol of love and unity. Plantations represent none of those things,"" a Pinterest spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Wednesday.
""We are grateful to Color of Change for bringing attention to this disrespectful practice,"" the statement added, referencing a California-based racial justice advocacy organization.

The company said it's ""working to limit the distribution of this content and accounts across our platform, and continue to not accept advertisements for them.""

Celebrities including Blake Lively have tied the knot at ""plantation"" venues, which are popular in the South. The wedding trend has been widely slammed for romanticizing the horrific history of slavery in the U.S.
""The wedding industry, in the past couple of decades, has made millions of dollars in profit by promoting plantations as romantic places to marry,"" Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, interim senior campaign director at Color of Change, told ABC News' ""Start Here"" podcast. ""Unfortunately, this denies the actual reality.""

She went on to say that ""plantations were spaces where black people were harmed, raped, beaten and forced to work. They're not romantic places to get married.""
Ogunnaike said that oftentimes, the plantations are marketed in a way that glosses over the plantations' dark past, describing them as historic sites, for example.

""We asked ourselves, 'What is some of the language that people are using to describe these plantation venues? ... Some of it might be this plantation is a historic site with a traditional charm and romance of its rich past or an enchanting place that [ends up being] a historic plantation,"" she told ""Start Here."" ""They might know certain buildings were built in the...1700s by large, land-owning families without also naming that these families also owned human beings.""

Pinterest told ABC News it will limit the distribution of ""plantation weddings"" content by changing its site's autocomplete, search recommendations, email notifications and SEO. If people search for this content, an advisory will indicate that some results may violate its policies.

Moreover, Pinterest said it won't accept ads for these venues and has taken action so that ads won't appear in search results.

The Knot Worldwide told ABC News in a statement that it's also working with Color of Change to update its guidelines.
""Color of Change brought an issue to light about the way venues with a history of slavery describe their properties to couples,"" the company said. ""We're currently working with Color of Change to create additions to our current content guidelines that will ensure all couples feel welcomed and respected on our sites.""

The new guidelines ""will prohibit any vendors on The Knot or WeddingWire from using language that romanticizes or glorifies a history that includes slavery,"" the company's statement said. ""We will remove any vendors from our sites that do not comply. By creating these guidelines, we are providing a respectful experience for all couples, wedding professionals, and employees.""

Although the ideal outcome would be that no one marries on plantations, Ogunnaike said their focus is really on keeping the advertising honest.

""What we're focusing on is the plantation should not be able to advertise their rich history and tradition, which involved the enslavement of black people, as a marketing tool,"" she said. ""If we were also honest about the fact that [the original owners] also purchased human beings and that...hundreds...or thousands of slaves were beaten and hurt and raped, would people want to still get married in that space? That is what we're able to change; the guidelines in a way that these are being descriptive in popular culture."" "
Exxon Mobil prevails in lawsuit over climate regs,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-rules-exxon-mobil-suit-climate-regulations-67627298,"NEW YORK -- 
Exxon Mobil prevailed Tuesday in a closely watched lawsuit over the costs of climate change, with a judge saying there was no proof the energy giant duped investors about the toll that regulations could take on its business.
New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't prove the company made any material misstatements ""that misled any reasonable investor,” state judge Barry Ostrager in Manhattan wrote in dismissing the case.
“Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve Exxon Mobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases,” he added. “But Exxon Mobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.”
Exxon Mobil Corp. hailed the ruling in a trial that it said stemmed from a “baseless investigation.” 
“We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change,” the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement. “Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change.”
James, however, said the case “laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading, and confusing representations to the American people about the company’s response to climate change regulations.” 
“The oil giant never took seriously the severe economic impact that climate change regulations would have on the company, contrary to what they were telling the public,” the Democrat said in a statement. 
The suit sought an estimated $476 million to $1.6 billion in restitution to shareholders. It also was seen as something of a bellwether for how investors view oil and gas companies' prospects in light of global warming and the new regulations it's expected to spur.
The lawsuit accused Exxon Mobil of essentially keeping two sets of books — telling the public that it was fully taking into account the costs of potential future climate regulations in a warming world, while lowballing those costs behind the scenes as it made investment decisions and assessed the value of its oil and gas reserves.
The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and heat is the main source of manmade heat-trapping carbon emissions. Scientists have warned that the world must cut those emissions to stave off the worst effects of warming.
Exxon Mobil has used two different metrics to account for potential carbon costs: a ""proxy cost"" for predicting how regulations worldwide might reduce demand for oil and gas, and a ""greenhouse gas cost"" used to figure how local regulations might affect specific projects.
Its executives and attorneys said the company applied the appropriate costs depending on the situation. But the attorney general's office said the two-part system added up to minimizing emissions price tags on some oil and gas development projects, making them look more financially attractive. 
""Exxon applied much lower costs or no costs at all,"" attorney Jonathan Zweig said last month in the state's closing argument after a 12-day trial. 
Exxon Mobil said it did nothing wrong, was serious about grappling with climate change and had no incentive to underestimate its future costs.
""We knew it was a real issue,"" former CEO and ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified in October. ""We tried to understand how this was going to affect everything.”
He said Exxon Mobil's system for gauging climate risks and costs that was “as robust as we could make it at the time, and continued to try to improve it.” 
The judge noted there was no testimony from any actual investors who claimed to have been deceived, and he credited the company with “a culture of disciplined analysis, planning, accounting and reporting.”"

State of Sandy Hook shooting takes steps to divest from guns,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/state-sandy-hook-shooting-takes-steps-divest-guns-67467784,"
Connecticut’s treasurer, who oversees $37 billion in public pension funds, announced plans Tuesday to reallocate $30 million worth of shares in civilian firearm manufacturer securities while banning similar future investments and creating incentives for banks and financial institutions to enact gun-related policies.
If ultimately approved by an advisory board, it will mark the first time Connecticut has taken the step of divesting shares in firearm-related companies since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, which left 20 small children and six educators dead.
Treasurer Shawn Wooden’s predecessor had attempted to influence the practices of such manufacturers, an approach Wooden noted hasn’t stopped gun violence.
“I believe divestment should be a tool of last resort, and I support engagement and engaged ownership as a shareholder. The sad truth is, even working with other institutional investors throughout the country, engagement on this issue has not worked,” he said in an interview. “The cost, the economic cost, the social cost of gun violence is very, very significant. And the time is now because we don't have greater action in Washington on this issue.”
Connecticut pension funds are currently invested in five of 17 companies identified by an independent index as producers of guns and ammunition.
The proposal comes as the U.S. Supreme Court turns to gun rights for the first time in nearly a decade, hearing arguments Monday related to a dispute over now-defunct New York City restrictions on taking licensed, locked and unloaded guns outside city limits. The high court could sidestep the issue or possibly expand gun rights.
Wooden contends the intent of his plan, which was released first to The Associated Press, is not to put gun manufacturers out of business. The Democrat, who lost a cousin to gun violence, said he supports “responsible” gun manufacturing and gun usage but argues that it is his job to reduce risk to the state’s pension funds and that “guns have been an incredibly risky proposition.”
Last month, the Connecticut State Supreme Court said a survivor and relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting could pursue their         lawsuit against Remington Arms, the maker of the rifle used by the shooter. The company has argued it should be shielded by a 2005 federal law preventing most lawsuits against firearms manufacturers when their products are used in crimes.
Wooden also hopes to influence the financial services and gun industries.
His plan would continue to allow state pension funds to be invested in companies involved in “smart gun” technology. It also would require banks and investment companies to describe their gun policies in any responses to requests for proposals from the Connecticut treasurer’s office. Those policies will be considered, among other factors, when business is awarded.
Wooden announced Tuesday that Citigroup will be the senior underwriter on Connecticut’s upcoming issuance of $890 million in general obligation bonds.
Under a 2018 policy, Citigroup is requiring its clients and business customers not to sell a firearm to anyone who hasn't passed a background check or anyone under age 21. It is also not allowing customers to sell what are known as bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.
U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, sharply criticized Citigroup for the move at the time, accusing the bank of “threatening law-abiding business owners for exercising their Second Amendment rights.”
The National Rifle Association has also accused “America’s financial elite” of wanting to “create a world in which America’s public policy decisions emanate from corporate boardrooms in Manhattan rather than from citizens and their elected officials.”
Connecticut is not alone in trying to use the power of the purse to influence the gun violence debate.
In 2018, the $222.5 billion California State Teachers’ Retirement System voted to use its financial might to pressure gun retailers to stop selling military-style assault weapons and accessories. Critics accused the board of setting a dangerous precedent."
Saudi prince's ambitions hinge on triumphant Aramco sale,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/saudi-princes-ambitions-hinge-triumphant-aramco-sale-67602130,"
Saudi Arabia is expected to set a new record for the largest stock flotation in history on Wednesday with the sale of part of Aramco, the state-owned oil company valued at $1.7 trillion. 
The  offering's  success is crucial to the ambitious plan by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul Saudi Arabia's economy and wean it off its reliance on oil revenue for survival.
The company is looking to raise  $29.4 billion from selling a 1.7% stake on the local Saudi exchange, making it the world's biggest ever initial public offering. Prince Mohammed had envisioned an even bigger stock market debut for the kingdom's crown jewel. The aim is to attract foreign investment to rapidly create jobs for millions of young Saudis entering the workforce as he prepares to inherit the throne. 
The government has traditionally been the primary employer of Saudis, but lower oil prices, a budget deficit and a large young population mean the private sector must expand to absorb new entrants into the workforce to keep unemployment from rising beyond 12%. 
The flotation is ""a step in the right direction that will enable the crown prince to build confidence around Aramco,” said Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group's Middle East division. 
That could lead to confidence in the Saudi economy and generate billions of dollars in capital to invest in job-creating projects, analysts say.
What the 34-year-old crown prince had initially sought was a $2 trillion valuation for Aramco and the sale of up to 5% of the company - on an international stock exchange as well as the Saudi market - that could raise $100 billion.
Instead, potential buyers thought his $2 trillion valuation was too high. And the company ditched plans to list outside Saudi Arabia, amid headwinds including lower oil prices, heightened geopolitical tensions and climate change concerns.
In September, Aramco's main crude oil processing plant and an oil field were struck by missiles and drones, knocking out about half of Saudi Arabia's daily production or nearly 6% of global daily crude production. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia blame Iran for the attack. Iran has denied the allegations. 
The attack underscored how Aramco’s stability and security is tied to that of the Saudi government and its ruling family, who also stipulate Aramco's oil production levels.
Just Friday, OPEC and allies like Russia said they would cut oil production by another 500,000 barrels per day to support prices. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's heavyweight, said it would shoulder 40% of that cut and bring its daily production down by 200,000 barrels to 9.7 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's deeper cuts could support Aramco's valuation.
The company, which has exclusive rights to produce and sell Saudi Arabia's oil, remains extremely profitable. It made net income of $111 billion last year, more than any other company globally. Profits were down for the first nine months of this year, but still rang in at a sizable $68 billion. 
Aramco's overall worth exceeds that of the world's top two companies, Microsoft and Apple. At $1.7 trillion, Aramco is also worth more than the top five oil companies - Exxon Mobil, Total, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP - combined. 
Greg Priddy, director of global energy at consultancy Stratfor, says it seems unlikely that Aramco will try to list its shares on an exchange outside Saudi Arabia once a 12-month block  on doing so expires. That's because it could undermine Aramco's valuation, which he says is being artificially bolstered domestically in the short term as it lacks large-scale foreign investors
Rather than pursue a “more realistic valuation and course of action,” Priddy said the crown prince appeared to be driven by a need for a ""big win"" in terms of domestic prestige and public confidence. In practice, that could weaken the prince's plan, dubbed Vision 2030, to diversify the economy away from oil.
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Friday expressed confidence that Aramco will reach a high valuation.
“It will be higher than the 2 trillion and l can bet that this will happen,” he said. 
By choosing to list locally, Saudi Arabia made it so that only Saudi nationals, expatriate residents of Saudi Arabia and Gulf nationals could buy the stock as individual investors. 
""We kept it to our family and friends,"" Prince Abdulaziz said. 
The company said last week that it was selling 0.5% to individual investors and 1% to institutional investors, valuing the IPO at $25.6 billion. One of the IPO advisers, Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank, said Monday that Aramco has since exercised an option to sell more shares, for a total stake of 1.7% valued at $29.4 billion. A senior executive at the bank quoted by the Saudi Al Arabiya broadcaster, said foreign investors represented 23% of institutional investor interest in the IPO, with Saudi funds making up the bulk, including a sizable interest registered by the Saudi Public Pension Agency.
To encourage Saudi citizens to buy and keep hold of the stock, the company says it will pay a dividend of at least $75 billion in 2020. Individual Saudi investors who hold their shares for six months from the first day of trading can receive up to 100 bonus shares, or one for every 10 held. The government also encouraged Saudis by making it easier to access credit for stock purchases. There were reports that the prince, who led a shakedown of top royals and businessmen during an anti-corruption sweep in 2017, also pressed wealthy Saudis to contribute. 
The result was that just over 5 million individuals, nearly all of them Saudi nationals out of a population of around 20 million citizens, generated subscriptions of $13 billion.
Institutional investors, many of them Saudi or Gulf-based funds, raised more than $100 billion during the book-building period that closed last week.
“If they are able to garner enough interest right now, that should provide a benchmark for the pricing of Aramco shares... and that can be used at a later date when they’re trying to go for an international market,” said Ranjith Raja, a lead analyst at Refinitiv.
Kamel, of Eurasia Group, said the real test for the prince's diversification plans will come in 12 or 18 months when Aramco could choose to sell more shares on an international exchange. 
“If they’re not able to sequence it and present a credible plan that will attract a large set of investors, then I think that would mean Vision 2030 as a whole is at risk,” he said. “That’s why this IPO or the public listing in Tadawul is one positive step, but it’s insufficient.”"
Southwest to share $125M from Boeing settlement with workers,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/southwest-share-125m-boeing-settlement-workers-67683221,"DALLAS -- 
Southwest Airlines will share about $125 million from a Boeing settlement with its workers. 
The Dallas carrier has been among the hardest hit by the grounding of Boeing's Max 737 airplanes in March after a pair of deadly crashes. Without the planes, Southwest has said that it will cancel about 175 flights each weekday. Southwest had 34 MAX planes when they were grounded and had expected more to be delivered this year 
Earlier this month, the airline pushed back the return date for the troubled aircraft. The planes will not be included on flight schedules until at least March 6, a month longer than         previously planned, citing continued uncertainty.
The airline said Thursday that the money given to employees will be funded as part of its annual 2019 profit sharing distribution next year. Southwest workers will also find out next year more details on the percentage of money they will receive.
The settlement details with Boeing are confidential.
Southwest Airlines Co. is in ongoing talks with Boeing Co. about compensation for damages related to the Max groundings. "
Malaysia’s ex-PM Najib seeks to show he’s victim of fugitive,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/malaysias-pm-najib-seeks-show-hes-victim-fugitive-67455427,"
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak sought to show he was the victim of a cunning fugitive financier as he opened his defense Tuesday in his first corruption trial linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of the 1MDB state investment fund.
Najib is defending himself against seven charges of abuse of power, breach of trust and money laundering relating to 42 million ringgit ($10.1 million) that allegedly went into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB fund.
The high court judge last month said it was clear Najib, who was also finance minister at the time, wielded “overarching authority and power” in SRC and had acted for personal gains.
Standing in the witness stand in his crisp blue suit, Najib outlined 1MDB’s formation and the role of financier Low Taek Jho, who has been identified by U.S. investigators as the mastermind behind the massive scandal that is being probed in several countries.
He said 1MDB was originally a sovereign wealth fund started by the northeastern Terengganu state together with the state ruler, who was Malaysia’s king at the time. Ethnic state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s monarch under a rotating system.
Low at the time was an adviser and close associate of the then-king, he said.
The fund ran into problems over its Islamic bond issuance and the Cabinet “reluctantly” agreed to take over in 2009 to prevent embarrassment to the king and adverse impact on the country’s bond market, he said.
Najib, 66, didn’t say what Low’s role was after the takeover. He said Low “has shown himself to be a very influential figure in the Middle East” and could help draw investments for 1MDB.
He said the 1MDB directors remained the same and that it was 1MDB’s idea to form SRC in 2011. He said he wasn’t aware of company clauses giving him key power in SRC but that it wasn’t unusual in government-linked companies.
Najib denies any wrongdoing and accuses Malaysia’s new government of seeking political vengeance. His alliance’s shocking loss in May 2018 elections led to Malaysia’s first change of government since independence from Britain in 1957.
U.S. investigators say more than $4.5 billion stolen from 1MDB was laundered through layers of bank accounts in the U.S. and other countries to finance Hollywood films and buy hotels, a luxury yacht, art works, jewelry and other extravagances. More than $700 million from the fund allegedly landed in Najib’s bank account.
This is the first of five criminal cases against Najib over 1MDB corruption. His wife, several officials from his government, and the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs also face charges related to the scandal.
Najib’s defense will show he is also “a victim” of a scheme devised by Low and his cohorts, Najib’s lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters during lunch break Tuesday. Low bribed the management of 1MDB and SRC to do his bidding and kept Najib in the dark, the lawyer said.
Low is wanted in both Malaysia and the U.S. and currently in hiding,
Najib has shown he “has nothing to fear” by subjecting himself to cross-examination in the stand, Shafee added.
The patrician former leader, whose father and uncles were the country’s second and third prime ministers respectively, could face years in prison if convicted."
Smaller stocks gain on bigger players as 2019 closes,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/smaller-stocks-gain-bigger-players-2019-closes-67687855,"NEW YORK -- 
Small and mid-cap stocks haven't made quite as big gains this year as the larger indexes, but they could be poised for a breakout next year if the economy continues growing.
Small and midsize companies are typically more dependent on the domestic economy than larger companies. So, trading has been choppier for the smaller players in a year filled with trade tensions and economic angst. But worries about a potential recession have faded since midyear thanks to more positive reports on the economy and a supportive interest rate policy from the Federal Reserve.
Despite the volatility, both the Russell 2000 and S&P Mid Cap indexes have been close on the heels of larger counterparts like the S&P 500 throughout 2019, and could close more of that gap next year. 
Investors have focused mainly on larger stocks, especially through futures,  while small-cap stocks remain below their long-term average values and still have room to grow, according to Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a research report. 
“We are now seeing evidence that a catch up trade in Small Cap may truly be underway and that it has room to run,” she said.
Still, investors need to see continued improvement in productivity, income and spending for a larger shift toward small cap stocks to take hold, Calvasina said.
One positive sign she points to is a steeper yield curve, or the difference between long-term and short-term Treasury yields. During the summer, long-term yields fell below short-term yields, a phenomenon that’s seen as a predictor of recessions. But as of Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 1.83% versus 1.63% for the 2-year Treasury.
Job growth has been a key support for the economy and the latest government data blew away forecasts. Consumer confidence remains high and consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the economy, is still going strong. Those solid measures have offset concerns about a shrinking manufacturing sector and slower growth from services, which make up the bulk of the U.S. economy.
Economic growth is still expected to slow in the coming year. A survey from the National Association for Business Economics shows that they expect economic growth to slow from 2.9% last year to 2.3% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.
Small caps are at their steepest discount to larger stocks since 2003 and could take off in 2020 if the economy continues growing, according to Jill Carey Hall, U.S. equity strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. A resurgence from the manufacturing sector, for example, could reassure investors and give smaller stocks a lift.
Better forecasts from smaller companies also support a shift toward small cap stocks, she said. Utilities still remain the strongest sector for smaller stocks and provide a solid defensive hedge heading into 2020, she said. 
More cyclical small-cap sectors, including technology and industrial stocks, would particularly benefit from improvements in the larger economic picture that could nudge investors toward riskier holdings. "
Business economists see US slowing but avoiding recession,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/business-economists-us-slowing-avoiding-recession-67582333,"
The nation’s business economists expect U.S. economic growth to decelerate this year and next but for the economy to avoid stumbling into recession, extending a record-breaking expansion already in its 11th year.
The latest survey by 53 forecasters with the National Association for Business Economics shows that they expect economic growth to slow from 2.9% last year to 2.3% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. The forecasts are unchanged from the association’s previous survey in October.
The economists put the odds of a recession starting at 5% this year, 21% in the first half of 2020 and 43% by the end of next year.
However, they peg the odds of a recession by mid-2021 at 66%.
The American economy is likely to remain resilient this year and next, they say, despite risks arising from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and skirmishes with other U.S. trading partners: Half the respondents call trade tensions the No. 1 downside economic risk through the end of next year.
The Trump administration has slapped tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports and is scheduled to hit another $160 billion Dec. 15. China has retaliated by targeting $120 billion worth of American products.
The world’s two biggest economies are locked in a dispute over U.S. allegations that China deploys predatory tactics, including the outright theft of trade secrets, in an aggressive push to challenge U.S. technological dominance.
The Federal Reserve has lowered the short-term interest rate it controls three times this year. The cuts are meant in part to offset economic damage from Trump’s trade wars, which have raised uncertainty for businesses and contributed to a drop in business investment in the April-June and July-September quarters.
The vast majority of business economists — 94% — do not expect the Fed to cut interest rates again this year. But they are divided over what the central bank will do next year.
The economists expect American consumers to continue driving the economy. Consumer spending, which accounted for almost all U.S. economic growth from July through September, is expected to grow a healthy 2.6% this year and 2.4% in 2020."
Pelosi drug bill up for House vote reflects a Trump idea,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pelosi-drug-bill-house-vote-reflects-trump-idea-67686216,"WASHINGTON -- 
As a White House candidate, Donald Trump said he could save Medicare billions of dollars by negotiating prescription drug prices. 
Legislation expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House on Thursday would deliver that and much more.
But Trump's not on board, the White House is threatening a veto and Republicans who run the Senate say they will ignore the bill by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., because they say the government shouldn't negotiate drug prices.
That's not stopping Democrats from savoring the moment. They contend Trump's disapproval shows a lack of conviction behind some of his populist pitches. 
They're also betting that Pelosi's plan will prove popular with 2020 voters, helping elect Democrats who will eventually be in a position to pass something like it. 
The bill would cap drug copays and deductibles at $2,000 a year for Medicare recipients. It would use about $360 billion of its projected 10-year savings from lower drug costs to create Medicare coverage for dental care, hearing, and vision, filling major gaps for seniors.
“We were sent to Washington with a mandate to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and to deliver for the American people — this will untie the hands of the federal government to negotiate prices,” said Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., as debate got underway. She is a member of the freshman class that enabled Democrats to regain control of the House in 2018; her district went for Trump in 2016.
White House officials say Pelosi's bill is unworkable and that Trump wants something that can pass now. Near unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans means it would never clear the Senate.
Republican lawmakers predict Pelosi's bill would stifle innovation and they urged House Democrats to seek a bipartisan compromise.
“Drugs that save lives will not be around,” said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore. “Innovation goes on the rocks; lives will be lost.”
A major concern about the legislation is that it will result in fewer drugs coming to market. But there's debate about the extent. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates about 3% to 10% fewer new drugs, while the White House Council of Economic Advisers says it could be much higher, up to one-third of new medications.
Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who helped write the Pelosi bill, said Republicans predicting the drug pipeline will dry up are using scare tactics.
“Any drug that’s out there, we’re going to have access to,” he said. “The U.S. would still be the biggest market.”
The pharmaceutical industry is strongly opposed to the bill. Among the groups backing it is AARP.
High prescription drug prices consistently register in polls as the public's top health care concern. But it's unclear in a capital divided over Trump's impeachment that any major legislation will pass before next year's elections. 
There's a bipartisan Senate bill that would also cap seniors' out-of-pocket costs, at $3,100 a year, and require drugmakers to pay Medicare rebates if companies raise prices above inflation. The plan has Trump's support but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., hasn't said if or when he'll bring it to the floor. 
Inflation rebates are included in Pelosi's bill as well, so there is considerable overlap between the two major pieces of legislation before lawmakers. But Pelosi's measure goes further with several unique features, including:
— Medicare would be authorized to negotiate prices for costly medications, using a formula based on lower prices paid in other economically advanced countries. 
— Drugmakers who refuse to negotiate would be hit with steep sales taxes for the medication at issue. Republicans say proposed taxes as high as 95% are unconstitutional. The budget office projects that most pharmaceutical companies would opt to accept lower prices from Medicare.
— Private health insurance plans would be able to receive Medicare's discounted prices.
— Congressional budget experts estimate the price negotiations provisions of Pelosi's bill would save $456 billion over 10 years. After subtracting for new Medicare dental, hearing and vision coverage, that still leaves money to increase spending on medical research, community health centers, and countering the opioid epidemic.
Democrats have named the drug legislation after the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who early on sought to open a discussion with Trump on drug prices. Cummings, as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was a target of Trump outbursts on Twitter."
Democrats agree to North America trade pact: What's in it?,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/democrats-agree-north-america-trade-pact-67634685,"WASHINGTON -- 
After months of political wrangling, House Democrats agreed Tuesday to President Donald Trump’s revamped version of a 25-year-old North American free trade agreement. But they pried some concessions out of the Trump administration before saying they’d go along.
Tuesday’s         announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi probably clears the way for congressional approval of Trump’s U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, though pockets of resistance remain and powerful business lobbies said they still needed to study the details of the latest version.
With characteristic brio, the president took to Twitter to declare: “It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA.’’
More than anything, though, USMCA would just restore certainty to $1.4 billion worth of annual trade between the three countries more than two years after Trump began contentious negotiations on a new regional trade pact.
Some questions and answers about new agreement:
WHAT IS USMCA?
The pact is Trump’s replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994. NAFTA slashed tariffs and tore down most trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico, unleashing a burst of trade between the three countries.
U.S. farmers especially enjoyed increased access to their neighbors’ large markets. But NAFTA also encouraged U.S. manufacturers to move factories south of the border to take advantage of low-wage Mexican labor. Trump and other critics called NAFTA a job killer.
Supporters of the deal said it created a powerful regional bloc — a competitive counter to Europe and East Asia — with each NAFTA country taking advantage of its strengths: low-cost manufacturing in Mexico; and high-skilled labor and proximity to cutting-edge research and to customers in the United States and Canada.
Trump insisted on a revamped deal and threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he couldn’t get one he liked. Negotiations on a replacement began in August 2017. The three countries signed USMCA a year ago. Now Congress must ratify the deal.
HOW DOES USMCA CHANGE TRADE BETWEEN THE THREE COUNTRIES?
Trump’s version mostly continues to allow the free flow of trade across North American borders of the three countries. But it updates the pact to reflect the rise of e-commerce and other aspects of the digital economy that didn’t exist when NAFTA was negotiated.
For instance, USMCA allows U.S. companies to transfer data across borders without encountering discriminatory barriers. Jason Oxman, president of the tech trade group ITI, said the pact’s digital provisions set “a new and important precedent for modern trade rules.’’
DOES USMCA DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT U.S. MANUFACTURING JOBS?
Yes. To qualify for USMCA’s duty-free benefits, carmakers must get 75% of their automotive content from within North America — up from 62.5% under NAFTA. That means more content would have to be homegrown in higher-wage North America, not imported more cheaply from China and elsewhere.
At least 40% of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least $16 an hour. That would benefit the United States or Canada — not Mexico, where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount. The wage requirement is likely to push up the cost of cars built in North America.
Under USMCA, Mexico was required to formally authorize workers to form independent unions. Mexican unions had traditionally been co-opted by employers and the government and done little for workers. Laborers have been fired for trying to bargain on their own for better pay and working conditions. That is one reason Mexican wages remained so low -- and attractive to U.S. manufacturers aiming to cut costs.
WHAT CHANGES DID DEMOCRATS GET?
Democrats complained that the deal with Trump’s team shared a defect with the treaty it was supposed to replace and improve upon: It would be hard to enforce. In negotiations with Trump’s top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, the Democrats successfully pushed to strike language allowing countries or companies to avoid sanctions simply by refusing to participate in dispute-settlement panels.
They also insisted on closing loopholes that would have made it hard to enforce provisions protecting workers from intimidation and violence and on a committee that will monitor Mexico’s labor reforms.
The Democrats also won a significant concession from the administration on drug prices. Gone is what Democrats considered a giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry: a provision that offered expensive biologic drugs — which are made from living cells — 10 years of protection from cheaper knockoff competition.
“If you go back and look at trade agreements over the last 20 years, most of the verbiage deals with protection for pharmaceuticals,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, the Democratic chairman of the House trade subcommittee. “They have been the big winners and they got shut out in this agreement.”
WHAT WILL USMCA MEAN TO THE U.S. ECONOMY?
Probably not much. Trade is a relatively small part of the U.S. economy and trade with Mexico and Canada is smaller still. In an April analysis, the independent International Trade Commission calculated that USMCA would add 0.35% or $68 billion, to economic growth and generate 176,000 jobs over six years — blips in a $22 trillion economy with 152 million nonfarm jobs.
Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, dismissed USMCA’s economic benefits as “negligible.’’
“The intrinsic importance of the deal is not what it does to modernize NAFTA but rather what it prevents: a potentially disastrous breakdown of trade between the U.S. and its most important trading partners,’’ Daco wrote in a research note Tuesday.
IS EVERYBODY HAPPY WITH THE NEW AGREEMENT?
No. But USMCA still probably has enough support to clear Congress. In an unusual move, the top U.S. labor group — the AFL-CIO, which routinely opposes trade pacts — came out in favor of the worked-over USMCA.
But business groups want to take a closer look at the text. And some Republicans may balk at the concessions the administration made to win Democratic support.
“There are serious problems with this agreement,’’ Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey told reporters Tuesday.
Among other things, he objects to a so-called sunset provision that would end USMCA after 16 years unless the three countries agree to continue it and to the removal of the protection for biologic drugs.
Daniel Ujczo, a trade attorney with Dickinson Wright PLLC in Columbus, Ohio, said the concessions made to Democrats are likely to dampen the enthusiasm that businesses expressed while lobbying for the pact. “The business ‘wins’ that have been championed for the last year are now just a ‘whew’ we have relative certainty in North America,” Ujczo said.

The Latest: Activists in Madrid in garment industry protest,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/latest-pope-climate-change-challenges-civilization-67486732,"
The Latest on the U.N. Climate Talks in Madrid (all times local):
9 p.m.
Police say one person has been arrested after dozens of activists broke into a fashion store in central Madrid to protest about the garment industry’s impact on the environment.
In a live online video, the Extinction Rebellion group showed how a dozen activists used glue to attach their hands to the windows inside a Zara store, a brand owned by Spain’s fashion giant Inditex.
The protesters had signs reading “The Earth pays for fast fashion,” and “Green words, toxic truths.”
Police could be seen removing the activists one by one, as onlookers stopped to take photos.
Police said 37 protesters had their identities screened and that one was arrested for disobeying police orders.
Madrid is hosting a two-week global summit aimed at lessening the impact of rising temperatures.

1:10 p.m.
Social justice and environmental activists say they want a rally this week in Madrid to cap a year of massive marches demanding those in power take greater and fairer action against global warming.
“2019 has been the year of the awakening of civil society and the youth who have stood up to urge politicians and business heavyweights for more ambition against the climate emergency,” said Pablo Chamorro, a spokesman for March for Climate.
He added that “at least 100,000” people were expected to join Friday evening’s demonstration.
The march has been hastily organized in Madrid after a United Nations-sponsored global climate summit moved there from Chile. Activists will also hold a protest in the Chilean capital, Santiago.
The COP25 meeting aims to increase ambition among nations in averting the worst consequences of increasing temperatures.

Pope Francis is questioning if there’s the “far-sighted” political will to deal with climate change.
In a message to climate talks in Madrid, Francis called climate change a “challenge of civilization” for the common good. He adds that, “sadly,” awareness is still weak about the need to work tougher for “our common home.”
The Vatican made public on Wednesday the message by the pope, who has made caring for the environment a hallmark of his papacy.
Francis says that what’s needed is “clear, far-sighted and strong political will.” But he says “we must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will” to courageously allocate the “human, financial and technological” resources needed to mitigate climate change’s negative effects.
He says don’t let the remaining “window of opportunity” go unused.

12:05 p.m.
The European Union said Wednesday that it will likely miss its target for reducing greenhouse gases by 2030, dealing a blow to the bloc’s efforts to be a leader in the fight against climate change.
The European Environment Agency said existing measures put the EU on course to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming pollutants by 30% in the next decade compared with 1990 levels. Currently, the 28-nation bloc aims for a reduction of 40% by 2030, and some leaders have called for this target to be raised to 55%, with a long-term goal of ending virtually all new emissions by 2050.
The report was released as officials from almost 200 countries meet in Madrid for U.N. climate talks. The EU’s new executive Commission is expected to present its long-term plan for tackling global warming — dubbed the European Green Deal — next week.

French government raises retirement age as strikes grind on,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/french-government-raises-retirement-age-strikes-grind-67653330,"PARIS -- 
France's prime minister said Wednesday the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government is trying to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing huge public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject government proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after over 300,000 protested across France, authorities measured a log-jam of some 460 kilometers (285 miles) of traffic in Paris. All metro lines bar two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, who they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension reforms in a speech on Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French “will need to work longer.”
It was rich in detail. People born after 1974 will have to work until the age of 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected in any way, he said, throwing out a sweetener. 
The leader of the prominent CGT workers' union, Philippe Martinez, flatly rejected the new plans.
“The government is making fun of everyone,” he said. Several other unions including Workers' Force, said the prime minister's address only “confirms the necessity to step up the strike action.”
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules for all.
Philippe said the changes would ensure the pension system is “fair and sustainable"" in the face of a growing population with, a record number of people over 90. 
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term. The government also introduced the country's first ever minimum pension, which will be available to those who worked their whole life, at a relatively high 1,000 euros ($1,100) per month. That compares with 858 euros (723 pounds) a month in the U.K. 
Beginning under Macron's watch, it will be harder for the law to be undone by a successive president but late enough in his mandate to avert protracted political harm.
The plans though seem to have done little to abate the strikes that were billed as “unlimited” and threatened to mirror similar ones in 1995 that caused the ousting of Prime Minister Alain Juppe. That action paralyzed the country with widespread public support and were themselves compared to the events of May 1968, when France reached the brink of revolution.
Many French people and the unions leading the strikes fear the new system will force people to work longer for smaller pension allocations. 
Amid all the political speeches, the strikes continue to cripple the eurozone's second-largest economy and the mood among the public remains strained but understanding."
Boeing tries to reassure airline industry leaders about Max,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/boeing-reassure-airline-industry-leaders-max-67529647,"
Boeing is reassuring airline industry leaders about the safety of the grounded 737 Max as it continues working to get the plane back in service.
The aircraft maker invited about 30 union officials, safety experts and others to the Seattle area for two days of meetings with Boeing executives and factory tours.
The event shows how motivated Boeing is to get the Max back in the air quickly, says Lori Bassani, president of the union that represents American Airlines flight attendants.
Bassani said Thursday that Boeing gave no new details on how soon it expects regulatory approval of changes it is making to the Max after two crashes that killed 346 people.
Reporters were not allowed at the event, which wrapped up Wednesday. Guests included former Federal Aviation Administration chief Randy Babbitt. The participants heard from CEO Dennis Muilenburg, other Boeing executives and test pilots.
Boeing hopes to enlist pilots and flight attendants in its effort to convince the public that the plane will be safe after changes are made to flight-control software that was implicated in the crashes. 
“I have had a few (flight attendants) come up to me and say, 'Please don't make me get on that plane,'” Bassani said. She isn't sure how widespread that fear is — the union has not surveyed its members.
Two other unions that represent flight attendants at other carriers also attended the event. Pilot unions were not invited, although they have attended previous Boeing meetings on the Max and taken turns in a flight simulator.
Airlines can't fly their Max jets — even without passengers — without special permission from the FAA, but they are taking some steps to prepare the planes for service. 
American Airlines has 16 Max jets in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and eight in Roswell, New Mexico. Crews run the engines every few days and taxi the planes on the ground, but don't take them up in the air.
American, Southwest and United have removed the Max from their schedules into early March. 
Last month, Boeing came up with a checklist before the Max can fly. It is currently performing tests with airline pilots to measure their response to emergencies this week. Among the remaining items are a certification flight with the FAA, and FAA approval of updated pilot training for the Max. "

The U.S. tech giant’s political ad archive carried an         apparent listing for the ad, with a message that the video is “no longer available due to a claim by the BBC.”
The listing said the ad was shown up to 1 million times.

US stocks open higher as central banks stand pat on rates,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-stocks-open-higher-central-banks-stand-pat-67685682,"NEW YORK -- 
Stocks are opening higher on Wall Street after the European Central Bank said it would leave interest rates unchanged and as traders look for signs of progress in trade talks between the US and China. Another optimistic tweet from President Donald Trump had traders hopeful a deal was getting closer. An election in Britain Thursday adds to the uncertainties during a busy news week. The S&P 500 rose 16 points, or 0.5%, to 3,157. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 132 points, or 0.5%, to 28,040. The Nasdaq rose 33 points, or 0.4%, to 8,687. Bond prices fell, sending yields higher. 
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Global shares were mixed Thursday after central banks in Europe and the U.S. said they will leave interest rates unchanged for the time being.
Investors are still waiting for a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks while monitoring Britain's national election Thursday, which will likely determine if the United Kingdom pushes ahead with its departure from the 28-nation European Union. 
Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to 7,252, while France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were both flat in midday trading in Europe.
Pre-market trading on Wall Street was rudderless, with Dow and S&P futures drifting between small losses and gains. 
The European Central Bank left its key interest rate benchmarks and stimulus programs unchanged on Thursday during ts first policy meeting under newly appointed president, Christine Lagarde.
That follows a similar decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which also signaled it would leave them alone through 2020.
The Fed had been expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged this month after cutting it three times this year to shield the economy from slowing global growth and the fallout of U.S. trade conflicts.
Investor jitters over whether the U.S. and China will be able to avert a new escalation in their trade war has made for choppy trading this week, pulling major indexes lower.
Investors are hoping that both sides can avoid a new round of tariffs scheduled to kick in Sunday on Chinese goods that include phones, laptops and other popular products.
“The fact is the big event risk remains in place, with the world watching to see if the 15% tariffs kick in on $160 billion of Chinese exports on Sunday,"" Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a commentary.

Concerned EU weighs response to Turkey-Libya border deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eu-weighs-response-turkey-libya-maritime-border-deal-67591499,"
The European Union's top diplomat said Monday that some EU countries are concerned over Turkey's controversial maritime border agreement with Libya but that the bloc will continue studying the deal before deciding whether to take action.
The maritime deal, endorsed by the Turkish parliament last week, has fueled tensions in Turkey’s long-running dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
The deal could give Turkey access to a contested economic zone across the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.
“It’s clear that it is problematic. It poses major concerns to certain member states, in particular Greece and Cyprus,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters after chairing a meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels.
Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, which lie between Turkey and Libya geographically, have blasted the accord as being contrary to international law.
Borrell declined to say that the agreement breaks the law, but he said that ""we are going to be studying this question very closely, being clear that any agreement must respect international law.”
Some of Greece and Cyprus's partners were unequivocal.
“The Netherlands is always a staunch supporter of the rule of international law, and we side with Greece,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok. ""International law should be upheld.”
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said “it’s a little bit astounding how they split up the Mediterranean among themselves. We’ll have to see how we deal with it.”
Although they are NATO allies, neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old rows, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.
In Cairo, parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Al warned that “Egypt will not stand idle by while a foreign country is threatening its interests,"" according to the official MENA news agency.
“Anyone who approaches the maritime, air, and land borders of Egypt should review himself. We will not accept or allow any mess at or close to our borders,"" he was quoted as saying, in reference to Turkey.

Google co-founders step down as execs of parent Alphabet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/google-founders-step-execs-parent-alphabet-67472608,"
The co-founders of Google are stepping down as executives of its parent company, Alphabet, ending a remarkable two decades during which Larry Page and Sergey Brin shaped a startup born in a Silicon Valley garage into one of the largest, most powerful — and, increasingly, most feared — companies in the world.
Sundar Pichai, who has been leading Google as CEO for more than four years, will take on additional duties as Alphabet’s CEO, the         position held by Page. The company isn’t filling Brin’s position as president.
Page and Brin started Google soon after they met as Stanford University graduate students in 1995.
What began as a way to catalog the growing internet has now become         one of the most influential companies in the world. Google dominates online search and digital advertising and makes the world’s most widely used operating system for smartphones, Android. It's hard to make it through a whole day without using one of Google's services — ranging from online tools to email, cloud computing systems, phones and smart speaker hardware.
Yet Google has been facing pressure from privacy advocates over its collection and use of personal information to target advertising. It also faces allegations that it abuses its dominance in search and online advertising to push out rivals.
Google is the subject of antitrust inquiries from Congress, the Department of Justice and a contingency of states in the U.S. and from European authorities. The company has also faced harsh criticism about the material on its services. Its video streaming business, YouTube,         was fined $170 million to settle allegations it improperly collected personal data on children without their parents' consent.
Longtime tech analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies doesn't expect much to change with the executive shuffle. And if anything does, he said, it will be due to government regulation.
Pichai assured employees in an internal email that his new job wouldn't mean he was taking a step back from Google.
""I want to be clear that this transition won't affect the Alphabet structure or the work we do day to day,"" he wrote. ""I will continue to be very focused on Google and the deep work we’re doing to push the boundaries of computing and build a more helpful Google for everyone.""
Alphabet — an umbrella corporation that the two created in 2015 — still boasts Google as its central fixture and key moneymaker. But it's also made up of what are known as ""other bets,"" or longshot projects. That includes drone company Wing and self-driving car firm Waymo.
Page and Brin, in announcing the news Tuesday, said the company has ""evolved and matured"" in the two decades since its founding. Both promised to stay active as board members and shareholders.
""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,""         they wrote in a blog post.
Page and Brin, both 46, both have been noticeably absent from Google events in the past year. Both stopped making appearances at the weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees, and Page didn't attend this summer's Alphabet shareholders meeting even though he was still in the CEO role.
Alphabet has been positioning Pichai as the de facto leader for quite some time. It has made him the top executive voice at shareholders meetings, on earnings call and as a spokesman at congressional hearings.
Pichai, 47, has worked at the company for 15 years, serving as a leader in projects to build Google’s Chrome browser and overseeing Android. Pichai, who has an engineering background, took over as the head of Google's products before being promoted to CEO when Alphabet was created. Pichai is known as a soft-spoken and respected manager.
Last year, Google raised hackles in Congress by refusing to send Page or Pichai to a hearing on Russian manipulation of internet services to sway U.S. elections. Congressional officials left an empty chair while top executives from Facebook and Twitter appeared. Offended lawmakers derided Google as “arrogant.”
Although Bajarin said he doesn’t believe Brin and Page are leaving “because the fire is getting hotter,” he said Pichai's role at Google has been preparing him for the increased government scrutiny.
Brin and         Page still hold a majority of voting shares of Alphabet. According to a regulatory filing in April, Page holds 42.9% of the company's Class B shares and 26.1% of its voting power. Brin holds 41.3% of the Class B shares and 25.2% of the voting power. According to Forbes magazine, Page has a net worth of $52.4 billion and Brin $56.8 billion.
""Keep in mind, they are not losing their title as billionaires, but they are changing their roles,"" Bajarin said.
Google's stock increased less than 1% in after-hours trading after the news was announced.
Google's longest serving CEO is still Eric Schmidt, the former executive brought into the role in 2001 as a so-called ""adult supervisor"" for Brin and Page. Schmidt stepped into the position as the company's board worried about the relative inexperience of Brin and Page to manage the growing company. He remained CEO until 2011, when         Page once again became chief executive. Schmidt stayed on the board until this year.
Page grew up in Michigan, where his late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos.

World shares mixed on reports Trump might delay tariff hike,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stocks-open-lower-wall-street-ahead-us-tariff-67625457,"BEIJING -- 
Global markets were mixed Wednesday following reports that President Donald Trump's advisers were preparing for a possible delay in a weekend tariff hike on Chinese goods. Investors also had their eyes on central bank meetings in Europe and the U.S.
The German index in Frankfurt rose in early trading while Shanghai and Hong Kong closed higher. Markets in London and Tokyo declined while Wall Street futures were subdued.
Investors were counting on Trump to postpone Sunday's duty increase on $160 billion of Chinese imports. But with no official action, Wall Street fell for a second day Tuesday.
The Wall Street Journal and other outlets reported Trump's advisers were preparing to postpone punitive duties on smartphones, laptop computers, toys and other goods. But they said the president had yet to decide.
“Markets hope that the tariff can is kicked down the road while talks are underway,” said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report. However, he warned, such hopes are “tentative if not fragile” with no commitment from Trump.
London’s FTSE 100 retreated 0.1% to 7,206, while France’s CAC 40 was flat to slightly up at 5,846. Frankfurt’s DAX added 0.3% to 13,113. 
Premarket trading was uneven on Wall Street, with futures for the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index up slightly at 3,137, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 0.1% to 27,896. Both declined 0.1% on Tuesday.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 2,924.42 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.8% to 26,645.43. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 shed less than 0.1% to 23,391.86.
South Korea's Kospi gained 0.4% to 2,105.62 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.7% to 6,752.60. India's Sensex gained 0.1% to 40,292.15. Taiwan and Singapore advanced while New Zealand retreated.
Investors are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday on interest rates and a similar decision Thursday by the European Central Bank.
Both are expected to affirm a commitment to low rates to support economic growth.
Elsewhere, markets are watching Britain's parliamentary election Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the election two years before it was required in hopes of a gaining a majority in the House of Commons to support his plan to leave the European Union by the end of January whether or not the two sides have negotiated details of their future relations.
The biggest risk for stocks has been the U.S.-Chinese tariff fight over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus. It has weighed on global commerce and threatens to depress economic growth.
On Tuesday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House announced a revised trade deal with Mexico and Canada. The deal would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement and would offer more provisions for U.S. workers. 
ARAMCO DEBUTS: Saudi Arabia's oil company Aramco gained 10% in its first moments on the stock market Wednesday in a dramatic debut that pushed its value to $1.88 trillion, surpassing Apple as the largest listed company in the world. Trading on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange came after a mammoth $25.6 billion initial public offering that set the record as the biggest ever in history, overtaking the $25 billion raised by China's Alibaba in 2014. Aramco, owned by the state, has sold a 1.5% stake in the company, pricing its shares before trading at 32 Saudi riyals, or $8.53. Shares closed at $9.39.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 35 cents to $58.89 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 22 cents on Tuesday to $59.24. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 46 cents to $63.88. It added 9 cents the previous session to $64.34.
CURRENCY: The dollar held at Tuesday's 108.74 yen. The euro declined to $1.1079 from $1.1091."
T-Mobile and Sprint 'megamerger' goes to trial,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trial-begins-state-ags-lawsuit-mobile-sprint-megamerger/story?id=67598013,"
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he is ""confident that the law is on our side"" as he leads a coalition of states suing to block T-Mobile and Sprint from merging into one of the nation's largest wireless carriers in a consequential trial that got underway Monday.

The lawsuit from 14 state attorneys general, and the District of Columbia, led by California and New York, is one of the last hurdles T-Mobile must face before it can proceed with buying Sprint for $26 billion, and cutting the number of telecom giants in the nation from four to three.
""It’s hard to believe that going from a market with four big competitors to a market with three big companies will provide the amount of competition that keeps the playing field fair for consumers,"" Becerra said in a press call Monday.

""The more choices we have, the more options we have to get the best, highest quality product at a fair price,"" he added, calling it ""common sense.""

Becerra argued the merger would hurt ""particularly those who can afford it least -- working Americans who continue to live on tight budgets.""

""We’re very confident that the law is on our side,"" he said. ""The T-Mobile-Sprint megamerger would leave consumers with fewer choices and higher prices.""
In October, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve the merger, and the Justice Department gave it the green light with conditions in July.

FCC chairman Ajit Pai formally endorsed the merger in August, saying in his recommendation for approval that it would advance 5G, the next-generation of wireless services, across the U.S.

""After one of the most exhaustive merger reviews in Commission history, the evidence conclusively demonstrates that this transaction will bring fast 5G wireless service to many more Americans and help close the digital divide in rural areas,"" Pai said in a statement.

Pai also argued that ""the merger will promote robust competition in mobile broadband, put critical mid-band spectrum to use, and bring new competition to the fixed broadband market.""
Still, the state AGs argue that reduced competition will hurt consumers, and will especially impact consumers from lower-income and minority communities.

New York Attorney General Letitia James argued in a statement announcing the lawsuit in June that the merger ""would particularly affect lower-income and minority communities here in New York and in urban areas across the country.""

The current market is comprised of four major players: T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. Sprint and T-Mobile have high market shares among low-income populations, according to Becerra's office.

If combined, they would dominate the market for prepaid mobile services, which do not require a credit check, thus hurting the low-income populations that may rely on this service, his office argued.
The DOJ decided in July that T-Mobile and Sprint must divest from Sprint’s prepaid business as part of the merger.

""The megamerger of T-Mobile and Sprint would reduce competition in the mobile marketplace and be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation,"" James said in a statement to ABC News Monday. ""We simply must protect consumers from unchecked corporate dominance and make sure competition in the marketplace yields better outcomes for cell phone customers and workers alike.""

Sprint declined ABC News' request for comment Monday. T-Mobile did not immediately respond to request for comment Monday.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere has previously argued that the merger will ""create a bigger and bolder competitor than ever before -- one that will deliver the most transformative 5G network in the country, lower prices, better quality, unmatched value and thousands of jobs,"" in a statement.

Sprint's executive chairman Marcelo Claure previously referred to the day the merger received Justice Department clearance in July as ""an important day for our country and, most important, American consumers and businesses.""

""We plan to build one of the world’s most advanced 5G networks, which will massively revolutionize the way consumers and businesses use their connected devices to enhance their daily lives,"" Claure added. "
Fed leaves low rates alone and foresees no moves in 2020,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/fed-leaves-low-rates-foresees-moves-2020-67664353,"WASHINGTON -- 
Chairman Jerome Powell made clear Wednesday that the Federal Reserve is prepared to keep its benchmark interest rate very low through at least next year — and possibly longer. 
Fueling that expectation is the growing belief of Fed officials that inflation will remain tame even as the economy keeps growing modestly and the job market remains solid. The lowest unemployment rate in a half-century — 3.5% — won't necessarily fan high inflation as it might have in the past, Powell suggested at a news conference.
On Wednesday, the Fed left its key short-term rate in a low range of 1.5% to 1.75% after having reduced it three times this year. Powell had previously characterized those rate cuts as “insurance” that would offset the drags from the U.S.-China trade war and global slowdown. But on Wednesday, he boldly suggested that the Fed wouldn't likely reverse those cuts for the foreseeable future. 
“Inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50 year lows and expected to remain there,” Powell said at his news conference. “We have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.”
In a further sign of its confidence, the Fed's latest policy statement dropped a phrase it had previously used that referred to “uncertainties” surrounding the economic outlook. This change suggested that the Fed is now less worried about economic risks from the trade fights or global slowdown.
With the Fed's key rate likely to stay where it is, consumers interested in buying a home or car should continue to enjoy low borrowing costs. Businesses will likely also enjoy lower interest rates. Savers, though, will struggle to earn a return above the inflation rate.
Powell signaled that persistently low inflation is allowing the Fed to pursue low interest rate, or “accommodative,” policies to sustain the 11-year economic expansion and try to create the conditions for more people to find jobs. 
“Even though we are at 3½% unemployment, there is actually more slack out there in a sense,” Powell said. “And the risks of using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that, are relatively low.”
The chairman expressed optimism about the economy and satisfaction that the Fed's rate cuts this year may have helped prolong growth. 
“Both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place,” he said.
Many analysts note, though, that the economy faces threats from the trade conflicts, a stumbling manufacturing sector and cutbacks in business investment. Some say the Fed may feel compelled to cut rates at least once next year. 
Still, in updated forecasts the Fed issued Wednesday, no officials penciled in a rate cut in 2020. Instead, four Fed officials said they expected a rate increase next year. The remaining 13 officials projected no change to rates.
“If I were Powell, I would say I have things exactly where I want them,” said David Jones, an economist and author of five books on the Fed. “Despite all the people who criticized Powell for not easing sooner or not easing more, it looks like this mid-course correction of three rate cuts was almost perfect in keeping the economy growing on a sustained basis.”
For now, the chairman has managed to draw his colleagues on the Fed's policymaking committee fully into his corner. No Fed officials dissented from Wednesday's decision to keep rates unchanged — the first time in five meetings that a vote was unanimous.
Powell has suggested that this year's rate cuts have helped lower mortgage rates and spurred growth in home purchases. Auto sales have also remained healthy as more Americans have borrowed to buy cars. 
Still, Powell's satisfaction with the Fed's policies comes after the central bank executed a U-turn this year. The Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate four times in 2018 after growth began the year at a healthy pace. But as the trade conflicts intensified, the stock market fell at year's end and inflation slowed rather than picked up as expected, the Fed reversed course and cut rates three times. 
“Toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense that the economy was growing at around 3%, and it didn't,” he said. “I didn't expect to face the challenges, but I think we did face them, and I'm pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did.
Fed policymakers have been weighing their options to stabilize short-term lending in money markets. In late September, overnight lending markets seized up, and banks and other financial institutions struggled to find short-term loans. This problem briefly lifted the Fed's benchmark rate out of its target range. 
Powell said that the Fed's efforts to boost banks' cash reserves by purchasing Treasury bills and its own short-term lending have been effective. 
“For the last couple of months, (short-term lending) markets have been functioning well,” he said. 
In the longer run, Powell said that the Fed is considering “fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes"" to financial regulations to make it easier for large banks to provide short-term loans.

US added 266K jobs in November,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-added-266k-jobs-november-unemployment-remains-50/story?id=67542550,"
The U.S. economy added a solid 266,000 jobs in November, exceeding economists' exceptions by nearly 80,000 jobs, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday.

Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents to $28.29 and unemployment remained at a 50-year low of 3.5%.

The data indicates the economy has continued to remain stable in the U.S. over the past year despite escalating trade tensions and other potential threats.
Employers added the most jobs in the health care (an increase of 45,000 jobs) and professional and technical services industries (which saw an increase of 31,000 jobs).
November also saw a rise in manufacturing jobs though this was likely due to unionized autoworkers returning to work after the strike at General Motors. The previous month saw a decline of 43,000 jobs in manufacturing, also likely due to the strike.

The average work week remained unchanged in November at 34.4 hours a week. In manufacturing, however, the average work week increased slightly, by 0.1 hours, to 40.5 hours a week, as overtime decreased by 0.1 hours.

An average of 180,000 jobs have been added per month so far in 2019 compared to an average gain of 223,000 in 2018. Friday's report also revised September's and October's figures to indicate 41,000 more jobs were added than previously reported.

Paris police arrest scores amid strike over pension reform,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mass-strike-pensions-tangles-transport-france-67511427,"
Paris police fired tear gas at demonstrators Thursday as the Eiffel Tower shut down, France’s high-speed trains came to a standstill and hundreds of thousands marched nationwide in a strike over the government’s plan to overhaul the retirement system.
At least 90 people were arrested in Paris by evening as the protests wound down.
Police said 65,000 people took to the streets of the French capital, and over 800,000 nationwide in often-tense demonstrations aimed at forcing President Emmanuel Macron to abandon pension reform.
The open-ended walkout by the country’s unions represents the biggest challenge to Macron since the yellow vest movement against economic inequality erupted a year ago.
Opponents fear the changes to how and when workers can retire will         threaten the hard-fought French way of life. Macron himself remained “calm and determined” to push it through, according to a top presidential official.
In Paris, small groups of masked activists smashed store windows, set fires and hurled flares on the sidelines of a march that was otherwise peaceful. Demonstrators also shot firecrackers at police in body armor. Some journalists were mugged in the street.
The Louvre closed some of its galleries, and the Palace of Versailles shut down. Subway stations across Paris closed their gates, high-speed TGV trains canceled their runs, and nearly 20% of flights at Paris’ Orly Airport were reported grounded.
Many visitors, including the U.S. energy secretary, canceled plans to travel to one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations.
Some travelers showed support for the striking workers. Others complained about being embroiled in someone else’s fight.
""I had no idea about the strike happening, and I was waiting for two hours in the airport for the train to arrive, and it didn't arrive,” said vacationer Ian Crossen, from New York. ""I feel a little bit frustrated. And I've spent a lot of money. I've spent money I didn't need to, apparently.”
Beneath the Eiffel Tower, tourists from Thailand, Canada and Spain echoed those sentiments.
Paris authorities barricaded the presidential palace and deployed 6,000 police officers. Police ordered all businesses, cafes and restaurants in the area to close and detained 71 people before the demonstration even started.
Authorities banned protests in the more sensitive neighborhoods around the Champs-Elysees avenue, the presidential palace, Parliament and Notre Dame Cathedral.
Health workers showed up to decry conditions in hospitals. Students pointed to recent student suicides and demanded government action. Environmentalists emphasized that climate justice and social justice are one and the same.
And young and old roundly condemned the new retirement plan, which they fear would take money out of their pockets and reduce the leisure period the French expect have come to expect in the last decades of their lives.
Skirmishes broke out between police firing tear gas and protesters throwing flares in the western city of Nantes, and thousands of red-vested union activists marched through cities from Marseille on the Mediterranean to Lille in the north.
Lacking public transportation, commuters used shared bikes or electric scooters despite near-freezing temperatures. Many people in the Paris region worked from home or took a day off to stay with their children, since 78% of teachers in the capital went on strike.
The big question is how long the walkout will last. Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said she expects the travel troubles to be just as bad on Friday, and unions said they will maintain the Paris subway strike at least through Monday.
Joseph Kakou, who works an overnight security shift in western Paris, walked an hour to get to his home on the eastern side of town.
“It doesn’t please us to walk. It doesn’t please us to have to strike,” he said. “But we are obliged to, because we can’t work until 90 years old.”
The deeply unpopular Macron is expected to reveal the details of his plan next week. The government has promised not to touch the official retirement age — 62, though lower for certain physically demanding occupations — but the plan will encourage some people to work longer.
To Macron, the retirement reform         is central to his plan to transform France so it can compete globally in the 21st century. The government argues France’s 42 retirement systems need streamlining.

Google has taken down a U.K. Conservative Party ad on YouTube that used BBC news footage, days after Facebook took similar action on grounds that it infringed intellectual property rights.
The BBC has complained about the ad, saying it used material featuring some of its journalists that was taken out of context and could damage its reputation for impartiality.
The U.S. tech giant’s political ad archive carried an         apparent listing for the ad, with a message that the video is “no longer available due to a claim by the BBC.”
The listing said the ad was shown up to 1 million times.

Tensions as yellow vests join French retirement protests,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tensions-yellow-vests-join-french-retirement-protests-67569252,"
Paris police skirmished Saturday with yellow vest activists who joined a wave of protests against the government's overhaul of France's retirement system, as highway blockades and train stoppages by other protesters disrupted weekend travel around the country.
A few thousand yellow vest protesters marched from the Finance Ministry complex on the Seine River through southeast Paris, pushing their year-old demands for economic fairness — and adding the retirement reform to their list of grievances. Most marchers were peaceful but some threw projectiles or pushed riot officers, prompting repeated bursts of tear gas from police.
The marchers appear to be emboldened by the         biggest national demonstrations in years  Thursday that kicked off a mass strike-and-protest movement against President Emmanuel Macron's redesign of the pension system.
As the strikes entered a third day Saturday, tourists and shoppers faced shuttered subway lines around Paris and near-empty train stations.
Truckers striking over a fuel tax hike disrupted traffic on highways from Provence in the southeast to Normandy in the northwest. A similar fuel tax is what unleashed the yellow vest movement a year ago, and this convergence of grievances could pose a         major new threat to Macron's presidency.     
Macron says the reform, which will streamline a convoluted system of 42 special pension plans, will make the national pension system more fair and financially sustainable. The government says it won't raise the official retirement age of 62 but the plan is expected to including financial conditions to encourage people to work longer. Those most against the changes are workers in special categories like transport who can now retire earlier than 62.
So far the travel chaos is not deterring the government. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe plainly told the French in a nationwide address Friday: “You're going to have to work longer.”
He will present details of the plan next week. Philippe did offer one olive branch, saying the changes would be progressive so that they don't become “brutal.”
Unions, however, see the plan as a         threat to workers' rights and are digging in for a protracted strike. They also plan new nationwide retirement protests Tuesday.
Emmanuel Buquet, an unemployed 51-year-old from Rouen, said the mass protests gave a new impetus to the waning yellow vest movement.
“Yellow vests are back out in the streets,” he told the AP. “It’s getting worse and worse. We’ve obtained nothing since last year, just crumbs. The reforms are getting stronger and stronger.”
In a society accustomed to strikes, many people have supported the protests, although that sentiment is likely to fade if the French transport shutdown continues through next week.
“I knew it was going to last ... but I did not expect it to be that chaotic,"" Ley Basaki, who lives in the Paris suburb of Villemomble and commutes to work in the capital, told The Associated Press on Saturday at the Gare de l'Est train station. “There is absolutely nothing here, nothing, nothing. There is no bus, nothing.”
Many travelers were using technology and social networks to find ways around the transport strike — working from home, using ride-sharing apps and riding shared bikes or electric scooters.
But some were using technology to support the strike. A group of activist gamers was raising money via a marathon session on the game-streaming site Twitch. Their manifesto says: “In the face of powers-that-be who are hardening their line and the economic insecurity that is intensifying,"" they are trying to ""occupy other spaces for mobilization and invent other ways of joining the movement.”

Czech leader to face fraud charges after decision overturned,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/czech-leader-face-fraud-charges-decision-overturned-67493006,"
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis faces charges again over an alleged $2 million fraud involving European Union subsidies after the country’s chief prosecutor overturned a previous decision to drop the case.
Prosecutor General Pavel Zeman announced the move Wednesday after evaluating a September finding to dismiss the charges despite a police recommendation to indict Babis.
Zeman said that was done “against the law and prematurely.”
“At this point, we don’t have enough evidence to press or drop the charges,” Zeman said.
Babis, a populist billionaire, repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
“I haven’t done anything illegal,” he said on Wednesday.
The case involves a farm known as the Stork's Nest that received EU subsidies after its ownership was transferred from the Babis-owned Agrofert conglomerate of around 250 companies to members of Babis' family.
They were also facing the charges but Zeman upheld the decision to dismiss them in their case.
“It’s a relief for the family,” Babis said.
The subsidies were meant for medium-sized and small businesses and Agrofert would not have been eligible for them. Later, Agrofert again took ownership of the farm.
Agrofert later returned the subsidy.
It is not immediately clear when the prosecution might finish the re-evaluation of the case.
The charges caused serious complications for Babis. After he won the 2017 parliamentary election, he faced a difficult task to form a government because other parties in Parliament were reluctant to enter a coalition with his centrist ANO movement.
He finally created a coalition with the leftist Social Democrats that has support from the Communists, a controversial move that gave the far-left party an indirect share of power for the first time since the anti-Communist 1989 Velvet Revolution.
Massive street protests, unseen from 1989, against Babis took place in Prague and across the country earlier this year.
Separately, a European Union report in recent days concluded that Babis might have had a conflict of interest over EU subsidies involving his former business empire, according to local media.
The European Commission has not published the result of its audit because the procedure has not been completed.
Babis again denies wrongdoing."
Uber weighs next steps after jarring sex assault report,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uber-weighs-steps-jarring-sex-assault-report-67554565,"
A day after Uber revealed that more than 3,000 riders and drivers were sexually assaulted last year while using its service, attention is turning to what's next for the ride-hailing giant and whether its plans to improve safety go far enough.
Uber's report was hailed by victims' rights organizations for taking a step that other companies have so far been unwilling to match. But it's unclear whether the transparency will help rebuild trust or backfire by showing customers how deep Uber's safety problems go.
In the safety report, Uber said 464 people were raped while using its services in 2017 and 2018. Almost all of them — 99.4% — were riders. It's difficult to compare those statistics to other modes of transportation, because U.S. taxi companies and transit agencies generally do not collect similar national data.
Even so, many said the report shows Uber has work to do.
“This is a major crisis situation that they're going to have to deal with because the brand's built on safety, and even though some could try to say it's a small number, it's still way too high — it's higher than zero — and I think that shows a gap in their screening process,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. The revelations give “meat on the bones” to regulators, including those in London who chose not to renew Uber's license over safety issues, he said.
Uber has been working to improve safety over the last two years, rolling out features including an in-app emergency button, a ride-check feature that detects unexpected stops or crashes and the ability for riders or drivers to share their location with loved ones during a ride. The company outlined additional safety steps it will take in the report.
On Monday, Uber plans to launch in seven cities a feature to give riders a four-digit number that they can use to verify that they are getting into the right car. Next year, it plans to launch a survivor support hotline staffed by RAINN, a sexual violence organization, and to provide sexual misconduct education for drivers. The hotline may encourage more victims to report attacks.
The report only covers Uber's U.S. operations. The U.S. and Canada brought in 63% of Uber's revenue last quarter. Lyft said it would release its own safety report, but it has not indicated when.
Critics say Uber should be doing more, particularly with background checks, to weed out potentially dangerous drivers. Unlike many taxi companies, Uber and its main U.S. rival, Lyft, do not check drivers' fingerprints against a national database.
The gold standard for background checks is fingerprinting “because someone can easily fake a Social Security number,"" said Dominique Penson, an attorney who has represented sexual assault victims. “You can't fake a fingerprint. And if somebody has been convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States, that will appear in a national database, and when you run that fingerprint, you'll know.""
Uber says the FBI has acknowledged its database is incomplete and does not always include a final disposition. The company's process includes a motor vehicle screening, a criminal background check and ongoing notifications about any new offenses.
An added fingerprint check could add precious time to the driver-approval process at a time when both Uber and Lyft are fiercely competing for market share. 
Dashboard cameras also could help by recording incidents and serving as a deterrent for bad behavior, said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. Campbell encourages drivers to get cameras, but the ride-hailing companies have not encouraged the practice.
“Even if you have dashcam footage, it's hard to get Uber and Lyft to actually look at the footage,"" Campbell said.
Last month, Uber announced it would allow passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico to record audio of their rides.
A U.S. House committee is looking at legislation that could reduce the number of sex assaults involving ride-hailing passengers and drivers, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said Friday.
The committee has discussed requiring fingerprint background checks, camera monitoring and front license plates for ride-hailing cars in states that don’t have them. This would help prevent fake ride-hailing drivers from picking up passengers by making it easier for passengers to check plate numbers against the ones provided by Uber and Lyft, DeFazio said.
In Eugene, Oregon, fingerprint checks earlier this year by the local police department found about two dozen Uber and Lyft drivers had criminal records that were missed in the companies’ checks, DeFazio said. One was a convicted murderer, while another was a registered sex offender, according to The Register-Guard newspaper. The city stopped the people from driving for the companies.
There may be limits on what federal legislators can do. Ride-hailing companies could be regulated federally because they conduct interstate commerce, but that is new legal territory, he said.
Still, he applauded Uber’s report, saying the company had done more than any of its competitors “by just reporting,"" DeFazio said. “There’s more to be done, for sure.”
The report raised alarm among some riders.
“I think I've taken it a little bit for granted, the fact that the app already tracks who I am and where I'm at,"" said Mary Yao, 28, an MBA student at U.C. Berkeley. “I think I'll be more conscientious next time I climb into a car to not always be on my phone. So it has made me raise my awareness a little bit.”
Bryant Greening, an attorney and co-founder of LegalRideshare, a Chicago law firm that specializes in ride-sharing cases, noted that more than 40% percent of the reported sexual assaults, which include incidents less serious than rape, were against drivers, who also are at risk.
“There’s no more dangerous place to be than in a moving car with a stranger,” Greening said. “You are really vulnerable without a clear path to escape. So this system, rideshare, needs to be made safe for everybody who is in that car.”

GM lends $40M to startup buying closed Ohio plant,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gm-lending-40m-startup-company-buying-closed-ohio-67607286,"
General Motors has agreed to loan $40 million to a newly formed company that wants to make electric pickup trucks at a massive Ohio assembly plant GM shut down earlier this year.
The agreement between the two companies also would allow GM to buy back the plant up until next May, documents filed last week show. The amount available would be more than enough to cover the $20 million price tag for the plant.
Lordstown Motors Corp. announced a month ago that it had bought the the         once-bustling factory near Youngstown that made the Chevrolet Cruze up until last March.
The new company wants to begin making electric trucks by late 2020, but it also said that it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM's decision to end production in Lordstown, where it employed 4,500 two years ago, came into the political spotlight after President Donald Trump criticized the plan last year and pushed GM executives to either reopen or sell the plant, At one point, he threatened to cut off all federal subsidies to the automaker.
GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company wants to help Lordstown Motors stick to its launch schedule and that the company does not expect it would buy the plant back, nor is it an investor in Lordstown Motors. 
“It's in everyone's best interest in seeing this succeed,"" he said. 
The loan agreement, first reported by the         The Business Journal in Youngstown, also would give GM the chance to lease land next to the Lordstown plant. 
GM announced last week that it has formed a joint venture with Korea's LG Chem to build an electric vehicle battery cell factory at undisclosed location near Lordstown. 
The new battery plant will create more than 1,100 jobs, but the exact location hasn't been disclosed.
Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, plans to hire 400 production workers next year so that it can begin limited production of its electric trucks.

"Global carbon pollution continues to rise, but more slowly",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/global-carbon-pollution-continues-rise-slowly-67476205,"
The world continues to increase the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide it pumps into the air, but it’s not rising as fast as in the previous couple years.
Led by big jumps from China and India, the world is projected to spew 40.57 billion tons (36.8 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air in 2019. That's up nearly 255 million tons (231 million metric tons) from 2018, according to two scientific studies released Tuesday. The studies by          Global Carbon Project, a group of international scientists who track emissions, show a 0.6% increase from last year.
In previous years, global carbon dioxide emissions grew by 2.1% and 1.5% after a few years in the mid 2010s when global emissions barely rose, according to the studies in         Environmental Research Letters. Carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas has caused         1.8 degrees of warming  (1 degree Celsius) since pre-industrial times and world leaders are meeting in Madrid to try to limit warming to another 1.8 degrees from now.
“Emissions grew more slowly than last year but we still set a global record. It’s hard to be upbeat about that,” said study co-author Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. “The U.S. National Academy of Sciences sounded the alarm on carbon and climate 40 years ago. Since then, global carbon dioxide emissions have doubled, and the world is hurtling towards catastrophic climate change.”
The 2019 estimate is based on data through the first nine to ten months of the year, with a few national estimates based only on six months of data, said co-author Glen Peters, a climate scientist in Norway. Past projections have proven pretty accurate, he said.
That means every second this year people put 2.57 million pounds of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. That's the equivalent weight of two Airbus A380s, the world's largest passenger airliner, going into the air every second.
Both the United States and the European Union saw emissions drop 1.7% from 2018 to 2019, but China saw a 2.6% increase and India had a 1.8% rise. China is by far the biggest carbon polluter, with 28% of the 2019 emissions. The United States is No. 2 at 14.5%.
“Generally, I think this is bad news. Not terrible news, but bad news,” said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn’t part of the report. “A stronger switch from coal to solar or wind needs to happen to reach low climate targets.”
Led by 10% drops in both the United States and Europe, carbon pollution from coal dropped worldwide nearly 1% but increased 2.6% from cleaner natural gas, according to the studies. Coal still is the No. 1 source of man-made carbon pollution putting 16 billion tons (14.6 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air this year, followed by oil and then gas. Coal generally emits 76%         more carbon dioxide  than natural gas to produce the same amount of energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“I don’t think we have completely seen the end of coal yet, but it is certainly in the death throes,” Peters said. “Though, I would imagine a slow and protracted decline of coal because of the young infrastructure in Asia.”
But with coal dropping or even just plateauing, it is now apparent that the world is not quite on the worst-case scenario carbon emissions path of the four charted by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Peters said. But the next two highest emission scenarios, which the world is closer to, are not “pleasant worlds to live in,” he said.
Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn’t part of the study, called the numbers grim: “Stepping back and looking at 30 years of data, there is nothing at all that reveals any reason to be optimistic that the world is about to turn the corner on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.”
The United States, which is in the early part of a year-long process of pulling out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, has reduced its carbon dioxide pollution by 9.7% between 2000 and 2018, Jackson calculated. Critics of the Paris agreement said the U.S. is the world leader in reducing emissions, but Jackson’s numbers show 11 other nations have had bigger percentage cutbacks this century.
From 2000 to 2018, the United Kingdom has cut its carbon pollution by about one-third, Greece and Italy cut their emissions by more than 28%. At the same time, China’s carbon pollution has tripled and India’s has increased by 157%.
“The numbers show that the U.S. is not leading in terms of overall emissions reductions and this proves that we could be doing better,” said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck. “This highlights that more, not less, U.S. international leadership is urgently needed. I’m still hopeful we can turn this all around... If we don’t, the planet is cooked.”

Driving in 2030? What will that be like?,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/driving-2030-experts-offer-clues/story?id=67375709,"
Your car, unfortunately, will not fly a la ""The Jetsons"" in the next decade.

It will, however, likely be a crossover SUV that still requires a human driver. That Uber or Lyft ride? Expect an autonomous vehicle to pick you up in certain cities. Keys, like manual transmissions, will fade into oblivion. Gasoline refineries will still be in business but charging stations for electric vehicles will become more prevalent, experts say.

The next 10 years for the automobile could look very similar to the decade we're about to close out -- or radically different, depending on tech innovations, government regulations and new players in the highly competitive industry.

Here's what some longtime experts are predicting for drivers and automakers alike.

Mobility

Cellphones are expected to supplant the key fob and be able to remotely start a vehicle, lock it and locate its parked location, similar to what can be found now in Lincolns and Hyundais. This technology will go from niche to ubiquitous, according to Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Cox Automotive.

""The industry is on the cusp of incredibly exciting things,"" he said. ""Drivers will have the ability to connect to the car even when they're not near it. The car will be a rolling piece of information.""
Electrification

Electric vehicles will still face challenges in the market but they’ll become more common on the road than they are now.

""They won't be the majority of vehicles sold in the U.S. in 10 years,"" said Brauer. ""Electric vehicles do not make sense in a lot of areas. But we will see viable options for driving a longer distance in these cars.""
Brandon Mason, director and U.S. mobility leader at PwC, expects mass adoption of electric vehicles will take place before driverless cars go mainstream. Pure EVs account for 1% of the U.S. market now. That number could rise to 10% in the next decade, he said.

""Automakers are making big bets on EVs,"" he explained. ""There's a significant amount of capital in EVs now. But we won't see an inflection point until the middle of the next decade. Battery packs are still cost-prohibitive.""

China and Europe will continue to lead the way in electrification from a regulatory standpoint, according to Mark Wakefield, automotive analyst and managing director at Alix Partners.
Like Mason, Wakefield forecasts EVs to account for 10% of the U.S. auto market by 2030.

""No one is doubting this is the future, but the question is how long"" before EVs are widespread, he said.
Hybrids will no longer be ""special"" but rather the status quo in the coming decade, said Eric Tingwall, print director at Car and Driver magazine.

""Some form of electric propulsion will be in all new vehicles sold,"" he noted, adding that EVs could make up an even bigger portion of the market -- 20% -- by the end of 2030.
Autonomous vehicles

Self-driving cars could replace taxis and ride-sharing vehicles in urban cities, Brauer said.

Like electric vehicles, high costs are another hurdle for automakers to overcome with autonomous vehicles, Mason pointed out. Vehicles with level four and five autonomy will arrive by 2030 at the earliest, he said.

""There's several hundred thousand dollars of technology in each of these vehicles,"" he said. ""I don't see private ownership of self-driving cars happening for the foreseeable future.""
Steering wheels and pedals are not going away in the next decade and young people will still be required to pass driving tests, according to Tingwall. But autonomous systems will be more ""capable and confident,"" he said.

""Change is happening very quickly in the auto industry,"" he said. The timelines for a lot of this technology, however, are ""ambitious,"" he added.

Newer systems will allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road -- but only in certain conditions, like highway driving, he said.

""There will be some type of advanced cruise control,"" he said. ""You can watch YouTube videos and check social media.""
Wakefield said he cannot wait for the day when cars will be able to drive themselves to dealers for maintenance or be summoned by owners in a parking lot.

""A car in 2030 will be able to do so many more things for you,"" he said. ""2020 cars will look like relics.""

A shrinking industry?

Brauer anticipates smaller, independent marques will be acquired by industry giants. China will likely continue its buying streak, adding to its portfolio of brands.

""Could China own General Motors in 10 years? It's not out of the question,"" he said.

Consolidation in the automotive market could accelerate, Mason agreed. But the impact on drivers may be modest.

""If the number of nameplates is reduced, it's not necessarily a bad thing for consumers,"" he said. ""There will still be plenty of options for consumers.""

He added, ""I see a lot of disruption in the industry over the next decade.""

Sales slowdown

Tingwall expects new car sales to dip as transaction prices rise.

""Anybody looking for an affordable vehicle will be in a crossover,"" he said. ""We'll see a middle class that doesn't have the purchasing power to buy a new car. The market will shrink for new vehicles.""

Subscription services will also gain in popularity as fewer new cars are purchased.

""They'll be like a lease, but for a shorter term,"" he explained.

Automakers, in an effort to cut costs, will team up to share vehicle platforms and powertrains, partnerships that exist currently between Ford and Volkswagen and Ford and Rivian, Tingwall said. Third parties in Asia will build these platforms, homogenizing the parts under the car's hood. But not all automakers may survive the next decade.

""If there is an economic downturn, the industry will be squeezed,"" he said. ""We will certainly lose a few niche, high-end automakers.""
Wakefield forecasts auto sales to stay strong in the coming years, but a downturn in the market ""will come.""

The market ""is cyclical,"" he explained, noting that sales could drop to 15 million annual units from the recent trend of 17 million units.

""We won't stay at 15 million for years. It will recover,"" he said.

Crossovers will be the vehicle du jour for drivers in the next decade, further cementing the demise of the sedan.

""CUVs will be dominant and what everyone will be driving,"" Wakefield said.  "
"Uber reports more than 3,000 sexual assaults on 2018 rides",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uber-reports-3000-sexual-assaults-2018-rides-67538865,"
Uber, as part of a         long anticipated safety report, revealed that more than 3,000 sexual assaults were reported during its U.S. rides in 2018.
That figure includes 235 rapes across the company's 1.3 billion rides last year. The ride-hailing company noted that drivers and riders were both attacked and that some assaults occurred between riders.
The Thursday report, which the company hailed as the first of its kind, provides a rare look into the traffic deaths, murders and reported sexual assaults that took place during billions of rides arranged in the U.S. using Uber's service. It is part of the company's effort to be more transparent after years of criticism over its safety record.
In 2017, the company counted 2,936 reported sexual assaults — including 229 rapes — during 1 billion U.S. trips. Uber bases its numbers on reports from riders and drivers, meaning the actual numbers could be much higher. Sexual assaults commonly go unreported.
“I suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they’re still too common,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi         tweeted about the report. “Some people will appreciate how much we’ve done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right.”
Uber's share price dropped more than 1% in after-hours trading.
Uber and competitor Lyft have faced harsh criticism for not doing enough to protect the safety of their riders and drivers. Dozens of women are suing Lyft, claiming the company should have done more to protect them from driver assaults. A Connecticut woman         sued Uber last month, claiming she was sexually assaulted by her driver.
London         refused to renew Uber's license to operate in the city in November after the company was plagued with safety issues including concerns about impostor drivers. Uber said it will appeal the decision.
The companies have both formed partnerships with sexual assault prevention networks and other safety groups, and have touted their background check policies for drivers. But many say they haven't gone far enough to protect passengers and drivers, who are contract workers for the companies.
“Keeping this information in the dark doesn’t make anyone safer,” Uber said in a statement announcing the report. It plans to release its safety report every two years going forward.
Lyft said last year it would also release a safety report. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that it ""remained committed"" to releasing a report, but did not say when it would be released.
Mike Bomberger, a lawyer representing more than 100 victims of sexual assault in lawsuits against Uber and Lyft, applauded Uber for releasing the numbers. “One of the problems with both of these companies is that they have hidden and have tried to conceal the number of sexual assaults that occur in their vehicles,” he said.
In response, an Uber spokesperson pointed to the just-released report. Lyft called Bomberger's charge “baseless.”
Bomberger said he believes 80% to 90% of the assaults in the Uber report could have been prevented by measures such as cameras in the cars recording rides and the companies reporting every assault they learn of to the police.
The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said it appreciated Uber's transparency.
""This is an issue that affects every institution in America,"" RAINN press secretary Emily Robinson said in a statement. She added that organizations in every industry, including education, should ""make a similar effort to track and analyze sexual misconduct within their communities.”
The report stated that Uber rides were involved in 97 reported crashes in 2017 and 2018, resulting in 107 deaths. The company said the figure represents about half of the national rate for fatal crashes.
Sexual assault in the report is defined broadly into categories including non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part, attempted non-consensual sexual penetration, non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, non-consensual kissing of a sexual body part and non-consensual sexual penetration.
The company also said Uber rides were involved in nine murders during 2018, and 10 during 2017. Uber noted that the vast majority — 99.9% — of its rides had no reported safety issues.

Huawei moving US research center to Canada,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/huawei-moving-us-research-center-canada-67456044,"
The founder of Huawei says the Chinese tech giant is moving its U.S. research center to Canada due to American sanctions on the company.
In an interview with Toronto’s Global and Mail newspaper, Ren Zhengfei said the move was necessary because Huawei would be blocked from interacting with U.S. employees.
Huawei Technologies Ltd. is the No. 2 global smartphone brand and the biggest maker of network gear for phone carriers. U.S. authorities say the company is a security risk, which Huawei denies, and announced curbs in May on its access to American components and technology.
The Trump administration announced a 90-day reprieve on some sales to Huawei. The government said that would apply to components and technology needed to support wireless networks in rural areas.
Ren gave no details but Huawei confirmed in June it had cut 600 jobs at its Silicon Valley research center in Santa Clara, California, leaving about 250 employees. A Huawei spokesman said the company had no further comment.
“The research and development center will move from the United States, and Canada will be the center,” Ren said in a video excerpt of the interview on the Globe and Mail website. “According to the U.S. ban, we couldn’t communicate with, call, email or contact our own employees in the United States.”
Huawei, China’s first global tech brand, is scrambling to preserve its business in the face of possible loss of access to U.S. components, which threatens to damage its smartphone business.
Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, also operates research and development centers in Germany, India, Sweden and Turkey.
In November, Huawei started selling a folding smartphone, the Mate X, made without U.S.-supplied processor chips or Google apps. The company also has unveiled its own smartphone operating system it says can replace Google’s Android if necessary."
FAA analysis predicted many more Max crashes without a fix,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/faa-analysis-predicted-max-crashes-fix-67662029,"
After the first crash of a Boeing 737 Max last year, federal safety officials estimated that there could be 15 more fatal crashes of the Max over the next few decades if Boeing didn’t fix a critical automated flight-control system.
Yet the Federal Aviation Administration did not ground the plane until a second deadly crash five months later.
The FAA analysis was disclosed Wednesday during a hearing of the House Transportation Committee, which is investigating the FAA’s oversight of Boeing and the Max. 
“Despite its own calculations, the FAA rolled the dice on the safety of the traveling public and let the Max continue to fly until Boeing could overhaul its MCAS software,” said Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., chairman of the committee.
MCAS is the name of Boeing's flight-control system that automatically pushed the noses of the doomed planes down in response to faulty readings from a sensor.
FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson declined to call the agency's decision not to immediately ground the plane a mistake. Instead, the FAA and Boeing issued notices reminding pilots how to handle a nose-down pitch of their plane.
“Obviously the result is not satisfactory,” Dickson said. “The decision did not achieve the result that it needed to achieve.”
The FAA concluded that more than 2,900 people could die in Max crashes over 45 years without the software fix. It assumed the fleet would eventually grow to 4,800 planes. Fewer than 400 were flying before they were grounded in March, after the second crash. And it estimated Boeing could fix MCAS software in about seven months.
The analysis was completed several weeks after the FAA had already issued the emergency notice to pilots — the agency took no additional steps after estimating 15 future crashes.
An FAA spokesman said the analysis is one of several tools the agency uses to analyze safety issues.
A Boeing spokesman said the company's response to the first crash was ""fully consistent with the FAA's analysis and established process.""
Dickson said that as Boeing seeks to return the Max to flying, his agency is controlling the process and won't delegate any of that authority to Boeing.
Dickson defended the safety record of U.S. aviation while saying “what we have done in the past and what we are doing now will not be good enough in the future.”
A retired Boeing production manager told the lawmakers about “alarming” conditions at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, where two Max planes that crashed were built. 
The manager, Edward Pierson, said the assembly line fell far behind schedule by mid-2018 because of cascading problems that began with late delivery of key parts. There weren't enough mechanics and other workers, he said. Yet Boeing went ahead with its plan to boost production from 47 to 52 planes a month.
“By June 2018, I had grown gravely concerned that Boeing was prioritizing production speed over quality and safety,” Pierson said in prepared remarks. “I witnessed a factory in chaos and reported serious concerns about production quality to senior Boeing leadership months before the first crash” and again before the second crash.
Pierson said he told his bosses at Boeing that they should shut down the assembly line to deal with safety and quality-control issues, but no action was taken. Executives didn’t mention the problems in financial reports.
Pierson, who retired last year, said he wrote to Dickson and other officials. He said he has been interviewed by the Justice Department — it is conducting a criminal investigation of Boeing — but the FAA never responded. Earl Lawrence, the FAA's executive director of aircraft certification, said the agency is investigating and has interviewed Renton production workers.
Boeing hopes airlines will be able to use the plane again early next year after the company completes fixes to flight-control software and computers. Dickson has insisted that the FAA has no timetable for granting that approval. 
DeFazio praised Dickson's recent comments but was harshly critical of the agency and Boeing.
The FAA “failed to do its job. It failed to provide the regulatory oversight necessary to ensure the safety of the flying public,” DeFazio said.
Published reports indicate that FAA officials knew very little about MCAS, which has been implicated in the October 2018 crash of a Max off the coast of Indonesia and the March 2019 crash of another Max in Ethiopia. In both crashes, investigators say, a faulty sensor caused MCAS to push the nose of the plane down and pilots were unable to regain control. In all, 346 people died.
Regulators around the world grounded the plane after the second crash.
Several relatives of passengers who died in the crashes attended Wednesday's hearing.
Dickson suggested that FAA will not delegate key review work to Boeing this time.
“The FAA fully controls the approvals process for the flight control systems and is not delegating anything to Boeing,"" Dickson said in his written testimony. “The FAA will retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all new 737 Max airplanes manufactured since the grounding.”
He said the plane will only return to flying after all safety issues have been addressed and pilots have received enough training to fly the plane safely. 
DeFazio and other lawmakers have indicated they may offer legislation to overhaul the way the FAA certifies new aircraft. Dickson said that the FAA can do better, but the safety record of U.S. aviation — no deadly crashes of a U.S. airliner since 2009 — shows that the FAA's oversight is working.
“The system is not broken,” he said."

Workers fired from Google plan federal labor complaint,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/workers-fired-google-plan-federal-labor-complaint-67466668,"
Four workers fired from Google last week are planning to file a federal labor complaint against the company, claiming it unfairly retaliated against them for organizing workers around social causes.
The former employees said Tuesday they are preparing to file unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board this week. All four were fired Nov. 25 for what Google said were violations of its data security policy.
Company officials wrote in a memo — without confirming the employees’ names — that the four were “searching for, accessing, and distributing business information outside the scope of their jobs.”
But the four workers — Laurence Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers and Paul Duke — say they believe they did not violate company policies and claim that Google is using the alleged violations as an excuse to terminate them for labor activity.
“This is an expression of Google’s management power,” Duke said. “They are scared of worker power.”
Google disputes that they fired the employees for organizing activity.
“No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company’s activities,” the company said in a statement.
Google employees are known for being some of the most outspoken across the tech industry. Thousands of employees         walked out of work last year to protest the company’s handling of sexual misconduct claims, in what became known as the Google Walkout. Since then, employees have petitioned for better benefits for contract workers, successfully argued for the         end of mandatory arbitration and have opposed Google’s involvement in some government projects.
The company has also been known for an open, collaborative work culture since its early days, one that employee activists say is now getting closed off.
CEO Sundar Pichai’s weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees became monthly meetings. Google also updated its community guidelines to tell employees to avoid “disrupting the workday” to debate politics or other topics. Some workers complain both moves were meant to discourage open speech and crack down on employee pushback.
Waldman and Duke helped create a petition earlier this year that called for Google to         refrain from bidding on a cloud computing contract with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Nearly 1,500 employees signed the petition, which said CBP had “engaged in human rights abuses” at the southern border and that Google should not work with the agency.
Rivers and Berland also helped spread the petition, and Berland has been involved in organizing other campaigns at the company, including those involving LGBTQ rights.
All four say they were questioned by Google officials in the past few months for sharing or accessing internal documents. Two say they were placed on administrative leave last month.
The company said it found one worker set up notifications to be alerted about other employees’ calendar changes, which made those employees feel unsafe. It said screenshots of their calendars with their names were shared externally.
“We have always taken information security very seriously, and will not tolerate efforts to intimidate Googlers or undermine their work, nor actions that lead to the leak of sensitive business or customer information,” read the memo sent by Chris Rackow, Royal Hansen and Heather Adkins from the company’s security and investigations team.
The employees said any documents they viewed and shared were already accessible by Google workers, and they only shared them internally. They said others later shared them outside the company.
The four fired workers said they received no severance payments. They are working with lawyers and have not yet determined the details of the NLRB complaint, but said it will address retaliation concerns and will likely take issue broadly with Google’s recent policy changes and alleged crackdowns against employee organizing.
Google reached a         separate settlement with the NLRB in September over employees’ ability to speak out about workplace issues. Google agreed to post notices to remind employees of their rights, including the ability to talk to each other about workplace conditions and push for changes such as raises.
The situation of the four workers has led to additional protest. A few hundred people attended a rally at Google’s San Francisco office in November to call for Rivers’ and Berland’s reinstatement."
Stocks slip as investors weigh outlook for US-China trade,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/european-shares-fall-asia-advances-wall-street-rally-67591287,"
Stock markets weakened during European trading on Monday as investors weighed the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on China and the outlook for negotiations on the trade dispute. 
A Chinese official said that Beijing wants a prompt settlement of its trade war with Washington as another U.S. tariff hike on $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Sunday. China announced Friday it was carrying out a promise to waive punitive tariffs on American soybeans and pork. 
France's CAC 40 slipped 0.4% in midday trading to 5,850, while Germany's DAX declined 0.2% to 13,145. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.1% to 7,232. 
U.S. shares were set to drift slightly lower with Dow and S&P 500 futures both falling less than 0.1%.
In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.3% higher to finish at 23,430.70, after the Cabinet Office reported the economy expanded at a 1.8% annual pace in July-September, spurred by strong consumer purchases ahead of an Oct. 1 sales tax hike. That was much stronger than the 0.2% growth earlier reported and marked a fourth straight quarter of expansion for the world's No. 3 economy.
Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added  0.3% to 6,730.00. S outh Korea's Kospi edged 0.3% higher to 2,088.65. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed, inching down to 26,494.73.  The Shanghai Composite index rose nearly 0.1% to 2,914.48.
The week got off to a strong start after the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 300 points on Friday, while the S&P 500 erased losses from earlier in the week, nudging the benchmark index to a second consecutive weekly gain.
A surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report for November put investors in a buying mood Friday on Wall Street, extending the market’s winning streak to a third day.
The Labor Department said employers added 266,000 positions, well above estimates of 184,000. The report also showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low. Separately, an index that measures how consumers feel about the economy showed an increase from last month.
In energy markets, the benchmark for crude oil lost 56 cents to $58.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It advanced 77 cents to $59.20 per barrel on Friday. Brent crude oil, the international standard for pricing, shed 59 cents to $63.80. 
In currencies, the dollar fell to 108.47 Japanese yen from 108.59 yen on Friday. The euro strengthened  to $1.1077 from $1.1062."
"Democrats, DeVos clash in fiery hearing that turned personal",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/democrats-devos-clash-fiery-hearing-turned-personal-67700817,"
House Democrats clashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in a Thursday hearing that nearly spun out of control when one lawmaker called DeVos “the most unpopular person in our government"" and said she's “out to destroy public education.”
DeVos was facing the House’s education committee to explain her overhaul of a federal program that erases loans for students who are cheated by their colleges. Some Democrats believe DeVos intentionally stalled the program for more than a year while she rewrote the rules and made it more difficult for students to get loan relief.
Several Democratic lawmakers had taken turns criticizing DeVos' handling of the program when it turned personal. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., said DeVos is the first political opponent she has encountered who is “out to destroy public education.”
“When you approach a public school, you are protested. When you enter, you are booed,” Wilson said. “You are the most unpopular person in our government. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president.”
DeVos did not immediately respond, but the remark drew quick condemnation from Republicans. Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking Republican, interrupted to call the comment “absolutely over the line,” saying it would not have been allowed on the House floor. Another Republican tried unsuccessfully to get the remarks removed from the record.
After the hearing, the Education Department issued a statement calling the hearing “a cheap political show trial designed to personally attack and denigrate the Secretary of Education.”
“It was unprofessional, it was outside of the rules of the House, and it set a terrible example for America’s young students who watched those shameless attacks. Our nation’s elected leaders should do better,” spokeswoman Angela Morabito said.
After the chamber settled, lawmakers returned to the original topic and questioned DeVos for more than an hour more. Republicans applauded her work while Democrats blasted her handling of the program, which has become a central dispute in her ongoing feud with the party.
The program, known as borrower defense to repayment, is meant to forgive federal loans for students whose colleges misrepresent the quality of their education or otherwise commit fraud.
It was expanded under the Obama administration to help clear loans for thousands of students who attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit college chain that collapsed in 2015 amid allegations that it lied about the success of its graduates in order to get students to enroll.
Soon after, thousands of additional claims were coming from students who attended other for-profit colleges, including defunct chains such as ITT Technical College. But after the Trump administration took office, the process ground to a halt. Loans were no longer being discharged, and a pool of 60,000 pending claims ballooned to more than 200,000.
Democrats have been seeking answers about the backlog for more than a year but say the Education Department has refused to cooperate. DeVos agreed last month to face the House education committee after Democrats threatened to issue a congressional subpoena forcing her appearance.
At the hearing, DeVos shifted much of the blame to the Obama administration. She said she inherited thousands of pending claims and no clear guidance on how to process them. Her predecessors had simply been approving all claims of fraud, she said, leaving it to her to devise a fair way to judge applications.
“Yes, there is a backlog of borrower defense claims,” DeVos said. “To say that I am frustrated by that is an understatement. But rather than focus on why there is a backlog, too many have instead focused on creating more chaos and a circus-like atmosphere.”
Earlier this week, DeVos unveiled a new method for judging claims that she says will help clear the backlog. It's meant to provide varying levels of loan forgiveness based on the degree of financial harm a student suffers.
Full forgiveness will be granted only to students from programs that produce graduates with median incomes far below their peers in other similar programs. Other defrauded students can get 25% to 75% of their debt erased, depending on the median income of the program they attended.
It’s a departure from the Obama administration, which provided full loan relief in all cases of fraud, and it drew outrage from Democrats, who said it’s based on flawed statistical methods that will leave many cheated students repaying some portion of their loans.
“Those defrauded borrowers have been left with mountains of debt, worthless degrees and none of the job opportunities they were promised,” Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House education committee, said Thursday. “Defrauded borrowers have been cheated twice: First by their college, and then by a Department of Education that refuses to make them whole.""
DeVos said she disagrees with opponents who want to give “blanket forgiveness for just anyone who raises their hand and files a claim.” She said many applications are based on allegations so dubious that “your jaw would drop if you actually read"" the reasoning.
Republicans backed DeVos through the hearing, saying she’s making sure taxpayers only cover students’ college debt if they were actually financially harmed. Foxx said the accusations that DeVos purposefully delayed relief are unfair.
“Secretary DeVos is putting reforms in place that will help defrauded students navigate the process of getting the loan relief they deserve,"" Foxx said. “Committee Republicans are supportive of these efforts.”

Official: China hopes for US trade pact as tariff hike nears,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/official-china-hopes-us-trade-pact-tariff-hike-67591882,"
A Chinese official says Beijing wants a prompt settlement of its trade war with Washington. 
A deputy commerce minister said Monday that Beijing wants “satisfactory results as soon as possible.” The official gave no details of talks on a “Phase 1"" deal announced by President Donald Trump in October. 
Another U.S. tariff hike on $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Sunday. China announced Friday it was carrying out a promise to waive punitive tariffs on American soybeans and pork. 
Trump alarmed global financial markets last week when he said he might be willing to wait until after next year's presidential election to reach a settlement. "
"Amid scandal, UAW leaders name Rory Gamble as president",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amid-scandal-uaw-leaders-rory-gamble-acting-president-67518381,"
Members of the United Auto Workers executive board have voted to appoint Rory Gamble as the union's new president.
He will serve the remainder of former President Gary Jones' term, which runs until the union’s convention in June of 2022.
Jones stepped down last month after being implicated in a widening embezzlement and bribery scandal at the union. He has not been charged with any crimes, but his Detroit-area home was raided by federal authorities last summer.
Gamble, 64, was a vice president who successfully led negotiations this year on a new contract with Ford Motor Co. Before that, he served as director of a regional office near Detroit. He was named acting president when Jones stepped down.
“This wasn’t planned, and it is a tall order,” Gamble said in a statement. “I promise one thing: when I retire and turn over this office, we will deliver a clean union on solid footing.”
The union’s International Executive Board voted unanimously for Gamble Thursday at a meeting in the Detroit suburb of Southfield,  UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said.
Ten people with ties to the UAW have been charged in the corruption investigation. Eight have pleaded guilty, including two former vice presidents and the widow of another. Separately, three people who worked at Fiat Chrysler have been convicted. 
Gamble had been acting president of the union for about three weeks, and has imposed additional financial controls and other measures to stop or root out corruption. 
The union has been in a crisis for months since authorities raided Jones' home and the home of former President Dennis Williams in an investigation that began in 2015.
Top union officials have been accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars through regional conferences that were held in Palm Springs, California. Vance Pearson, the former head of a region in St. Louis, has been charged in the case. Jones was president of the region before Pearson.
Jones' lawyer has said that all expenses were submitted in detail and were not questioned by UAW accounting department or the executive board. 
Former Vice President Joe Ashton, who also served on the General Motors board, pleaded guilty Wednesday, admitting he received $250,000 in kickbacks after arranging a contract for 58,000 watches paid for by the General Motors-UAW joint training center.
Other union officials were charged in a bribery scheme involving payments from the Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center that were made to keep them “fat, dumb and happy,” according to court records. 
As acting president, Gamble added an ethics officer to handle corruption allegations. He and Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry have replaced the 400,000-member union's auditing firm, added four internal auditors and hired a big accounting firm to study its financial controls in an effort to prevent corruption. 
The scandal brought a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler filed by General Motors. The lawsuit alleges that Fiat Chrysler bribed union officials to get a labor cost advantage over GM. Fiat Chrysler has said the lawsuit is without merit. 
The union's executive board will appoint a new vice president to handle Ford at a meeting in January. "
Financial fraud more fraught when perpetrator is known,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/financial-fraud-fraught-perpetrator-67498249,"
When it comes to identity theft and other financial fraud, the perpetrator is sometimes close to home. 
While people worry about having their identity or money stolen by strangers online, family, friends and acquaintances are increasingly the ones stealing and profiting from personal information, according to one survey. This creates a tricky and potentially expensive situation for victims to resolve. 
Experts say theft by a family member or acquaintance is vastly underreported. 
The National Crime Victimization Survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2016 found that just 6% of all victims of identity theft knew something about the offender. But another more recent report by Javelin Research & Strategy, which surveyed 5,000 adults, found that the number of victims who knew the offender in cases of identity theft spiked to 15% in 2018 from 7% in 2017. Because victims were hesitant to report the crime, about three-quarters of these victims personally bore all or some liability for the fraud that occurred. 
Experts said that victims generally do not report the fraud because they don’t want to get friends or family in trouble with the law or cause personal rifts. They often feel some shame and embarrassment that it occurred. And in some cases — such as with children or the elderly — they may be unaware or reliant upon the perpetrator. 
Axton Betz-Hamilton is an authority on the topic — both personally and professionally. 
Growing up, Betz-Hamilton watched her parents struggle unsuccessfully for years to resolve cases of identity theft. At 19, she discovered that her own identity had been stolen years earlier. It took Betz-Hamilton about eight years to straighten out her credit report.
The cruelest twist came  after her mother’s death in 2013, when she and her father discovered that her mother had been the culprit — taking an estimated $600,000 combined from Betz-Hamilton, her father and grandfather through various misdeeds. 
She has turned the formidable experience into a career. Betz -Hamilton is now an assistant professor of consumer affairs at South Dakota State University, where she focuses on issues such as family financial abuse, child identity theft and elderly financial exploitation. 
She also wrote a book “The Less People Know About Us” about her personal experience. 
Since the book’s publication earlier this year, Betz-Hamilton has heard from other victims around the globe — some with stories more extreme than hers. In many cases involving other forms of abuse. 
Still, Betz-Hamilton and other experts say many fraud victims are ashamed to come forward. 
“It is exceptionally underreported,” said Charity Lacey, spokeswoman for the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that focuses on supporting victims. 
“There are all these justifications that can happen on the part of the victim as to why they will allow that known perpetrator identity crime to happen,” she said. 
Here are a few ways you help prevent or recover from familiar fraud: 
PREVENTION
It pays to protect yourself in some of the ways you would from any identity theft. 
Freeze your credit, which restricts access to your credit file. It’s free, easy and will essentially halt someone from opening any new credit in your name. 
While you are at it, freeze your children’s credit too and urge elderly loved ones to do the same. Experts say children and the elderly are often targeted because they’re vulnerable and the activity goes undetected. It’s not just family but friends and acquaintances who take advantage of access to personal information. 
Store personal information and documents such as Social Security cards, passports and birth certificates in a safe place. Shred sensitive documents and keep information on electronic devices protected. Monitor your credit reports regularly for any unusual activity. 
Vet anyone who may be in your home regularly — such as caregivers or other service providers. Don’t leave personal information out — such as bank statements — if you are expecting others in your home. 
Be selective about who you trust to maintain your finances in old age or in disability. Consider putting checks and balances in place with a financial professional or multiple trusted people as a safeguard to keep each in check. 
RECOGNIZE
Keep an eye out for signs of fraudulent activity. 
Review your bank and credit card statements closely. Look out for signs of new account activity — this could include bills for items you didn’t buy, debt collection calls for or denial for loan applications. Credit card applications arriving in the mail for a minor are another giveaway. 
Pay close attention if an elderly loved one is  reliant on others for their care as this is when they are most susceptible. Look out for changes in financial activity or activity they cannot explain. Additionally, take note if items are missing from their home. Also notice if a caregiver shows a change in lifestyle — quitting a job or buying big ticket items for instance. 
Javelin Strategy & Research found that fraud cases show an uptick around economic downturns as people grow desperate. 
Kyle Marchini, who co-authored the firm’s report on identity theft, refers to need as one corner of a “fraud triangle,” with opportunity and rationalization as the other two corners. 
For example, sometimes a family member might use another’s information to get a loan to pay the rent. While that is easier to rationalize than a spending spree, it’s still a crime. 
REPORT
A big hurdle for victims is the emotional betrayal of someone they trust. Then comes the question of whether to report it. 
There’s a lot of guilt and shame about ‘’I should have known better’,” said Lacey of the Identity Theft Resource Center. “Now that person’s outcome is in (their) hand and (they) have a weighty decision to make.”
Lacey recommends victims report the crime in most cases. Law enforcement will need proof. 
The police report is “sort of your ticket to show to banks and credit reporting agencies” said Betz-Hamilton. It also helps convince banks and creditors that you aren’t complicit in the fraud, said Marchini. 
Consider seeking other help, such as through a victim’s support group like Identity Theft Resource Center or professional therapy. "
World trade without rules? US shuts down WTO appeals court,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/world-trade-rules-us-shuts-wto-appeals-court-67605603,"
Global commerce will lose its ultimate umpire Tuesday, leaving countries unable to reach a final resolution of disputes at the World Trade Organization and instead facing what critics call “the law of the jungle.’’
The United States, under a president who favors a go-it-alone approach to economics and diplomacy, appears to prefer it that way.
The terms of two of the last three judges on the WTO’s appellate body neared their end at midnight Tuesday. Their departure will deprive the de facto Supreme Court of world trade of its ability to issue rulings.
Among the disputes left in limbo are seven cases that have been brought against Trump’s decision last year to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to U.S. national security and to hit them with import taxes. 
The WTO’s lower court — its dispute settlement body — can hear cases. But its decisions will go nowhere if the loser appeals to a higher court that is no longer functioning.
Without having to worry about rebukes from the WTO, countries could use tariffs and other sanctions to limit imports. Such rising protectionism could create uncertainty and discourage trade. 
“We are in a crisis moment for our global trading system,’’ said U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla, who sits on the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade. “As of tomorrow, the court will cease to exist.’’ 
The loss of a global trade court of final appeals, Murphy said, is “really dangerous for American businesses.’’
The panel is supposed to have seven judges. But their ranks have dwindled because the United States — under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump — has blocked new appointments to protest the way the WTO does business.
Trump and his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, are especially vociferous critics of the WTO. They argue that the trade organization constrains America’s ability to counter unfair trading practices by China and other countries. 
Even other countries have complained about the WTO’s system for settling trade disputes. Critics say that cases take too long to resolve, that the panel often overreaches in its rulings and that the Geneva-based agency is ill-equipped to deal with the challenge posed by the Chinese economy’s unconventional blend of capitalism and state control.
Getting the WTO to reform is difficult because it requires consensus from its 164 member countries. Trump is willing to use America's economic and political clout to shake things up in a way that smaller countries couldn't.
“Where the United States is completely alone is the approach they’ve taken, (which) is to say: ‘We’re just going to blow this thing up,’ ” said Bernard Hoekman, an economist at the European University Institute.
The impending shutdown was met with dismay by several WTO member countries.
Zhang Xiangchen, China’s ambassador to the WTO, said in a statement that he was marking the occasion by wearing the black tie his wife had given him for funerals. Letting the “lights go out’’ at the appellate body, at least temporarily, Zhang said, is delivering what is “no doubt the most severe blow to the multilateral trading system since its establishment.’’
The EU's WTO ambassador, Joao Aguiar Machado, said in a statement, “The very idea of a rules based multilateral trading system is at stake.'' The EU, he said, “will not support, and will not condone, a system slipping into power-based economic relationships.’’
The EU and other countries have been working to set up an ersatz appellate body — including some former members of the existing appeals panel — to arbitrate future trade disputes. But that's just a stopgap. And it is uncertain how many countries might join in. 
The WTO was set up in 1995 to write and regulate the rules of global trade. Earlier, countries had complained that the United States was using its clout as the world’s No. 1 economy to unilaterally impose trade sanctions and to strong-arm other countries into limiting exports to America. (During the Reagan administration, Lighthizer was involved in arranging such “voluntary export restraints.’’)
For its part, the United States wanted more access to foreign markets.
The WTO’s dispute settlement process, including the Appellate Body, was meant to establish that written rules, not arbitrary power, governed global trade.
But the process has proved cumbersome. The appellate panel is notorious for missing deadlines, a problem that worsened as it lost judges. It is supposed to rule within 90 days but last year needed an average of 395 days to issue decisions.
Since 1995, 592 cases have been brought to the WTO (124 by the United States, the No. 1 complainant); the appellate body has issued 120 rulings, covering 162 of those cases. Most of the rest were dropped or resolved outside the WTO process.
Still, a former WTO appellate judge, Peter Van den Bossche, now a professor at Switzerland’s University of Bern, last week called the WTO’s dispute settlement process “a glorious experiment with the rule of law in international relations.’’
Its shutdown, he said, would leave countries and companies contending with “the law of the jungle ... the law of the strongest ... and that will hurt us all.’’

3 arrested for alleged $722 million cryptocurrency 'Ponzi scheme',https://abcnews.go.com/Business/arrested-alleged-722-million-cryptocurrency-ponzi-scheme-targeting/story?id=67655393,"
Three people were arrested -- and two more remain at large -- for involvement in an alleged ""high-tech Ponzi scheme"" that defrauded $722 million out of investors using the ""complex world of cryptocurrency,"" according to federal authorities.

The alleged scheme includes a trail of evidence indicating they were targeting ""dumb"" investors and ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" investigators added.
""The indictment describes the defendants’ use of the complex world of cryptocurrency to take advantage of unsuspecting investors,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a Department of Justice statement on Tuesday announcing the arrests.

""What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Carpentino added. ""Working with our law enforcement partners here and across the country, we will ensure that these scammers are held to account for their crimes.""
Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, and Jobadiah Sinclair Week, 38, of Colorado, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. Joseph Franks Abel, 49, of California, also arrested as part of the alleged scheme, was charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities.

Two other defendants remain at large, authorities said. Their identities are under seal and were not released.

The men allegedly lived ""lavishly"" while running the scheme, which began more than five years ago.

The three men arrested ""are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,"" Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement.

""The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims' money lavishly,"" Delacourt added.

John R. Tafur, the special agent in charge at the IRS Criminal Investigation's Newark Field Office described their alleged scheme as a ""classic con game with a virtual twist.""
From April 2014 until this month, the men allegedly ran BitClub Network, which rewarded investors for recruiting new investors and brought in money from them in exchange for shares in the apparent crypto mining pools.

Goettsche told the others to target ""dumb"" investors, who he referred to as ""sheep,"" authorities said. At one point, he said he was ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" according the DOJ.

In a particularly damning exchange in February 2015, Goettsche told a colleague to ""bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%."" His colleague said back: ""that is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi ... but sure,"" authorities said.

Abel and Weeks promoted BitClub Network to investors around the country, law enforcement said. In one promotional video, Abel told investors that BitClub Network was ""too big to fail.""

In September 2017, Goettsche directed a colleague at BitClub Network to ""[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now,"" so that he could ""retire RAF!!! (rich as f***).""

The men were arrested across the country: Goettsche in Colorado, Weeks in Florida and Abel in California. Their initial court appearances are scheduled in the districts of their arrests, according to authorities.

It is not immediately clear if the three arrested have obtained attorneys. Attempts by ABC News to reach them on Wednesday were unsuccessful.

The DOJ is encouraging victims of the BitClub Network scheme to come forward at a designated website.

Cleveland-Cliffs buying AK Steel in $1.1B stock deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/cleveland-cliffs-buying-ak-steel-11b-stock-deal-67458556,"
Cleveland-Cliffs will buy AK Steel in a stock deal valued at about $1.1 billion.
The companies say the tie-up will create a vertically integrated company that pairs Cleveland-Cliff’s iron ore pellet production with AK Steel’s rolled and stainless steel operations.
Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America.
After a brief spike in prices, U.S. steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25% steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe, with prices for natural gas tumbling 45% over the past 12 months.
U.S. Steel in its last quarter reported its first loss since early 2017, and the division that makes pipes for energy companies lost $25 million. It has laid off workers and shut down some of its blast furnaces.
The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30% this year, and the stock of steel producers have fallen in tandem.
The steel industry added just 1,800 jobs since February 2018, the month before the tariffs took effect, and it employs 10,000 fewer people than they did five years ago.
AK Steel Holding Corp. stockholders will receive 0.40 shares of Cliffs stock for each AK Steel share they own. Cliffs shareholders will own approximately 68% of the combined company and AK Steel shareholders will own about 32%.
AK Steel will become a subsidiary of Cliffs and keep its branding and corporate identity. Cliffs will remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Its headquarters will stay in Cleveland, while maintaining a significant presence at AK Steel’s current offices in West Chester, Ohio along with its research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year.
Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs dropped 12%, while AK Steel’s stock gained 4.5%."
Lebanese central bank slashes interest rates amid crisis,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/lebanese-central-bank-slashes-interest-rates-amid-crisis-67494152,"
Lebanon’s central bank on Wednesday dramatically lowered interest rates on dollar and Lebanese pound deposits and loans — the latest measure to shore up the country’s banking system amid a burgeoning economic crisis.
Banque de Liban also announced that for the next six months it would pay 50% of the interest it owes banks on dollar deposits and deposit certificates in Lebanese pounds— a move that would also ease the demand on the dollar.
The decisions come as Lebanon, the world’s third most indebted country in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio, faces an unprecedented economic and political crisis amid nearly 50 days of nationwide protests.
More than a month after the government resigned, President Michel Aoun announced Wednesday that he will hold formal consultations to name a new prime minister next week. He set Monday for the one-day meetings with parliamentary groups. But protesters have already began rallying against the potential candidate for the job, saying he is too close to the political elite they have been calling on to step down.
In a stark reflection of the deepening economic crisis, a man in his 40s shot himself to death Wednesday with a bird rifle when he became despondent over salary cuts in recent weeks, according to his family.
The father of 41-year-old Danny Abi Haidar said his son, who worked in a lighting company, spent the day Tuesday warding off creditors, trying to explain that he only received half his salary because of the economic crisis. Many private companies have resorted to reducing staff or slashing their pay to deal with rising inflation and liquidity crunch.
Adding to the burden, the son had been supporting his father, his mother and younger brother. The father had lost his job eight months ago and moved in with his older son.
On Tuesday, the local supermarket began demanding hundreds of dollars that Abi Haidar, a father of three, owed them.
Creditors “called him and he said I only got paid half my salary,” the father, Mohammed Abi Haidar, told The Associated Press. “He said I only have 200,000 liras (barely $100) to spend on my family.”
The father, distraught, said he holds senior officials and the protests responsible for his son’s death.
“I hold those senior officials responsible; the revolution and everyone, I hold them responsible,” Abi Haidar said.
Protesters, already mobilized against the name floated as a potential successor for resigned Prime Minister Saad Hariri, gathered in central Beirut on Wednesday to mourn Abi Haidar’s death.
“How many more suicides do you want?” read one placard raised by a protester. Marwa Saad, a protester who was among hundreds at a rally that blocked a major Beirut intersection, said government officials are wasting time and fail to sense the depth of the public misery.
“They are blind and deaf while we burn and kill ourselves. They still don’t feel a thing,” she said, raising a Lebanese flag. The protesters light candles along the road they blocked. Security forces deployed but didn’t forcefully open the road.
The protesters say Samir Khatib, named as a possible prime minister and a prominent contractor, is close to the political elite they have been protesting since Oct. 17.
Hundreds of protesters blocked in towns in the Bekaa valley in the east on Wednesday in rallies against Khatib. Lebanon’s armed forces said it arrested 16 protesters following scuffles to break up road blocks.
To alleviate the pressure on the banks amid a liquidity crunch and rising risk of defaulting, Lebanon’s central bank said it has put a ceiling on interest rates, slashing them on dollar deposits and loans to 5% from as high as 14%.
The central bank’s decision applies to new deposits and ones renewed after Wednesday. Interest rates on Lebanese pound-denominated deposits would be set at 8.5%.
Depositors have rushed to withdraw their money after banks reopened following a two-week shut-down at the start of the protests.
Lebanese officials estimate that as much as $4 billion have been withdrawn from banks over the past weeks as the local currency loses nearly 40% of its value. The money remains in the country but reflects the deepening confidence crisis banks are facing.
Local banks also imposed capital control measures unseen before in the country known for its free-market economy, such as limiting withdrawals and transfers of money abroad.
The central bank’s decisions buy time until a new government is formed. International donors had pledged $11 billion to Lebanon’s troubled economy in 2018, long before the protests began. But the donors had called for major economic changes to release the loans and grants.
Hariri resigned Oct. 29 amid nationwide protests, saying he reached a “dead end” with his political rivals over an emergency government. The protesters have been calling for a technocrat government, accusing the current political elite of widespread corruption and mismanagement of the country’s economy. Hariri has expressed support for Khatib as a potential successor."
China's trade with US sinks in November amid tariff war,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chinas-trade-us-sinks-november-amid-tariff-war-67575201,"
China's trade with the United States sank again in November as negotiators worked on the first stage of a possible deal to end a tariff war. 
Exports to the United States fell 23% from a year earlier to $35.6 billion, customs data showed Sunday. Imports of American goods were off 2.8% at $11 billion, giving China a surplus with the United States of $24.6 billion.
Exports to some other countries including France rose, helping to offset the loss. 
China’s global exports were off 1.1% from a year earlier at $221.7 billion despite weakening worldwide demand. Imports were up 0.3% at $183 billion, giving China a global surplus of $38.7 billion.
Hopes for a settlement to the fight over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus rose after President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “Phase 1” agreement following talks in October. But there has been no sign of agreement on details nearly two months later.
The dispute has disrupted global trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment and threatens to depress economic growth.
Trump put off a tariff increase in October but penalties already imposed by both sides on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place. Another U.S. increase is due on Sunday on $160 billion of Chinese goods. That would extend penalties to almost everything Americans buy from China.
Chinese spokespeople have expressed hope for a settlement “as soon as possible,” but Trump spooked financial markets last week by saying he might be willing to wait until after the U.S. presidential election late next year.
Financial markets have repeatedly risen on optimism about the talks only to fall back when no progress is announced.
The “Phase 1” agreement doesn’t cover contentious issues including U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Economists warn tensions could rise again next year and the bulk of tariff hikes are likely to stay in place for some time.
For the first 11 months of 2019, China’s total global exports were off 0.3% at $2.3 trillion despite the tariff war. Imports were down 4.5% at $1.8 trillion, adding to signs Chinese domestic demand is cooling.
China's exporters have been hurt by the U.S. tariff hikes but its overall economy has been unexpectedly resilient. Growth in the world's second-largest economy slipped to 6% over a year earlier in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2% but still among the world's strongest.
Weaker Chinese demand has global repercussions, depressing demand for industrial raw materials and components from other Asian economies and oil, iron ore and other commodities from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.
The Ministry of Finance announced Friday that China was waiving punitive import duties on U.S. soybeans and pork, keeping a promise announced in September.
A sticking point is Beijing’s insistence that Washington roll back its most recent penalties on Chinese goods as part of the “Phase 1” deal. Beijing said last month the U.S. side agreed, but Trump dismissed that.
A Chinese spokesman repeated Thursday that Beijing expects such a move in a “Phase 1” agreement."
Phone-in-cheek: Spike seen in cellphone-linked face injuries,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/phone-cheek-spike-cellphone-linked-face-injuries-67529152,"
Add facial cuts, bruises and fractures to the risks from cellphones and carelessly using them. 
That's according to a         study published Thursday that found a spike in U.S. emergency room treatment for these mostly minor injuries.
The research was led by a facial plastic surgeon whose patients include a woman who broke her nose when she dropped her phone on her face. Dr. Boris Paskhover of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School said his experience treating patients with cellphone injuries prompted him to look into the problem. 
Paskhover and others analyzed 20 years of emergency room data and found an increase in cellphone injuries starting after 2006, around the time when the first smartphones were introduced.
Some injuries were caused by phones themselves, including people getting hit by a thrown phone. But Paskhover said many were caused by distracted use including texting while walking, tripping and landing face-down on the sidewalk. 
Most patients in the study weren’t hospitalized, but the researchers said the problem should be taken seriously. 
The study involved cases in a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission database that collects emergency room visit information from about 100 hospitals. The researchers tallied 2,500 patients with cellphone-related head and neck injuries from 1998 through 2017. 
The study was published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology.
Nationwide, they estimated there were about 76,000 people injured during that time. Annual cases totaled fewer than 2,000 until 2006, but increased steeply after that. About 40% of those injured were ages 13 to 29, and many were hurt while walking, texting or driving.
Cellphone use also has been linked with repetitive strain injuries in the hands and neck, and injuries to other parts of the body caused by distracted use. 
“I love my smartphone,” Paskhover said, but he added that it’s easy to get too absorbed and avoiding injury requires common sense.
“People wouldn’t walk around reading a magazine,” he said. “Be careful.”

UAW abolishes regional office plagued by embezzlement,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uaw-abolishes-regional-office-plagued-embezzlement-67548143,"
A United Auto Workers regional office racked by embezzlement allegations is being abolished and combined into two neighboring regions.
UAW Region 5 in St. Louis will be merged into regional offices in Lebanon, Tennessee, and Lincolnshire, Illinois, the union said in a statement Friday.
President Rory Gamble said in the statement the two regions that will take over Region 5 have been managed prudently.
The St. Louis region covers 17 states from Missouri to Hawaii.
The union will keep an office in St. Louis because of the high number of members it has in the area, spokesman Brian Rothenberg said. The UAW is still working on how to divide up Region 5 between the other two offices, he said.
Top union officials have been accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars through Region 5 conferences that were held in Palm Springs, California. Vance Pearson, the former head of Region 5, has been charged in the case. Former UAW President Gary Jones was director of the region before Pearson. Federal agents raided Jones' Detroit-area home last summer, but he has not been charged in the case. Both men have resigned from the union.
More than $600,000 in UAW money paid to Renaissance Palm Springs Hotel was used to pay debts by union officials at area businesses, including restaurants, a golf resort, cigar shop and rental properties, between 2014 and 2017, the government alleged in court records.
Investigators uncovered a receipt for a New Year's Eve 2016 meal totaling more than $6,000, including four bottles of champagne for $1,760. They said there was evidence of a ""culture of alcohol"" in the senior ranks.
Jones' lawyer has said that all expenses were submitted in detail and were not questioned by UAW accounting department or the executive board.
The embezzlement allegations are part of a widening federal probe into corruption at the union. Allegations also include bribery with money paid from the Fiat Chrysler-UAW joint training center.
Ten people with ties to the UAW have been charged in the investigation. Eight have pleaded guilty, including two former vice presidents and the widow of another. Separately, three people who worked at Fiat Chrysler have been convicted."
Airline group: We're cutting carbon more than people know,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/airline-group-cutting-carbon-people-67658436,"GENEVA -- 
The head of the world’s main association of airlines says it needs to better explain commitments it made years ago to reduce carbon emissions, and not make new pledges collectively - despite rising environmental concerns.
Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said perhaps “arrogance or blindness” led his group to focus on explaining its efforts to industry insiders, not the general public.
“What we have seen is that nobody is aware of our program,” he said in an interview at IATA headquarters in Geneva. “It's our fault, probably.”
The association made three big commitments on climate action since 2008. It pledged to improve fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5% per year between 2009 and 2020 - and IATA actually achieved 2.3%, de Juniac said. It’s pledging carbon-neutral growth starting next year. And it’s committed to cut emissions to half of the level in 2005 by 2050.
With concerns about the global warming caused by excessive carbon emissions from use of fossil fuels, de Juniac stopped short of recommending that IATA’s members - some 290 airlines - make new efforts together. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says aviation is responsible for 2% of global man-made carbon emissions.
EasyJet, which is not an IATA member, has announced carbon offsets for all its domestic and international flights. IATA members British Airways and Qantas have made similar commitments, de Juniac said.
He said airlines individually should decide whether to follow suit.
“What we don't want by any means is to make any commitments that we know in advance we are not able or that we are not comfortable (about), or not realistically ... able to stick to,” he said. “We are not liars ... We are not illusionists.”
The comments came at a presentation at which IATA said it projected the global airline industry will reap net profit of $29.3 billion in 2020. That is up from $25.9 billion expected this year, which has been marred by a US-China trade war and other international tensions that have dented economic growth. 
IATA says the industry appears on track toward an 11th straight year of profits by the end of next year."
Asian stocks follow Wall Street lower on trade worries,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-stocks-follow-wall-street-lower-trade-worries-67483219,"
Asian stock markets followed Wall Street lower after President Donald Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year.
Benchmarks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney fell more than 1% while Shanghai and South Korea also retreated.
Trump said he has ""no deadline"" for a trade deal and doesn’t mind waiting until after next year’s presidential election to make one. Investors had hoped for at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.
Tensions flared last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.
“Until both sides dial down their hawkish rhetoric, markets will continue to pull back earlier optimism,” said DBS Group analysts in a report. “Trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks.”
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.03% to 23,141.68 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gave up 1.2% to 26,077.77.
The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.3% to 2,874.88 and Seoul’s Kospi declined 0.8% to 2,060.81. Australia’s S&P-ASX 200 fell 1.4% to 6,621.40 and benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Southeast Asia also retreated.
India’s Sensex bucked the trend, opening up 0.1% to 40,724.00.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.7% to 3,093.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% to 27,502.81. The Nasdaq dropped 0.6% to 8,520.64.
Negotiators have yet to agree on details of an interim deal Trump has called ""Phase 1.""
Investors also are weighing the potential for additional trade disputes.
On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.
Also Wednesday, Australia disappointed investors by reporting third-quarter economic growth declined to 0.4% over the previous quarter from 0.6% in the three months ending in June. The Australian central bank had described the economy as experiencing a ""gentle upturn.”

Horizon Air warns about lax safety culture among its pilots,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/horizon-air-warns-lax-safety-culture-pilots-67520283,"
Horizon Air’s head of flight operations recently warned of a a lax safety culture among the airline’s pilots and called for urgent action to prevent a serious air accident.
The Seattle Times         reported that John Hornibrook, the Seattle-based airline’s president of flight operations, wrote in an internal Nov. 27 email message: “If we sit back and do nothing, we will have an accident. Nothing good can come of the trajectory we are currently on.”
The email was sent to top airline managers and pilot leaders.
The incidents Hornibrook listed ranged from pilots going over airspeed limits to aircraft approaching stalls, and also included weather-induced threats that perhaps could have been avoided.
In an interview with the newspaper, Hornibrook and Horizon president Joe Sprague said the distribution of the email should be seen as an example of Horizon’s high safety standards.
“The memo was meant to respond to the spike we saw in irregular events,” Hornibrook said. “I’m not sitting back and waiting for something bigger.”
Horizon Air's pilots fly Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E175 jets on routes that link smaller cities into a feeder network for Alaska Airlines.
The only serious accident in the airline’s passenger service history happened in 1988, when a Q400 crash-landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after an engine fire. Four passengers suffered serious injuries.
In 2017, a major pilot shortage at Horizon caused hundreds of flight cancellations. In response, Horizon raised pilot pay, added signing bonuses and boosted recruitment. "

PG&E says it has reached $13.5 billion wildfire settlement,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pge-reached-135-billion-wildfire-settlement-67560497,"
Pacific Gas and Electric says it has reached a $13.5 billion settlement that will resolve all major claims related to devastating wildfires blamed on its outdated equipment and negligence.
The settlement, which the utility says was reached Friday, still requires court approval. PG&E says it is a key step in leading it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
It adds that the settlement will resolve all claims arising from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp Fire, as well as all claims from the 2015 Butte Fire and 2016 Ghost Ship Fire in Oakland.
“From the beginning of the Chapter 11 process, getting wildfire victims fairly compensated, especially the individuals, has been our primary goal,"" Bill Johnson, PG&E Corporation's CEO and president, said in a statement. “We want to help our customers, our neighbors and our friends in those impacted areas recover and rebuild after these tragic wildfires.”
The settlement is still subject to a number of conditions involving PG&E’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plans, which must be completed by June 30, 2020.
Friday's settlement figure responds to pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom to give wildfire victims more than it originally offered, but it still relies on the bankruptcy judge's approval as part of the proceedings. A February hearing at which an official estimation of losses will be made still looms for the utility and could upend any settlement deals.
“We appreciate all the hard work by many stakeholders that went into reaching this agreement,” Johnson said. “With this important milestone now accomplished, we are focused on emerging from Chapter 11 as the utility of the future that our customers and communities expect and deserve.”
PG&E said the proposed settlement is the third it has reached as it works through its Chapter 11 case. The utility previously reached a $1 billion settlement with cities, counties and other public utilities and an $11 billion agreement with insurance companies and other entities that have paid claims relating to the 2017 and 2018 fires."
Lebanon’s outgoing PM backs businessman to replace him,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/lebanons-outgoing-pm-backs-businessman-replace-67477215,"
Lebanon’s outgoing Prime Minister Saad Hariri said Tuesday he supports the nomination of a prominent contractor to become the next premier, a move that will likely pave the way for the formation of a new Cabinet amid a severe economic and financial crisis.
The news of the possible nomination of Samir Khatib, the head of a major contracting and construction company, sparked spontaneous late-night protests. Hundreds gathered at a strategic intersection in Beirut, known as the Ring Road, blocking the road and chanting against Khatib. Security forces tried to prevent the protesters from blocking the road that links east to west Beirut, and after a warning, used tear gas to disperse them.
""We will not accept this as people, and we will not accept this as revolutionaries, because we know that we are heading toward the abyss with this government,” Elie Kayrouz, an anti-government protester at the Ring Road, said, describing Khatib and other names leaked to the media who may form the new Cabinet as connected to the outgoing one.
After briefly dispersing, protesters attempted to gather again to block the road.
Hariri resigned on Oct. 29 amid nationwide protests and a stalemate with political rivals over forming a new government. Meanwhile, Lebanon, one of the world's most indebted countries in terms of debt-to GDP ratio, is reeling under the pressure of an unprecedented economic crunch that has only worsened amid the political crisis.
The currency has lost nearly 40 percent of its value in the face of the dollar. Lebanon is also grappling with high unemployment and an expected sharp contraction of the economy in 2020. Local banks have imposed capital control measures unseen before in the country known for its free-market economy.
Hariri withdrew his candidacy last week, saying he hoped it would clear the way for a solution to the political impasse amid nearly eight weeks of protests.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday night, Hariri said he backs Khatib to become the next prime minister. ""There are still some details and God willing something good” will happen, he said. ""Everyone is trying to get through this difficult period.”
Khatib heads one of Lebanon’s largest engineering and contracting companies and did not hold any political roles in the past. The protesters perceive him as too close to the ruling elite, against which they have been protesting, though it is not clear if his official nomination would spark wider protests.
Over the past weeks, politicians failed to agree on the shape and form of a new government. Hariri had insisted on heading a government of technocrats, while his opponents, including the militant group Hezbollah, want a Cabinet made up of both experts and politicians.
Asked if he is going to take part in the new Cabinet, Hariri said: “I will not nominate political personalities but experts.”
The protesters have been demonstrating against widespread corruption and mismanagement in the country. They have resorted to road closures and other tactics to pressure politicians into responding to their demands of forming a new government and holding new elections.
They have insisted that a new Cabinet be made up of independent figures outside the elite who have been running the country since the 1975-90 civil war ended.
President Michel Aoun now is expected to call for binding consultations with heads of parliamentary blocs to name the new prime minister. But since Hariri, the most powerful Sunni leader in the country, said he will back Khatib, the contractor is widely expected to get the post.
According to Lebanon's sectarian-based political system, the prime minister comes from the Sunni Muslim community, while the president is chosen from the Maronite Christian community. The parliament speaker is chosen from the ranks of Shiite Muslims. Cabinet and parliament seats are equally split between Christians and Muslims.
Earlier in the day, outgoing Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil hinted that he will not be part of the new government telling reporters that “the success of the Cabinet is more important than our presence in it.
The protests late Tuesday come a day after protesters hurled stones at soldiers while opening a highway south of Beirut, injuring several troops. The Lebanese army said in a statement on Tuesday that one of the protesters in the town of Naameh fired bullets from a pistol the night before adding that the shooting made the troops fire in the air to disperse the protesters.

‘Baby Shark’ creators plan Navajo version of popular video,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/baby-shark-creators-plan-navajo-version-popular-video-67465539,"
Creators of the popular video “Baby Shark,” whose “doo doo doo” song was played at the World Series in October and has been a viral hit with toddlers around the world, are developing a version in Navajo.
Pinkfong, a brand of the South Korea company SmartStudy, announced last week it is working with the Navajo Nation Museum in Window Rock, Arizona, to create a new version of the widely popular tune about a family of sharks.
The project was launched after museum director Manuelito Wheeler reached out to SmartStudy in September about translating “Baby Shark” into Navajo. The museum previously had lobbied for Navajo versions of the movies “Star Wars” and “Finding Nemo” that were eventually made.
“I was surprised by their enthusiasm and excitement about getting this started,” Wheeler said Tuesday. “We have been looking for something aimed at preschoolers.”
SmartStudy has translated the “Baby Shark” tune of the viral video in 19 languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, Arabic, and Bahasa-Malay.
The company hopes its latest project will spark interest in the Navajo language among the tribe’s young generation, SmartStudy marketing manager Kevin Yoon said in an email.
“We’re happy to play a role in raising awareness of and preserving a language that’s in danger of vanishing through what we do best — creating fun, stimulating content to provide entertaining learning experiences to children worldwide,” Yoon said.
The Navajo Nation is the largest Native American reservation in the U.S. The Navajo word for shark is lóó hashkéhé, which translates to “angry fish.”
The company is seeking voice actors to portray the roles of Baby Shark, Mommy Shark, Daddy Shark, Grandma Shark, and Grandpa Shark.
The original “         Baby Shark Dance ” video has garnered more than 4 billion views on YouTube.
“Baby Shark” has been around for a few years, but took the world by storm last year when the song and video went viral with the nursery-school set, with little kids imitating the handclapping dance that went along with the video.
Books, plush toys, and other merchandise inspired by the song became hot-ticket items for the holidays and the “Baby Shark” tour was soon hatched.
A second North American leg of the “Baby Shark” concert tour is launching in March.
During the World Series, Washington Nationals fans adopted “Baby Shark” as the team’s rally song.
Nickelodeon has a “Baby Shark” cartoon series in the works.

Jury: Elon Musk did not defame British caver in tweet,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/jury-elon-musk-defame-british-caver-tweet-67556425,"
Elon Musk defeated defamation allegations Friday from a British cave explorer who claimed he was branded a pedophile when the Tesla CEO called him “pedo guy” in an angry tweet.
Vernon Unsworth, who participated in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for weeks in a Thailand cave last year, had sought $190 million in damages from a man his lawyer called the “billionaire bully."" 
It took less than an hour for an eight-person jury in Los Angeles federal court to reject Unsworth's claim. 
Musk said the verdict restored his faith in humanity as he left the court with a security detail.
Musk — who deleted the tweet and later apologized for it — had asserted the expression was nothing more than a flippant insult that meant “creepy old man,” not pedophile.
Unsworth had provoked the attack by belittling Musk’s contribution to the rescue -- a miniature sub his engineers built that was never used -- as ineffective and nothing more than a “PR stunt.” He further earned the ire of the tech whiz by suggesting Musk stick the sub “where it hurts.”
On Friday, it was Unsworth who felt the pain.
“I accept the jury verdict, take it on the chin, and move on,” Unsworth said outside court. 
Jury foreman Joshua Jones said the panel decided Unsworth’s lawyers had failed to prove their case. He said they spent too much time trying to appeal to jurors' emotions and not concentrating on the evidence. 
“The failure probably happened because they didn’t focus on the tweets,” Jones said after the verdict was announced. “I think they tried to get our emotions involved in it.""
Attorney Lin Wood suggested the jury should award $190 million, including $150 million as a “hard slap on the wrist” to punish Tesla CEO for what he said was akin to dropping an atomic weapon on his client that would create problems for years like a radioactive fallout. 
Wood said it was important to challenge Musk's tweet in court even if they didn't win. Unsworth had said the statement would appear true if he didn't sue. 
""Anybody that knows this man, knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Elon’s accusations were false,"" Wood said outside court. “This was not the justice that he deserved under the evidence.”
Wood said the verdict sends a message that people can get away with making accusations.
“Everyone who hears about this verdict should be very, very concerned about their own reputations,"" he said.
Musk's lawyer told the jury the tweet did not rise to the level of defamation. Attorney Alex Spiro said Unsworth also failed to show actual damages.
Spiro left the courthouse only saying that the jury did the right thing. 
Spiro mocked Unsworth's claims that he had been shamed and humiliated and that the tweet effectively sentenced him to a life sentence without parole, noting that there are many people actually serving such a term. 
Spiro noted that Unsworth had been honored by the queen of England and the king of Thailand, had his photo taken next to British Prime Minister Theresa May and been asked to speak at schools and contribute to a children's book, which showed that no one took Musk's insult seriously.
“People accused of pedophilia don't get celebrated by world leaders,” Spiro said. “Kings and queens and prime ministers don't stand next to pedophiles.”"
Asian shares rise after buying mood on Wall Street ends week,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-rise-buying-mood-wall-street-ends-67587567,"
Asian shares were mostly higher Monday, cheered by a wave of buying late last week on Wall Street that was spurred by strong U.S. jobs numbers and optimism over China-U.S. trade. 
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.4% in early trading to 23,439.13, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 6,735.70. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,087.92. Hong Kong's Hang Seng picked up 0.1% to 26,511.78. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.1% to 2,910.31.
“Markets were mostly higher on the solid U.S. jobs data print,"" Vishnu Varathan of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report, adding that questions remained on whether would prove enough amid other global risks. 
The Japanese Cabinet Office reported Monday that the economy expanded at a 1.8% annual pace in July-September, spurred by strong consumer purchases ahead of an Oct. 1 sales tax hike. That was much stronger than the 0.2% growth earlier reported and marked a fourth straight quarter of expansion for the world's No. 3 economy. 
The surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report had put investors in a buying mood on Wall Street, extending the market’s winning streak to a third day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 300 points, while the S&P 500 erased losses from earlier in the week, nudging the benchmark index to a second consecutive weekly gain.
The Labor Department said employers added 266,000 positions, well above estimates of 184,000. The report also showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low. Separately, an index that measures how consumers feel about the economy showed an increase from last month.
The S&P 500 rose 0.9% to 3,145.91. The index posted a 0.2% gain for the week, a solid pivot from losses of more than 1% as of late Thursday. It’s now within 0.3% of its all-time high set on Nov. 27 and up 25.5% so far this year.
The latest gains also helped stem some of the losses for the Dow and Nasdaq.
The Dow climbed 337.27 points, or 1.2%, to 28,015.06. The Nasdaq gained 85.83 points, or 1%, to 8,656.53. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 19 points, or 1.2%, to 1,633.84.
Friday’s batch of encouraging economic data capped what started as a rough week for the market.
Increased trade tensions and disappointing economic reports -- including data showing manufacturing continues to shrink and growth in the service sector is slowing -- dragged the market to steep losses on Monday and Tuesday. 
The latest employment report and consumer sentiment data are a welcome development as steady job growth has been one of the bright spots in the economy, along with solid consumer spending.
Investors also got some encouraging news on the U.S.-China trade front, with Beijing saying Friday that it is waiving punitive tariffs on U.S. soybeans and pork as negotiations for a trade deal continue.

Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepping down as CEO and president,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/google-founders-larry-page-sergey-brin-stepping-company/story?id=67472607,"
Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin -- who built the tech giant 20 years ago with servers in a garage -- announced on Tuesday that they are stepping down as CEO and president, respectively, from the company.

Sundar Pichai will be the new CEO of Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., effective immediately, according to a statement from the company.
Page and Brin co-founded the company in 1998 and led it to becoming the international tech industry leader it is today. The two will remain active at Alphabet Inc. as co-founders, shareholders and board members, the company said.
In a joint open letter announcing their decision to leave, Page and Brin equated Google to their child, who would now be 21.

""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" the letter stated. ""While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!""
The letter added that they believe ""Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" and Pichai will take on the role of CEO for both Alphabet and Google, saying they ""plan to continue talking with Sundar regularly, especially on topics we’re passionate about!""
The founders added that they could have never imagined what Google would become when they started it in a dorm room and then a garage.

""We are deeply humbled to have seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment for billions - a bet we made as two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets,"" the letter said.

It continued: ""We could not have imagined, back in 1998 when we moved our servers from a dorm room to a garage, the journey that would follow.""
Pichai said in statement that he is ""looking forward to continuing to work with Larry and Sergey.""

""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration,"" Pichai added. ""It’s a strong foundation on which we will continue to build.”

Ukraine faces new challenges in peace talks with Russia,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ukraine-faces-challenges-peace-talks-russia-67576440,"
When new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sits down Monday for peace talks in Paris with Russian President Vladimir Putin in their first face-to-face meeting, the stakes couldn't be higher.
More than five years of fighting in eastern Ukraine between government troops and Moscow-backed separatists has killed more than 14,000 people, and a cease-fire has remained elusive. While Zelenskiy has made ending the conflict a priority, the political novice arrives at the table with the veteran Kremlin leader in what appears to be a less-advantageous position:
— Zelenskiy still hasn't had the White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump that he sought to bolster his stature on the world stage.
— French President Emmanuel Macron, the host of the meeting, has made clear recently that he wants to re-engage with Russia and get back to doing business again after five years of sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.
— Macron and the other mediator in the talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be meeting Zelenskiy for the first time since it emerged that he criticized them in the July 25 phone call that has become the focus of an impeachment investigation against Trump.
So there are concerns among those who support Ukraine's sovereignty that Zelenskiy might end up giving too many concessions to Putin. That could lead to a backlash from Ukrainians who strongly oppose any rapprochement with Russia.
The talks are being organized in the so-called Normandy Format, which was launched soon after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine. The consultations had stalled since 2016 but have been revived following Zelenskiy's election. 
“There is a whole cocktail of economics and geopolitics that make the situation for Ukraine very difficult and is posing lot of challenges,"" said Bruno Lete, a security expert at the German Marshal Fund of the U.S., a leading think tank. 
“But it’s critical that Europeans and the U.S. support Ukraine,” Lete argued. ""Without peace and stability in Ukraine, there will never be peace and stability in Europe.”
The biggest challenge for Kyiv probably comes from France itself, with Macron speaking recently of the “brain death” of NATO because of a lack of coordination and leadership from Washington and also saying he wants to re-engage with Russia. 
“It’s like telling Russia, ‘I will work with you and we’ll see about Ukraine,’” Lete said. “He should have waited until after the Normandy meeting. It doesn’t help the cause of European security.”
The Normandy Format talks had have also been revived following several confidence-building steps between Moscow and Kyiv, including prisoner swaps and troop withdrawals by both sides.
On Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the talks to bring peace ""to that territory and its population.”
Taras Kuzio, a security expert and professor at National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, said Zelenskiy has already weakened his own position by agreeing to the talks even though Russia insists Crimea is non-negotiable. 
Kuzio described the 41-year-old Zelenskiy, until recently a comedic actor, as “extremely naïve about international relations” and said he will find himself in a difficult place — facing a tough opponent in Putin and a population that would reject any capitulation to Moscow.
He said Zelenskiy doesn’t grasp that the Russian leader will never compromise over the conflict in eastern Ukraine because “for Putin, compromise is a defeat.” 
And Macron’s pursuit of a reset with Moscow doesn't help Ukraine either. 
“The danger is that Zelenskiy will be ambushed by Macron working in effect for Putin because his new agenda is to repair relations with Russia, to get back to a normal relationship, get back to doing business,” Kuzio said. 
Despite the challenges, Ukraine still has the support from the European Union, its biggest foreign donor, while Merkel has strongly supported sanctions on Russia. 
But Germany's longer-term economic interests are a continual challenge for Ukraine.
Berlin is seen as having harmed Ukraine's interests by moving forward with the completion of a Russian-German gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2 that will bring Russian natural gas to Western Europe. Its route bypasses Ukraine, cutting off its leverage as a transit country and an income source. 
Germany's relationship with Moscow has been complicated by last week's expulsion of two Russian diplomats over the brazen killing of a Georgian national in Berlin in August, with prosecutors suggesting the slaying was either ordered by Russia or authorities in the republic of Chechnya.
Zelenskiy also isn't helped by the revelations in the July 25 phone call with Trump. A rough transcript of the call revealed him accusing Merkel and Macron of giving too little help to Ukraine. At one point, Zelenskiy tells Trump: “When I was speaking to Angela Merkel, she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.” 
At the time of the call, the White House was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, adding to Ukraine's fears that the U.S. was turning its back on the vulnerable nation.
Ukrainian suspicions that the West cares more about doing business with Russia than Ukraine's sovereignty go back to when the former Soviet republic declared its independence in 1991.
A diplomatic cable written in 2009 by then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor described frustration by Kyiv's political elite. The Ukrainians believed Berlin was an ""obstacle in their drive towards EU and NATO membership,” Taylor wrote in the cable, which has been published by Wikileaks.
Taylor, now the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who testified in the impeachment hearings in Congress, cited a colorful formulation by Ukraine’s former National Security and Defense Council Chairman Volodymyr Horbulin which underscored that. 
Taylor wrote that Horbulin joked that there are two Russian embassies in Kyiv, but “one speaks German.""
Vadim Karasev, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kyiv-based think tank, said the Europeans ""have grown tired of Kyiv’s endless problems and are increasingly looking at Moscow, which has all the instruments to leverage the situation.” 
“They increasingly remind Kyiv about delayed reforms and corruption instead of talking about solidarity and a common European home,” Karasev said.
European powers, he said, ""can’t endlessly deal with Kyiv’s problems when they have their own issues to solve.”

Nissan gives workers 2 unpaid days off as US sales slump,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nissan-workers-unpaid-days-off-us-sales-slump-67528511,"
Nissan Motor Co. is making its U.S. factory and office employees take two days off without pay amid slumping sales.
The company's U.S. sales this year are down 7.8% through November. 
Nissan says nearly all of its 21,000 U.S. workers must take Jan. 2 and 3 off without compensation. A company statement says the furloughs will “optimize business performance and competitiveness."" 
All of Nissan's U.S. factories and offices will be affected by the furloughs including the North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee, near Nashville. Nissan and Infiniti dealerships will remain open. 
Most Nissan and Infiniti luxury brand models in the U.S. are in a sales slump, including the company's top seller, the Nissan Rogue compact SUV, with sales down 12.6% so far this year.
Nissan's profit from July through September was half of what it earned a year ago. The company's sales and brand power have crumbled following the November 2018 arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Allegations against him include underreporting of his compensation and breaching trust by making dubious payments.
Last summer the Japanese automaker said it would cut 12,500 jobs, or about 9% of its global workforce, to pare costs and turn around its business. "
OPEC talks end without announcement of expected cuts,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/opec-debates-deeper-production-cuts-push-oil-price-67512655,"
The countries that make up the OPEC oil-producing cartel ended talks late Thursday without an announcement on possible deep cuts to production that would support the price of fuel around the world.
An OPEC spokesman told waiting journalists at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT) that an expected news conference would not take place and that a written statement might come later. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and other officials then left the meeting without announcing any deal.
OPEC’s members have been expected to prolong production cuts that they agreed on for the past three years, while Russia’s energy minister said that even deeper cuts were under discussion. The price of crude has been held down in recent years by a resurgence in supplies from countries outside OPEC, particularly the United States.
As it stands, OPEC nations have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, whose country is not part of OPEC but joins part of the meeting to coordinate production, said Thursday that the group was discussing a further cut of 500,000 barrels a day “in order to safely go through the seasonal demand trough in the first quarter 2020.”
OPEC officials were to broaden discussions to include non-OPEC members on Friday.
Saudi Arabia is bearing the burden of the largest share of OPEC’s production cuts. But some member countries such as Iraq have been breaching the agreement and producing more than their allotted amount.
Analysts note that if countries are already not complying with the current agreement, voting for more cuts could be pointless.
“I think the Saudi position is they’re willing to cut more if needed, but they want better compliance,” said Bhushan Bahree, executive director of global oil at research group IHS Markit.
Brent crude oil hovered near $63 per barrel Thursday. Prices have fluctuated throughout the year, reaching nearly $75 in April after U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela limited world supply, but lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China dampened economic expectations pushed prices back down.
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was trading above $58.
Russia has indicated it wants its oil production re-calculated to exclude gas condensate, a liquid byproduct of natural gas production. Condensate is counted against production totals for non-OPEC members but not for members.
Even if members of the cartel cut production, there is more oil coming to market from non-OPEC nations, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana, which will more than make up for any drop in production, according to IHS Markit.

"OPEC countries, Russia to cut oil output, pushing up prices",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/opec-nations-russia-cut-oil-output-lift-prices-67539627,"
The OPEC oil-producing countries and ally Russia said Friday they have agreed to cut crude production, prompting a surge in global crude prices that they hope to sustain into next year. 
The group decided to cut output by an extra 500,000 barrels a day as they try to support the price of energy and bolster their revenues. But the decision was not easy: they do not want to hand over too much business to the United States, which keeps pumping more oil and flooding the market.
“We have decided to reduce production by 500,000 barrels a day through the first quarter of next year,” said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak.
The cuts come on top of a reduction of 1.2 million barrels a day that they have been observing for the past three years.
The sticking point in the talks, which dragged on over two days, appears to have been how to share the cuts among the 14 OPEC countries and nations like Russia that have been coordinating their production with the cartel in recent years.
Saudi Arabia has been bearing the burden of the largest share of production cuts recently. But some countries including Iraq and Russia have been pumping more than expected, dampening the overall impact on markets.
Analysts note that if countries are already not complying with the current agreement, agreeing in principle could be pointless.
Investors seemed impressed by OPEC's resolve, however, pushing up energy prices sharply.
The price of oil had risen in recent days on expectations for a production cut and gained further on Friday. Brent, the international benchmark, jumped 86 cents to $64.25 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark gained 77 cents to $59.20 a barrel.
It's unclear whether energy prices will continue to rise, however. Even as the members of the cartel cut production, there is more oil coming to market from non-OPEC nations, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana. That could make up for any cuts from OPEC and Russia."
Saudi restaurants no longer need to segregate women and men,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/saudi-restaurants-longer-segregate-women-men-67579020,"
Women in Saudi Arabia will no longer need to use separate entrances from men or sit behind partitions at restaurants in the latest measure announced by the government that upends a major hallmark of conservative restrictions that had been in place for decades. 
The decision, which essentially erodes one of the most visible gender segregation restrictions in place, was quietly announced Sunday in a lengthy and technically worded statement by the Municipal and Rural Affairs Ministry. 
While some restaurants and cafes in the coastal city of Jiddah and Riyadh's upscale hotels had already been allowing unrelated men and women to sit freely, the move codifies what has been a sensitive issue in the past among traditional Saudis who view gender segregation as a religious requirement. Despite that, neighboring Muslim countries do not have similar rules. 
Restaurants and cafes in Saudi Arabia, including major Western chains like Starbucks, are currently segregated by ""family"" sections allocated for women who are out on their own or who are accompanied by male relatives, and “singles” sections for just men. Many also have separate entrances for women and partitions or rooms for families where women are not visible to single men. In smaller restaurants or cafes with no space for segregation, women are not allowed in. 
Reflecting the sensitive nature of this most recent move, the decision to end requirements of segregation in restaurants was announced in a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The statement listed a number of newly-approved technical requirements for buildings, schools, stores and sports centers , among others. 
The statement noted that the long list of published decisions was aimed at attracting investments and creating greater business opportunities.
Among the regulations announced was “removing a requirement by restaurants to have an entrance for single men and (another) for families.”
Couched between a new regulation about the length of a building's facade and allowing kitchens on upper floors to operate was another critical announcement stating that restaurants no longer need to “specify private spaces”— an apparent reference to partitions.
Across Saudi Arabia, the norm has been that unrelated men and women are not permitted to mix in public. Government-run schools and most public universities remain segregated, as are most Saudi weddings. 
In recent years, however, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed for sweeping social reforms ,with women and men now able to attend concerts and movie theaters that were once banned. He also curtailed the powers of the country's religious police, who had been enforcers of conservative social norms, like gender segregation in public. 
Two years ago, women for the first time were allowed to attend sports events in stadiums in the so-called “family” sections. Young girls in recent years have also been allowed access to physical education and sports in school, a right that only boys had been afforded. 
In August, the kingdom lifted a controversial ban on travel by allowing all citizens — women and men alike — to apply for a passport and travel freely, ending a long-standing guardianship policy that had controlled women’s freedom of movement.
The new rules remove restrictions that had been in place, but do not state that restaurants or cafes have to end segregated entrances or seated areas. Many families in conservative swaths of the country, where women cover their hair and face in public, may prefer eating only at restaurants with segregated spaces.

German factory production drops in Oct as economy struggles,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/german-factory-production-drops-oct-economy-struggles-67538571,"
October factory production dropped in Germany over the previous month in another sign the economy, Europe's largest, is struggling.
The Federal Statistical Office reported Friday that industrial production fell 1.7% in October over September when adjusted for price, seasonal and calendar factors. It was down 5.3% over October 2018.
The agency reported Thursday that industrial orders in October were down 0.4%, suggesting an upturn in production is not likely in the immediate future.
Germany just narrowly avoided entering a recession in the third quarter and ING economist Carsten Brzeski says the data indicate “the German economy is continuing to flirt with stagnation and contraction in the final quarter.”
""Trade conflicts, global uncertainty, and disruption in the automotive industry have put the entire German industry in a headlock, from which it is hard to escape."
Asian shares advance after meager gains on Wall Street,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stocks-fall-early-trading-investors-wait-trade-67518724,"
Shares swung higher in Asia on Friday after a wobbly day of trading on Wall Street as investors awaited a U.S. government jobs report and kept an eye out for developments in China-U.S. trade talks.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.7% to 26,401.47, while the Nikkei 225 in Japan picked up 0.2% to 23,352.81. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.9% to 2,078.77, while the Shanghai Composite index was flat, at 2,899.97. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 6,697.40. Shares also rose in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
Investors are hoping that the world’s two biggest economies will reach a trade deal before new U.S. tariffs go into effect Dec. 15 on some popular products made in China, including smartphones.
“Whether or not U.S.-China can cut a deal remains the obsession; arguably the only game in town heading into ahead of the 15-Dec deadline for the next round of tariffs fall due,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.
Chinese officials said Thursday that hinges on whether the U.S. will agree to roll back some of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump after he began his effort to win trade concessions from Beijing in mid-2018.
“To be sure, there is still no clarity on the deal. But soothing remarks on ‘progress’ from those involved in the talks appears to have infused some hope and cut tensions,” the Mizuho report said.
Investors will be looking for clues into the state of the U.S. economy from the Labor Department’s November tally of hiring by nonfarm employers, to be released later Friday. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.6%.
“You’ve had some mixed economic data this week, so the market probably wants to wait and see what we get tomorrow morning,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.
The S&P 500 index rose 0.2% to 3,117.43. Even with the latest gain, the benchmark index is on track for a weekly loss, though it’s still up 24.4% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% to 27,677.79.
The Nasdaq added less than 0.1% to 8,570.70, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 0.94 points, also less than 0.1%, to 1,614.83.
Stocks fell early in the week after President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t mind waiting for a trade deal beyond the 2020 elections. The indexes rebounded Wednesday on a report that Washington and Beijing could be on track for a trade deal before the new tariffs kick in next week.
Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers Thursday. Apple rose 1.5%. The sector has much to gain, or lose, in trade negotiations because many of the companies rely heavily on China for sales and supplies.
Communication services stocks also rose. ViacomCBS led the sector, climbing 3.6%. It was the first day of trading for the newly combined company.
United Airlines slipped 0.4% after it said CEO Oscar Munoz is stepping down from his post and will become executive chairman. The airline said that President J. Scott Kirby will be its new CEO.
Munoz led the company through a choppy period, and in 2017 gave up his bonus after the forcible removal of a ticketed passenger led to widespread criticism.
Benchmark crude oil lost 21 cents to $58.22 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was unchanged at $58.43 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, shed 28 cents to $63.11 a barrel.
The dollar fell to 108.69 Japanese yen from 108.74 yen on Thursday. The euro was steady at $1.1107.

Minister: Brazil can't stop deforestation without help,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/minister-brazil-stop-deforestation-67576640,"
Brazil can’t stop deforestation in the Amazon without the help of rich countries, the country’s environment minister said at the United Nations' two-week climate change conference.
Ricardo Salles, who declined to set a target for limiting deforestation in the coming year, said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that his country is committed to reducing illegal activity, but needs the support of developed nations.
""We are willing to do whatever is necessary to do so, but we need that back up,” Salles said. “That back up was promised many years ago and we're still expecting the rich countries to participate in a proper way. Proportional funds are really are what are going to be needed for that task.”
While participating in the climate conference known as COP25, Salles is working to assure others of the environmental policies of Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro has squabbled with some European leaders this year over his commitment to protecting the Amazon. He has worried environmental activists and others by criticizing Brazil's environment regulator and by calling for more development in the Amazon region. He also accused activists groups, without evidence, of having set fires in that region to undermine his administration. 
Deforestation in the 12 months through July reached the highest annual rate in 11 years. Brazil’s annual deforestation report released in November showed a nearly 30% jump from the prior year in the Amazon, which lost 3,769 square miles (9,760 square kilometers) of forest.
Salles said developed nations should help Brazil on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 on tackling the effects of climate change. The article says monetary compensation mechanisms must be created to help developing countries.
Brazil already receives money from wealthy nations, namely Germany and Norway, to fight deforestation in the vast Amazon rainforest. Norway alone has donated $1.2 billion to Brazil’s Amazon Fund since its creation in 2008.
However, both European nations have suspended contributions, citing the continued deforestation and questioning whether the government wants to stop it. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported this past week that the fund's disbursements this year were the smallest since 2013 and said zero projects were approved despite the fact the fund has 2.2 billion reais ($530 million) available.
Salles in the past has questioned the fund’s effectiveness. He said in the interview that Brazil is negotiating with the two European countries to restart the program. He said they exchanged draft documents, and he expects them to meet next week to discuss new terms of the fund.
Brazil now has “an appropriate approach on the problem of deforestation,'' Salles said.
He said the government is putting a new emphasis on balancing protection with efforts to develop biological resources that can provide livings for people in the Amazon region.
“If we don't solve the economic development for more than 20 million Brazilians who live there and people who need to have this sustainable, from both a financial and environmental perspective, they will be easily co-opted by illegal activities,” Salles said. “It is a huge effort to attract the private sector to participate.”

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says his government rejects Democratic lawmakers’ plan to allow U.S. inspectors to check Mexican factories for labor law compliance.
Mexico wants the U.S. Congress to approve a new North American trade accord before U.S. elections next year complicate the picture. Democrats are concerned Mexico’s unrepresentative unions have led to low wages that drain manufacturing jobs from the U.S.
López Obrador noted Mexico had passed reforms requiring free and fair union elections in its factories and approved a budget for monitoring. He says some Democrats continue raising concerns about implementation and compliance and requested inspectors.
He says, “We don’t accept that.”
Mexico countered with an idea of panels that would include representatives of both countries and a third nation to rule on controversies."
What will driving be like in 2030? Experts offer a few clues,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/driving-2030-experts-offer-clues/story?id=67375709,"
Your car, unfortunately, will not fly a la ""The Jetsons"" in the next decade.

It will, however, likely be a crossover SUV that still requires a human driver. That Uber or Lyft ride? Expect an autonomous vehicle to pick you up in certain cities. Keys, like manual transmissions, will fade into oblivion. Gasoline refineries will still be in business but charging stations for electric vehicles will become more prevalent, experts say.

The next 10 years for the automobile could look very similar to the decade we're about to close out -- or radically different, depending on tech innovations, government regulations and new players in the highly competitive industry.

Here's what some longtime experts are predicting for drivers and automakers alike.

Mobility

Cellphones are expected to supplant the key fob and be able to remotely start a vehicle, lock it and locate its parked location, similar to what can be found now in Lincolns and Hyundais. This technology will go from niche to ubiquitous, according to Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Cox Automotive.

""The industry is on the cusp of incredibly exciting things,"" he said. ""Drivers will have the ability to connect to the car even when they're not near it. The car will be a rolling piece of information.""
Electrification

Electric vehicles will still face challenges in the market but they’ll become more common on the road than they are now.

""They won't be the majority of vehicles sold in the U.S. in 10 years,"" said Brauer. ""Electric vehicles do not make sense in a lot of areas. But we will see viable options for driving a longer distance in these cars.""
Brandon Mason, director and U.S. mobility leader at PwC, expects mass adoption of electric vehicles will take place before driverless cars go mainstream. Pure EVs account for 1% of the U.S. market now. That number could rise to 10% in the next decade, he said.

""Automakers are making big bets on EVs,"" he explained. ""There's a significant amount of capital in EVs now. But we won't see an inflection point until the middle of the next decade. Battery packs are still cost-prohibitive.""

China and Europe will continue to lead the way in electrification from a regulatory standpoint, according to Mark Wakefield, automotive analyst and managing director at Alix Partners.
Like Mason, Wakefield forecasts EVs to account for 10% of the U.S. auto market by 2030.

""No one is doubting this is the future, but the question is how long"" before EVs are widespread, he said.
Hybrids will no longer be ""special"" but rather the status quo in the coming decade, said Eric Tingwall, print director at Car and Driver magazine.

""Some form of electric propulsion will be in all new vehicles sold,"" he noted, adding that EVs could make up an even bigger portion of the market -- 20% -- by the end of 2030.
Autonomous vehicles

Self-driving cars could replace taxis and ride-sharing vehicles in urban cities, Brauer said.

Like electric vehicles, high costs are another hurdle for automakers to overcome with autonomous vehicles, Mason pointed out. Vehicles with level four and five autonomy will arrive by 2030 at the earliest, he said.

""There's several hundred thousand dollars of technology in each of these vehicles,"" he said. ""I don't see private ownership of self-driving cars happening for the foreseeable future.""
Steering wheels and pedals are not going away in the next decade and young people will still be required to pass driving tests, according to Tingwall. But autonomous systems will be more ""capable and confident,"" he said.

""Change is happening very quickly in the auto industry,"" he said. The timelines for a lot of this technology, however, are ""ambitious,"" he added.

Newer systems will allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road -- but only in certain conditions, like highway driving, he said.

""There will be some type of advanced cruise control,"" he said. ""You can watch YouTube videos and check social media.""
Wakefield said he cannot wait for the day when cars will be able to drive themselves to dealers for maintenance or be summoned by owners in a parking lot.

""A car in 2030 will be able to do so many more things for you,"" he said. ""2020 cars will look like relics.""

A shrinking industry?

Brauer anticipates smaller, independent marques will be acquired by industry giants. China will likely continue its buying streak, adding to its portfolio of brands.

""Could China own General Motors in 10 years? It's not out of the question,"" he said.

Consolidation in the automotive market could accelerate, Mason agreed. But the impact on drivers may be modest.

""If the number of nameplates is reduced, it's not necessarily a bad thing for consumers,"" he said. ""There will still be plenty of options for consumers.""

He added, ""I see a lot of disruption in the industry over the next decade.""

Sales slowdown

Tingwall expects new car sales to dip as transaction prices rise.

""Anybody looking for an affordable vehicle will be in a crossover,"" he said. ""We'll see a middle class that doesn't have the purchasing power to buy a new car. The market will shrink for new vehicles.""

Subscription services will also gain in popularity as fewer new cars are purchased.

""They'll be like a lease, but for a shorter term,"" he explained.

Automakers, in an effort to cut costs, will team up to share vehicle platforms and powertrains, partnerships that exist currently between Ford and Volkswagen and Ford and Rivian, Tingwall said. Third parties in Asia will build these platforms, homogenizing the parts under the car's hood. But not all automakers may survive the next decade.

""If there is an economic downturn, the industry will be squeezed,"" he said. ""We will certainly lose a few niche, high-end automakers.""
Wakefield forecasts auto sales to stay strong in the coming years, but a downturn in the market ""will come.""

The market ""is cyclical,"" he explained, noting that sales could drop to 15 million annual units from the recent trend of 17 million units.

""We won't stay at 15 million for years. It will recover,"" he said.

Crossovers will be the vehicle du jour for drivers in the next decade, further cementing the demise of the sedan.

""CUVs will be dominant and what everyone will be driving,"" Wakefield said.  "
"Indie booksellers persevere despite Amazon, rising costs",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/indie-booksellers-persevere-amazon-rising-costs-67656714,"NEW YORK -- 
Pete Mulvihill has felt optimistic enough about selling books that he bought a third bookstore within the past two months.
“The industry is much better than it was — the last four to five years have been pretty healthy,” says Mulvihill, who owns three Green Apple Books and Browser Books shops in San Francisco. The stores have survived the devastation the independent book business suffered after Amazon.com began selling books online and at lower prices in 1995. 
But Mulvihill still faces challenges. He's taken on this latest store because of economies of scale — it's cheaper to spread administrative costs across three stores instead of two. Like other booksellers, he's had to change the merchandise he stocks to keep customers coming in and buying even though they can get books cheaper — for example, on Amazon. Although books are his primary items, as much as 15% of sales come from what's known as non-book merchandise including gifts, music, games, cards, apparel. He also sells used and rare books. 
A variety of merchandise is particularly necessary during the holidays, when, Mulvilhill says, “there are only so many books that will sell. People come in and they want to buy their uncle a puzzle.”
While book retailers like Mulvihill are cautious, statistics from the American Booksellers Association, a trade group for independent booksellers, show a recovery from the industry's darkest days. The ABA had 1,887 member companies as of May 15, up nearly 35% from 1,401 in 2009. The number of members' stores totaled 2,524 in May, up more than half from 1,651. Another sign of improving health: the number of books indies have sold. Book sales rose 5% in 2018 from 2017, and in 2017 they were up 2.6% from 2016.
Independent sellers are doing better even as Amazon continues to thrive online and to open its own stores, so far mostly in big metropolitan areas. Amazon does not break out how much revenue it takes in from books. Barnes & Noble, which has been struggling as Amazon continues growing, also does not break out book revenue.
Indies are doing better partly because customers feel a deep connection, even affection, for the shops where they can find kindred spirits in owners and staffers, and where they can touch and leaf through the books. Social media, which helps bookstores build and nurture those relationships, also helps sales, says Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer at the ABA. 
So does the growing “shop local” movement. “Literally millions of consumers are deciding to spend a certain amount of their discretionary income on locally owned stores,” Cullen says.
The indies are also helped by the fact more people are reading printed books rather than electronic versions — sales of e-books fell 37% between 2014 and 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers, an industry group.
Still, independent book selling remains a low-margin and challenging business. Owners who sell toys and gifts do so because those items are more profitable than books; there's more price flexibility with non-book merchandise because publishers print the maximum price on dust jackets. Some shops have installed cafes, making their stores more inviting. These features became popular with the growth of the now-defunct Borders chain, and Barnes & Noble includes them in its stores.
“The way to get people to go to stores is to give them an experience, something they can't get online,"" says Tom Meyvis, a marketing professor at New York University's Stern School of Business whose work focuses on consumer behavior. ""People want to spend some time browsing in stores and with books, this is one of the more agreeable shopping experiences.
But Christine Onorati, who has WORD bookstores in Brooklyn, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey, and has tried these strategies, worries about indies' ability to sustain their growth. 
“We’ve gotten to the point where flat is great,"" she says. “If you can stay flat, you’re hanging on and you’re doing OK."" 
And bookstores still shut down, especially if rents are so high an owner can't even break even or if changing demographics mean a neighborhood can't support a store. Labor costs are also a challenge in states and cities where the minimum wage is rising.
‘’It essentially comes down to more than anything, rising payroll costs, but also costs like rent and administrative costs,"" says Bradley Graham, who has owned Politics and Prose in Washington, D.C., for nearly nine of its 35 years. In Washington, the minimum wage, which was $12.50 in 2017, has gone up 75 cents each year and is now $14; it rises to $15 July 1. The city also has laws requiring companies to give workers paid sick, medical and family leave.
But, Onorati says, “the good news is, when customers walk into the store, there’s an unwritten understanding they could buy cheaper else. They say, ‘I’ in here because I want to be here."" 
The human touch that small bookstores offer draws people in, says Chris Morrow, co-owner of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vermont, and Saratoga Springs, New York. 
“Ït's our ability to listen well and ask questions and connect people with the right book at the right time,"" he says. For example, someone who has suffered a loss and is looking for a book on grieving.
Some indies persevere partly because they have legendary status well beyond the cities and towns where they're located. Politics and Prose is one, and others include Denver's Tattered Cover and BookPeople in Austin, Texas. A location in a college or university town or a tourism area can boost sales.
Waucoma Bookstore in Hood River, Oregon, gets steady business from people visiting the Columbia River Gorge and the Cascade mountains.
“We definitely have tourists who come in for the bookstore experience,” co-owner Jenny Cohen says. “A lot of them have commented that they like the shop because they no longer have a bookstore in their community.""
