US threatens tax on champagne and French cheese,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50636521,"The Trump administration is threatening to slap import taxes on $2.4bn worth of French goods, including cheese, champagne, make-up and handbags.The planned tariffs come in response to a new French digital services tax that would affect companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook.France, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes.But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted.French minister Bruno Le Maire called the US threat to impose tariffs in response to the tax ""unacceptable"" and suggested France would be prepared to retaliate.  France has long been concerned that US technology giants are avoiding taxes in the European Union. France says taxes should be based on where the digital activity - browsing the page - takes place, not where firms have their headquarters.  It is not the only country to raise concerns and a group of nations are drawing up new multilateral rules via the OECD. But France does not want to wait for that to bear fruit, so this summer drew up its own tax.It is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than €750m ($850m; £670m), of which at least €25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about €400m this year.About 30 companies are expected to pay it, mostly US firms such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon has already responded by raising fees for French businesses by 3%.Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative (USTR), has published a list of French products that could face tariffs, including champagne and sparkling wine, Roquefort and other cheeses, make-up, handbags, and homeware such as porcelain and bone china.Some of the tariffs are as high as 100% of the import price, and are likely to push up the price of these products for US consumers.However, before the tariffs are confirmed, there will now be what the US calls a period for public comment, including a hearing in Washington in January.The US says the French tax unfairly targets some US multinationals. Mr Lighthizer said the threat of tariffs  was intended to deter other countries from taking similar steps.The trade official said the move ""sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies"". Mr Lighthizer warned that the US intended to look into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey. A digital sales tax has long been on the UK agenda too.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's flagship election pledge - to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030 - was to be funded, at least in part, by a tax on ""multinationals"". In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also backed the idea, calling out the so-called ""FAANG"" stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - as paying ""virtually nothing"". The Tory manifesto pledges its own Digital Services Tax to fund improvements in broadband infrastructure, among other things.Both leaders are capitalising on the growing momentum in Europe to tax tech firms based on their sales in a country - rather than profits, which are often funnelled through counties with a lower tax rate, such as Ireland.But while promising a ""Google tax"" sounds great on the campaign trail, it only strengthens the view in Washington that American success stories are being unfairly targeted. And the move today suggests the US is ready to start fighting back.Here's what might happen next: France has said it would drop its digital tax if Europe could, as a bloc, come up with an alternative that's consistent across the Union; a strength-in-numbers move that would be more difficult for the US to counteract. But the UK, post-Brexit, would be on its own - and needs to stay in Washington's good graces.The US reaction to France's digital services tax suggests it would not go down well if the UK were to follow suit.Earlier this year, US firms were at pains to make it clear to the US Trade Representative that any such UK digital tax would be a big concern for them, with some even suggesting it would need to be dealt with before trade negotiations could go ahead.The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam says the issue has split the UK government, with some in the current cabinet believing the tech tax would be an obstacle to a future US trade deal.While the matter has not yet been openly discussed, in the recently leaked trade documents UK negotiators clearly anticipate that the issue would emerge during later parts of the process.The US technology sector has welcomed the Trump administration's tougher stance, although it still hopes for a negotiated settlement before the tariffs are imposed. Jennifer McCloskey, vice-president for policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include the major US tech firms, said the French tax was ""discriminatory"" and welcomed the USTR's ""strong trade response"".However, the US move has unnerved investors. Mr Lighthizer's comment that he sees the French tax as part of a ""growing protectionism of EU member states,"" raised concerns that this latest spat could be part of a wider trade war with the EU that has drawn in car companies and planemaker Airbus.Shares in leading French luxury-goods companies fell on Tuesday, with LVMH, Kering and Hermes down 1.4% to 1.5% in early trading.Some US business lobby groups have warned against tariffs because of fears of escalating another trade fight, despite their opposition to the French law.The US Chamber of Commerce, for example, had said tariffs ""may elicit additional rounds of retaliatory measures that represent a substantial risk to US economic growth and job creation"".

How to make phone batteries that last longer,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50151543,"When Professor Akira Yoshino was developing a new battery technology in his laboratory in the early 1980s, he didn't think it would amount to much.""At the time, we thought it mainly would be used in 8mm video cameras,"" he laughs.He was well off the mark. These days you are never more than a few feet away from a lithium-ion battery, as they power mobile phones and all sorts of other electronics, from toothbrushes to electric scooters.In recognition of that success, Prof Yoshino was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.But despite improvements, even the most advanced lithium-ion batteries can only store a fraction of the energy of a similar weight of petrol or jet fuel.And that is curbing ambitions for even smaller and lighter devices - and more ambitious projects like electric powered aviation.Batteries need to make progress, admits Prof Yoshino, but thankfully, ""there's a lot of interesting approaches"".And ""the solid state battery, I think, is a promising one,"" he says.Solid state batteries can store 50% more energy than lithium-ion, says Douglas Campbell, chief executive of Solid Power, a Colorado university spin-off.They are more stable as well. In lithium-ion batteries the gel inside, the electrolyte, can combust.In 2016, Samsung recalled 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 handsets after fires involving their lithium-ion batteries.Solid state batteries replace that gel with less flammable solid polymers or ceramics. But the batteries being developed by Mr Campbell's firm still require lithium in its metallic form and that's a problem because it is a hard metal to work with.Another problem is that lithium metal isn't yet refined on an industrial scale, so just getting enough could be difficult, according to Mr Campbell.But despite those worries, solid state batteries have ""had the breakthrough in basic research, and research and development for mass production techniques is progressing,"" says Prof Yoshino.He thinks it could take another 10 years for solid state batteries to compete with lithium-ion in terms of price.The big prize in the market is batteries for electric cars.The number of electric vehicles in the world will balloon to 125 million by 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts.Battery innovation is ""pretty much driven by whatever's happening in the electric vehicle market"", says Rory McCarthy, an analyst at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. More Technology of BusinessMr McCarthy says the challenge for solid state and other new technologies is to compete with lithium-ion plants, which are getting bigger and bigger, making their batteries cheaper.It takes a new battery factory four to five years to get close to full capacity and 10 years to make its money back, he adds.Lithium-ion technology itself is not a dead end.  ""We're learning some new principles we haven't thought of before,"" says Prof Yoshino.That includes the movement of lithium-ions inside batteries. ""We thought we understood that,"" he adds.  But now scientists are having to revisit their understanding, since it ""is not what we expected"".""Yes, it goes on and on it never ends"", he laughs.Gene Berdichevsky says that it's only lithium-ion batteries that can make a ""meaningful"" impact on batteries in the near future and spur the mass adoption of electric vehicles.His California-based company, Sila Nanotechnologies, is developing lithium-ion batteries that can potentially deliver a 40% improvement in energy density.They are doing that by by replacing the graphite anodes (the part of the battery where the current flows in) with silicon.""We need continued investment and innovation in lithium-ion batteries,"" he says.Better battery density could make big differences in the way we live.Aeroplanes release 500 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year.But with better batteries, aircraft can use cleaner power and that revolution is already underway.This year's Paris air show saw a working all-electric prototype commercial aircraft, made by the Israeli start-up, Eviation. US regional airline Cape Air has placed a double-digit order. Meanwhile Canada's Harbour Air said in March it aims to become the world's first all-electric airline.With 30% of flights under 300 miles, short haul flight should be easy to electrify, says Los Angeles start-up Wright Electric.And much denser batteries could also electrify big lorries that today rely on fossil fuels.Meanwhile, for some better batteries could change their lives.""I have an off-road chair with six wheels,"" says Curt Oswalt, a former US air force translator who uses a battery-powered wheelchair after a 2002 injury. ""My batteries first started acting up roughly two years ago,"" he says.One night, unable to sleep, he went for a 01:00 stroll around his neighbourhood in the Texan countryside.""My battery indicator went from reading three-quarters full to dead, in under three seconds,"" he says. Stranded, he had to wait under a street light until 04:30, when a sheriff found him and helped him home.A more recent battery failure has meant he's been unable to leave his house unassisted for nine days.""So yes,"" he says, ""looking forward to better batteries!"""
Loan sharks cash in on Black Friday spending spree,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50560803,"She'd not borrowed a lot. And she'd more than paid it back. Six times over. But when one mother looked up from her washing-up to see the man who'd lent her a few hundred pounds standing with her two teenage daughters, she was so frightened that she continued to pay back even more. The harrowing tale is told by Cath Williams, who heads up government agency England Illegal Money Lending Team. Her team both gives support to people who have borrowed money from a loan shark, and prosecutes the illegal money lenders.""That image was what he could do if he chose to,"" she says. ""It's psychological warfare.""In other cases, loan sharks have threatened to tell neighbours or colleagues about someone's financial problems, or taken precious wedding rings to ensure further, often unnecessary repayments.But one of the most potent pieces of emotional blackmail is specific to this time of year - that desire to spend in the Black Friday sales, or the need to buy Christmas presents. ""The pressures at this time of year are extraordinary. You need your heating on, the car is more likely to break down in winter,"" says Ms Williams. ""Loan sharks will prey on that, extending loans, or giving extra time of repaying, or offering more money even if you don't want it.""  This week, the sales bonanza that includes Black Friday will see Brits splurge almost £8bn online alone. It's a temptation that community groups, charities and housing associations want families to try and avoid. In Bradford, the local Credit Union has joined forces with charity Artworks to create a day of distracting crafting - with the charming Yorkshire title: ""Buy Nowt Day"".About 300 people are expected through the doors, to do something fun and creative for free, like making decorations, gifts or cards - and crucially not spending a penny under pressure.""The starting gun for Christmas is being pulled back earlier,"" says the Bradford Credit Union's financial inclusion officer Ian Brewer. ""They're feeling pressure from children, they're feeling pressure from society to spend that money earlier."" Mr Brewer insists he's not anti-business, but likens the flash sale events to a sweet shop window, and wants people to think twice and spend wisely. ""By doing this now, it's not leaving any money available for later."" Trying to point a finger of blame, or even stop the sales is fruitless. Black Friday has become crucial. A lot of shops make 25% of their annual sales in November and December - according to analysts IMRG.But this year, the figures may not even add up for the retailers, with prices already slashed since summer to tempt consumers. IMRG expect sales and revenues to be near flat.So even though retailers may have mixed feeling about the event, the sales and deals are expected, even demanded, by consumers. Allana Harrison works for Bradford's biggest social landlord, Incommunities, helping residents manage bills and budgets. Having those careful plans wrecked by a Black Friday splurge has become a common theme.""When you've got things on offer, £20 or £30 off, people are not just buying one thing, but adding others things to that basket,"" she says. ""Then they can't make their priority bills. So they're borrowing just to be able to afford Christmas presents for the children."" Nationally, across England, the Illegal Lending Team has seen a real shift in who is contacting them for support. ""It's not single mums on benefits. Last year we had over 50% of the people we helped in work,"" explains Ms Williams. ""We've got the highest number of homeowners we've ever seen."" She and her team have organised victim support for thousands of Brits, many of whom have seen families break down, or been pushed close to suicide.Often loan sharks can initially seem benign, such as coming with a friendly recommendation through a neighbour, at the school gates, or even in the workplace. Crucially there's seldom paperwork, nor clarity on what must be repaid. From Shakespeare to Dickens, the money-lenders are older than literature. And the most famous of them all, Ebenezer Scrooge, saw December as a fruitful time for business. But after a series of terrifying visits, even Scrooge changed his ways. Campaigners hope it won't take that for families. "
Is China gaining an edge in AI?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50255191,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Sky to build huge new Elstree film studio,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50641745,"Media giant Sky is to build huge new film studios near the existing Elstree production site outside London, creating 2,000 jobs.The 32-acre development will be used by Sky, other Comcast-owned firms including NBC Universal, and be open to third parties.Sky predicted up to £3bn would be invested in new production at the site over the next five years.The UK's film and television sector has performed strongly in recent years.Hit shows such as The Crown and Games of Thrones have been filmed using UK facilities as the battle between Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services has intensified.Sky spends £7bn a year on production in Europe, including football rights, and plans to double the amount it spends on making its own content to £1bn per year by 2024.Sky Studios chief executive Gary Davey said it was hard to keep up with the increasing demand for high quality content, given that it typically takes three years to bring a project to the screen.Mr Davey said recent successes, such as the Sky-HBO joint production, Chernobyl, and HBO smash-hit Game of Thrones, had a high proportion of European actors, and showed US audiences were ready to embrace productions made overseas.Choosing to build the new studios at Elstree meant there would already be a pool of UK production talent available, he added.The UK now boasts a world-leading film industry, supported by wide-ranging tax relief, including for television and animation. According to the British Film Institute (BFI), UK films grossed $9.4bn (£7.2bn) in 2018, a 23% share of the global box office take.There is a long history of film making at Elstree. The existing studios, in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, date back to 1925, and were used by George Lucas when he filmed the original Star Wars trilogy.The new Sky studies will be located close by on land owned by Legal and General, which will fund the development and lease the studios back to Sky.The studios, which will cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build, will have 14 sound stages.Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, said the plans were ""another development in the modernisation of British industry"".Over the last five years Legal and General has made £20bn of investments in similar projects."
Trump to 'restore' tariffs on Brazil and Argentina,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50633500,"US President Donald Trump has said he will place tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina.He justified the move saying those countries' weak currencies had made it harder for US food exports to compete.""Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies, which is not good for our farmers,"" Mr Trump said. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said he would seek talks with Mr Trump.""Their economy is not comparable with ours, it's many times bigger. I don't see this as retaliation,"" Mr Bolsonaro said in a radio interview with Brazil's Radio Itatiaia.""I'm going to call him so that he doesn't penalise us. Our economy basically comes from commodities, it's what we've got,"" he said.Argentine production minister Dante Sica said he would also request a conversation with his US counterparts. Despite Mr Trump's claims, both countries have taken steps over the past two years to try to bolster their currencies, which have dropped sharply amid domestic political turmoil and economic woes. The plans for the tariffs, which Mr Trump announced on Twitter, were a surprise.While Mr Trump last year imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium on national security grounds, he granted some exceptions amid outcry abroad and in the US, where many manufacturers rely on foreign metal imports.Argentina and Brazil, which agreed to limits on their metals exports, were among the countries to receive waivers.The US is Brazil's biggest customer for steel and Brazil is the world's 10th biggest exporter of steel, according to the US Department of Commerce.Steel accounts for 3.7% of the total goods Brazil exported in 2018.The White House provided few details about the plans for the tariffs. Analysts said such measures raise legal questions since Mr Trump is acting so long after the initial tariff decision.However, for Mr Trump, farmers in rural states are an important block of voters, and they have had a difficult time in the past year.Countries around the world retaliated with higher import duties on US farm exports in response to Mr Trump's metals tariffs.China has also hit farm goods with tariffs as part of the US-China trade fight over policies related to technology and government subsidies. Meanwhile, Chinese buyers have looked to Brazil and Argentina as an alternative.Across the country, farm bankruptcies surged 24% in the 12 months to October 2018, according to analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation.By Daniel Gallas, BBC South America business correspondentMr Trump accused Argentina and Brazil of ""presiding over a massive devaluation"" - with exports of both countries being now cheaper and more competitive due to the weak currency.But Argentina and Brazil are not happy with the devaluation and both central banks have been intervening to prop up the sliding currencies.Brazil's currency, the real, has reached an all-time low, as investors feel uncertain about sluggish economic recovery and the future reforms promised by the government.In Argentina, investors are on the sidelines waiting for a new direction to the economy, which will be set by president-elect Alberto Fernandez when he takes office next week.This crisis will be a test for Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, often called ""Trump of the Tropics"", who boasts a close relationship with his US counterpart."
"TikTok sent user data to China, US lawsuit claims",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50640110,"Video-sharing app TikTok has been hit with a class action lawsuit in the US that claims it transferred ""vast quantities"" of user data to China.The lawsuit accuses the company of ""surreptitiously"" taking content without user consent. Owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok has built up a keen US fan base.TikTok, which is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide, has previously said it does not store US data on Chinese servers.However, the platform is facing mounting pressure in North America over data collection and censorship concerns.The lawsuit filed in a Californian court last week claims TikTok ""clandestinely... vacuumed up and transferred to servers in China vast quantities of private and personally-identifiable user data"". It alleges the data could be used to identify, profile and track users in the US ""now and in the future"". The plaintiff is named as Misty Hong, a Californian-based university student. Ms Hong claims she downloaded the app this year but did not create an account. Months later she alleges the firm had created an account for her, and ""surreptitiously"" took draft videos she had created but never intended to publish. The data was sent to two servers in China, backed by Tencent and Alibaba.The lawsuit also argues TikTok unfairly profits from ""secret harvesting"" of private data by using that data to derive ""vast targeted-advertising revenues and profits"".  TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The platform has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. They use the app to share 15-second videos that typically involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and unusual editing tricks.Alongside its rapid expansion, concerns have grown - chiefly in the US - over the potential to compromise users' privacy. US lawmakers have put pressure on the company to clear up allegations that it is beholden to the Chinese state. TikTok has hit back against claims of government interference, arguing it ""does not remove content"" based on Chinese sensitivities.In October, the company said it had never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content ""and would not do so if asked"".TikTok operates a similar but separate version of the app in China, known as Douyin. It says all US user data is stored in the United States, with a backup in Singapore.Still, the company found itself in hot water last week, apologising to a US teenager who was blocked from the service after she posted a viral clip criticising China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims.The company later lifted the ban."
Trump 'signs off' on deal to pause China trade war,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50765743,"The US and China are close to signing a trade deal that averts another round of tariffs due to start on Sunday.The deal could be announced as soon as Friday, after US President Donald Trump reportedly signed off on the terms. The US has agreed to remove some tariffs as part of the agreement. In exchange, China would boost purchases of US farm goods.Many of the more difficult issues are still to be addressed, but the progress sent US share markets to record highs.""It's a good starting point,"" Chamber of Commerce head of international affairs Myron Brilliant told broadcaster CNBC after meeting with White House officials.A deal would deliver a victory to Mr Trump, who is under political pressure, with debate on his impeachment underway in the US Congress. He tweeted earlier on Thursday that the US and China were ""very"" close to an agreement.""They want it and so do we!"" he wrote.Previous truces have collapsed and without a formal announcement or presentation of a written agreement, many remained wary. The hints of progress on Thursday still sent the main US stock indexes up about 1%. The US reportedly offered to halve tariff rates on about $350bn worth of Chinese goods, some of which had climbed as high as 25%. However, the deal is not expected to address many of the more difficult issues that triggered the fight, like China's subsidies for certain industries.As described, the potential agreement falls short of what the US initially said were its goals, said Jennifer Hillman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former trade official.""This should NOT be described as a trade agreement,"" she wrote on Twitter.""It is a purchase and sale agreement that does virtually nothing to address substantive concerns of US (+rest of the world) with China's trade practices.""Mr Trump has repeatedly declared progress toward a deal that would end the trade war, which has seen tariffs imposed on more than $450bn worth of US-China trade and weighed on the global economy.In October, he announced that the two sides had agreed to terms for a ""Phase One"" deal, but negotiations dragged on. Without progress, the US had threatened to impose tariffs on more than $150bn worth of Chinese exports on 15 December.Unlike earlier rounds of tariffs, this one was slated to fall largely on everyday items, including smartphones, children's books, footwear and clothing, heightening the economic stakes, since the US economy is driven by consumer spending.Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that US economic growth could be 0.4% lower next year, without some sort of deal to avoid the next tariffs and roll back some of those already in place.White House officials have downplayed the risks, arguing the tariffs are aimed at making China give up ""unfair"" trade practices, such as alleged intellectual property theft."
'I rent one item of clothing a month',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50627492,"Emily Broughton, 24, a lifestyle blogger and entrepreneur, spends £200 a month on clothing on average, but she now spends part of that budget on renting clothes.""I love to rent because you can get such amazing high quality items and try new looks,"" she says. Once a regular High Street shopper, buying lots of cheap outfits, she now prefers to buy either second-hand designer clothes from vintage stores and charity shops, or to rent fashion from a range of platforms  such as By Rotation, Hirestreet and My Wardrobe HQ.""A few years ago I'd be going round to my friends' houses and sharing clothes with them from their wardrobes, and rental is opening that up,"" says Ms Broughton, whose blog Saving the Grace focuses on sustainable living.Not all the outfits are expensive - she says she has rented clothes for as little as £10 for three days and typically rents one item of clothing a month.Shoppers like Ms Broughton, could help drive a shift in how we shop, claims retail veteran Jane Shepherdson. She's the new chairman of a high-end fashion rental start-up called My Wardrobe HQ, which is hoping to make renting clothes rather than buying them popular in the UK. Ms Shepherdson, who has spent 35 years in the industry and is credited with building Topshop into a global brand, sees renting designer clothes as an opportunity for people to be able to wear beautiful clothing, shoes and accessories that they wouldn't typically be able to afford.For example, she envisages women renting a dress or a fancy pair of Jimmy Choo shoes for £60 to wear to a wedding or fancy function, rather than buying them for several hundred pounds. But she also sees the service as a way for people who have bought expensive garments to earn some money by hiring them out several times in a season.""Anything we can do to slow down the mass purchasing of clothes and share each piece a little bit more, the better. It's kind of trying to reward a more conscientious way of purchasing,"" she told the BBC.""I don't think it's going to solve the fast fashion problem immediately. What I hope is that in the longer term it will start to change people's behaviour slowly.""It's a potentially lucrative sector. US rival Rent the Runway, which claims to have pioneered the fashion rental concept in 2009, was recently valued at $1bn (£770m). It has a subscriber base of about 100,000 people who pay a subscription fee of $160 a month for unlimited rentals. However, at £60 per dress, handbag or pair of shoes from My Wardrobe HQ, you'd still need to have a reasonable amount of disposable income in order to be able to afford such a lifestyle. It therefore seems unlikely that renting clothes at this level would appeal to Generation Z and younger millennials who are buying £5 dresses online. Ms Shepherdson acknowledges that it will take a while before the British consumer is ready to spend this much on clothing that they don't get to keep. Emily Broughton, 24, is a lifestyle blogger and entrepreneur focusing on sustainable causes.She told the BBC that she stopped buying fast fashion in July 2018, and prefers to buy either second-hand designer clothes from vintage stores and charity shops, or to rent fashion from a range of platforms  such as By Rotation or Hirestreet.""A few years ago I'd be going round to my friends' houses and sharing clothes with them from their wardrobes, and rental is opening that up,"" says Ms Broughton, whose blog Saving the Grace focuses on sustainable living.""I love to rent because you can get such amazing high quality items and try new looks.""On average, Ms Broughton wears one rented outfit a month, and spends about £200 in total on clothes. Not all the outfits are expensive - she says she has rented clothes for as little as £10 for three days. The idea of renting clothing is not new in itself - in the West, men have rented wedding suits for years, while in Southeast Asia many women now rent several wedding gowns for photoshoots and ceremonies.However, it has never really been a particularly popular option for womenswear, as consumers prefer to own garments, whether they be brand new or secondhand. Popular mainstream brands such as American Eagle, Urban Outfitters and Ann Taylor are already offering retail rental services, while in Europe, major fast fashion retailer H&M recently begun a trial of renting out clothes at its flagship store in Stockholm, Sweden. According to retail expert Natalie Berg, the future of retail is for products to become services, because it helps retailers to retain customer loyalty, as well as staying relevant. She cites several examples of this, such as Ikea renting out furniture, electronic retailer AO renting out washing machines, and sports brand Adidas asking consumers to bring back old worn-out shoes and then trading up for a newer model.""It's about consumers prioritising access over ownership,"" Ms Berg explains.H&M is also using its clothing rental service to offer a new personal styling service, which serves to tie customers to its brand. And although consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious, Ms Berg doesn't think that fast fashion will ever really go away, because cheap clothes are always in demand.She said: ""The reality is that fashion is a remarkably wasteful industry, and I think there's just this growing awareness across demographics that we need to do more as a society to address our culture of waste."""
How China plans to lead in computer chips,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50287485,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22m) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says. "
"Uber: 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50682175,"Uber said it received almost 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the United States in 2017 and 2018.While the number of cases rose in 2018, the rate of incidents dropped by 16%, as the number of journeys was higher.Passengers - as opposed to drivers - accounted for nearly half of those accused of sexual assault.The data was published in a report which Uber said showed its commitment to ""improving safety for Uber and the entire industry"".Uber is facing growing scrutiny around the world, and recently lost its licence to operate in London. The report showed 5,981 sexual assault incidents were reported out of the 2.3bn US trips over the two-year period.Uber claimed 99.9% of the total journeys were concluded without safety issues.Uber said the report was the first comprehensive safety review of its ride-hailing business.""Voluntarily publishing a report that discusses these difficult safety issues is not easy,"" said Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber. ""Most companies don't talk about issues like sexual violence because doing so risks inviting negative headlines and public criticism. But we feel it's time for a new approach."" The company told the BBC there were currently no concrete plans to release safety reports for any non-US markets.This is a hugely significant document that for the first time details the extent to which the gig economy puts people in harm's way. Uber described it as a complex project that was two years in the making, with much of that time spent auditing the data to ensure accuracy. It should be noted that, knowing it would provoke grim headlines, the firm opted to release this data voluntarily. The firm has committed to releasing the report every two years. Now that Uber has proven it can produce this data in a digestible form, it must keep doing so at regular intervals and, eventually, for all its markets around the world. That's not an easy undertaking, but the company can afford it.Continual publication of the report would bring focus and urgency: is Uber's record on safety getting better or worse? Why might that be? Are certain regions safer than others? What can we learn from that?Attention must also turn to the other gig economy firms out there. Lyft - which is facing a lawsuit over sexual assault filed just this week - has no excuses now that its bigger rival has acted.Uber said 3,045 sexual assault reports were made in 2018 compared with 2,936 in 2017. Last year, 1.3 billion trips were completed in the US, up from one billion in 2017.The head of the US National Sexual Violence Resource Center, Karen Baker, welcomed the report, saying it ""provides an opportunity to shed light on how this information-sharing emboldens our work for a safer future"".Passenger safety, in particular sexual violence, have been major challenges for Uber and its US rival Lyft, as well as China's Didi.In November, London's transport regulator announced that Uber would not be granted a new licence to operate after repeated safety issues.The firm has appealed against the ruling and continues to operate during the process."
China exports fall again as US trade war continues,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50704397,"China's exports fell in November as shipments to the US slowed sharply, adding to concerns about the effects of the two nations' trade war. November exports from the world's second largest economy fell 1.1% from a year earlier, the fourth straight fall.Exports to the US were down 23%, the worst such result since February and the twelfth monthly decline in a row.Another round of US tariffs on Chinese goods is due next Sunday, as part of the ongoing trade dispute.On Friday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the 15 December deadline - to impose a new round of tariffs on some $156bn of Chinese exports - remained in place.Potential US-China trade deal could remove tariffsNew warning on global economic slowdownA quick guide to the US-China trade warBeijing and Washington are negotiating a potential deal aimed at de-escalating their trade dispute but so far have failed to agree on details.Economists say that even if negotiations aimed at avoiding the new American duties are successful, many US buyers will have already found alternative suppliers. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks are ""moving right along"".But China says existing tariffs must be scrapped as part of any interim deal.  The 17-month-long trade war has increased the risks of a global recession.  China's policymakers may seek more stimulus measures after growth in the economy cooled to near 30-year lows.Meanwhile, China's imports unexpectedly rose 0.3% in November from a year earlier, marking the first year-on-year growth since April.China's trade surplus with the rest of the world fell, but was still more than $38bn for the month."
Polluting firms 'will be hit by climate policies',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50706923,"Carbon-intensive firms are likely to lose 43% of their value thanks to policies designed to combat climate change, a report says.Meanwhile the most progressive companies will see an uplift of 33% in their value.The forecast was commissioned by the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Representatives of fossil fuel companies told the BBC they were already adapting their businesses to take climate change into account. But the PRI study suggests major winners and losers will emerge between, and within, big sectors.Car-makers with the swiftest transition to electric vehicles (EVs), for instance, are projected to increase in value by 108%, according to the study by Vivid Economics.Manufacturers slow to move to EVs will see their value fall, as governments realise that petrol and diesel models must be phased out faster for climate targets to be met.Warning on coal Meanwhile, the study predicts that the world’s largest listed coal companies could fall in value by 44%. And the 10 biggest firms in oil and gas could lose 31% of current value.Electric utilities with the strongest strategy for renewables could see values increase by 104%, while laggards could see them fall by two-thirds.Miners producing minerals critical for the transition may see a 54% upside, while those with the smallest share of “green minerals” will witness valuations almost halving.Agricultural firms with high exposure to “sustainable” biofuels and non-beef protein sources could gain at least 10% of current value. Those exposed to under-pressure sectors such as cattle may lose between 15% and 43% - depending on their links with deforestation.The figures are inevitably speculative, and rely on an assumption that politicians will be forced to respond strongly to the growing climate crisis – which, given current political progress, remains debatable.Firms already under pressureBut they do echo the warnings issued by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who said firms ignoring the climate challenge would go bankrupt.Already some insurance firms are refusing to offer cover to new coal-fired power stations because the risk of policy change is so great.The giant AXA, for instance, says it will stop insuring any new coal construction projects, and totally phase out existing insurance and investments in coal in the EU, by 2030.Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the  PRI, said: “This analysis underscores the extent to which markets are under-pricing climate transition risk. “One in five of the world’s most valuable companies are impacted by at least 10% in either direction. “While the  market-level effects of an abrupt policy response to climate change may appear manageable, this masks a much more complex and significant story, with some huge winners and losers emerging between sectors and within them.“We are calling on investors to get real on climate policy risk, and this robust modelling exercise and analysis will enable them to do that.”Industries ""already changing""Mike Tholen, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: “The (oil and gas) majors targeted in this report are actively reducing their carbon footprints, pursuing technologies including Carbon Capture and Storage and diversifying their businesses into a broader mix of renewable energy. “Oil and gas remain an important part of the energy mix for decades to come, and will be used in an increasingly low carbon manner to meet global energy needs.”This confident response will alarm scientists who were warning at the UN climate conference last week that emissions from oil and gas were growing strongly, as coal growth slows. And a spokesperson for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: “Vehicle manufacturers and suppliers are investing vast sums in ultra-low and zero emission vehicles to help meet the same environmental goals. “[Now] we need the right conditions to encourage investment, innovation and a competitive market. “This must include giga-scale battery production and electrified supply chains, massive skills and infrastructure investment and long-term incentives to help companies and consumers make the shift sustainably.”Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin"
Huawei: Boom time in China,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50515426,"Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.More than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.His apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.""I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work,"" says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.  His obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.A year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.Now he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.In October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.""4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet,"" he says.But in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.Industry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market. ""The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies,"" he says. ""As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying,"" Lee adds.Huawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.While western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.On 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.Huawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.The Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.And China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.On a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.Researchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China. They see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.""For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving,"" says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project. China is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.While Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US. Speaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism. ""No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks,"" said Miao Wei.More Technology of BusinessIndustry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.""We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies,"" says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.""With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.""However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G."""
Tesco considers pulling out of Asian markets,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50708728,"The UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, is considering a retreat from markets in Asia with the sale of its profitable operations in Thailand and Malaysia.Analysts say the 2,000 stores, which operate under the Tesco Lotus brand, could be worth more than £7bn.Tesco's only other overseas stores are in Ireland and in central Europe, including Poland and Hungary.The company said it was reviewing its Thai and much smaller Malaysian arms after interest from potential bidders.In a statement, the retailer said it had had received ""inbound interest"", but did not name the potential buyer or buyers. Tesco Lotus employs about 60,000 people.The statement also said the review was at an early stage, and ""no decisions concerning the future of Tesco Thailand or Malaysia have been taken"".The Asian operation, which had combined revenues of £4.9bn, was a ""trophy asset"" and likely to achieve a knock-out price, said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital.A valuation of £6.5bn to £7.2bn seemed ""fair"", according to Bruno Monteyne, analyst at Bernstein.Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec Wealth and Investment, told the BBC's Today programme that Thailand was an important market for Tesco.While Tesco had already withdrawn from ""more mature markets"" such as the US, Japan and Turkey, it had recently announced plans to open another 750 stores in Thailand, she said.Margins in Thailand were also higher, at 6%, compared with 3% for the UK, she added. ""There will have to be a fairly high asking price for Tesco to be prepared to let it go.""The announcement signals another potential pullback by Tesco from its once-ambitious global expansion.If a sale does go ahead it would mean the company would be left with stores in the UK and Ireland, and its division in central Europe. That unit covers the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.Tesco has been shifting its focus as part of a turnaround programme launched five years ago.The plan was in response to an accounting scandal, and in the face of competition from rival supermarket chains and online competitors.The retail giant has shed several businesses across the world in recent years.Tesco has withdrawn from the US, Japan, and China. In 2015, it sold its South Korean unit for $6.1bn, and a year later offloaded its Kipa business in Turkey, the country's largest supermarket chain.It has also been shedding assets in the UK to focus on its core grocery business. In 2016, it sold the Giraffe restaurant chain just three years after buying it for £49m.In October this year, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis surprised investors by saying he would stand down ""in the summer of 2020"".He took over the top job at the company in 2014, shortly before it was revealed that the retailer had overstated its profits."
'Thomas Cook crash almost ruined my engagement',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50712421,"It could have been a double blow for Corryn Banham and boyfriend Jordon Parkinson. He planned a surprise proposal to Corryn, 24, during a holiday to Crete, but this had to be abandoned after Thomas Cook collapsed in September.Luckily Corryn's mum and dad, who were in on the plan, stepped in to pay for a holiday to Majorca and Jordon, 27, was able to pop the question. ""It could have ruined everything,"" said Corryn, a sales assistant who lives in Stroud, Kent.Now they want to repay the hundreds of pounds back to Corryn's parents, but face more months of delay until the refund is processed. ""We couldn't afford another holiday, but my parents said we could pay them back when our refund arrives,"" she said.Like thousands of other disappointed Thomas Cook customers, she registered for a refund on 7 October, the first day the process opened. Travel regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) - which has vowed to refund all Atol-protected payments - had told those customers to expect their money within 60 days.But last week the CAA warned thousands of customers that payment would be delayed while further details are collected - and Corryn and Jordon are among them.She said: ""I was contacted on the 59th day after submitting my claim, advising that because our package flights were with EasyJet, I have to declare either: 1) I have no plans to fly on my future flights (even though our holiday was 2 October), or 2) I did not fly on my past flight.""They've sent us two identical forms. I emailed the claims company asking for the correct form and they've got back to say it takes 60 working days for a response to an email.""So by the time I get a response, fill the correct form out, and send it back. We're looking at nine months total time for my refund to be correctly processed. ""This is disgusting. I am stressed, having panic attacks, and now my parents have been left short before Christmas when we should have received our refund.""On Monday, the CAA said about 40,000 customers owed money had been paid within the 60-day period, but that some 27,000 faced delay.Last week CAA boss Richard Moriarty thanked consumers for their patience, saying the regulator was working through ""the UK travel industry's largest ever refunds programme"". He added that the refunds operation had been challenging due to the potential for fraudulent claims.""I appreciate that this is a concerning time for Thomas Cook customers who are waiting for their refunds, particularly at this time of the year,"" Mr Moriarty said. While the CAA said it had paid all first-day claims not requiring extra verification, some told the BBC they had still not received their money on Monday.Billy Latham said: ""I contacted the CAA on Saturday and was told my money was paid on Friday and if it did not hit my bank account on Monday to call back.""Well Monday is here and no payments whatsoever, no one at the CAA is picking up the phones and even putting an answer message on stating they are too busy to speak with me due to high call volumes.  ""The only question on my lips and the thousands of others with valid claims is 'when will we get our money back?'""Some 300,000 Thomas Cook claims have been received so far, 215,000 of which have been confirmed as valid. However, this figure includes about 90,000 direct debit customers in October whose money was automatically returned.The CAA says about 40,000 of the cancelled holidays eligible for a refund have still not been claimed for. Customers have until September next year to submit the online form.Thomas Cook collapsed on 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks. Some 150,000 travellers had to be repatriated back to the UK during a two-week operation run by the CAA."
Former US Fed chief Paul Volcker dies aged 92,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50718626,"Paul Volcker, the former head of the US central bank who was known for fighting inflation, has died at the age of 92.Appointed chair of the Federal Reserve in 1979, Mr Volcker dramatically raised interest rates to combat inflation.The move drove the US into recession, but was credited with creating the conditions for long-term growth. It also helped to burnish the bank's reputation for independence.Mr Volcker's tenure at the top of the Fed ended in 1987. More recently he had advised former US President Barack Obama on bank regulation following the financial crisis, overseen the return of money to Holocaust victims, and investigated a United Nations oil-for-food programme.""His life exemplified the highest ideals - integrity, courage, and a commitment to do what was best for all Americans,"" current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement.A legendary figure in American finance, Mr Volcker was known for his penchant for cheap cigars as well as his towering height, given that he was six feet eight inches tall.He also had a reputation for delivering blunt truths. In order to reduce inflation, he warned the US Congress: ""The standard of living of the average American has to decline. I don't think you can escape that."" In a 2018 interview with the New York Times, he said he saw a ""hell of a mess in every direction"" due to the loss of respect for institutions like the Supreme Court, presidency and Federal Reserve.""I don't know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?"" he said.Born in 1927 in New Jersey, Mr Volcker was educated at Princeton, Harvard and the London School of Economics. He served as an undersecretary at the Treasury Department during the Nixon administration and then president of the New York branch of the Fed, before former President Jimmy Carter appointed him Fed chair.During his tenure, the Fed raised interest rates to more than 20% in 1981 - an increase Mr Volcker insisted was necessary to bring an end to the rapid inflation then plaguing the US.The move was credited with ending the inflationary cycle, by changing the public's expectations. As fears of rapid inflation waned, so did rapid spending and demands for pay increases - which had contributed to price increases.Economic activity also dried up due to the sharp rise in borrowing costs, with Mr Volcker bearing the brunt of the blame. After that shock, however, Mr Volcker reduced rates again, to less than 3%.Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Mr Volcker was an ""inspiration"".""The integrity and independence he showed in his battle against inflation helped lead the United States - and with it, the world - through some of the most testing times of the modern era,"" he said.Decades later, as advisor to Mr Obama, Mr Volcker crafted the so-called ""Volcker Rule"" which aimed to reduce risky behaviour at federally-insured banks, banning them from using their own funds to invest in risky assets.Mr Obama said: ""Because of Paul, our financial system is stronger, safer, and more accountable to those who matter most—the American people."" Mr Volcker had reportedly been suffering from prostate cancer. His survivors include two children and his wife, Anke Dening. His first wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1954, died in 1998."
FBI warns FaceApp poses 'potential threat',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50639443,"The FBI said FaceApp and other mobile applications developed in Russia pose a ""potential counterintelligence threat"".The comments were made in a letter to US Senator Chuck Schumer after he called for an investigation into the app.The face-editing tool went viral earlier this year but prompted privacy concerns.The FBI comments come amid rising US concern that products made by foreign tech firms could pose security risks.In a letter addressed to Mr Schumer, the agency said ""it considers any mobile application or similar product developed in Russia, such as FaceApp, to be a potential counterintelligence threat"". The FBI also said it would act if it found any evidence of foreign political meddling through the  application, which alters users' photos to make them look older or younger.FaceApp did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The app was developed by Wireless Lab, a company based in St Petersburg. The company previously said it does not permanently store images, and does not collect troves of data - only uploading specific photos selected by users for editing.Senate minority leader Mr Schumer called for an investigation into FaceApp in July over concerns it could pose ""national security and privacy risks for millions of US citizens"". It comes amid wider scrutiny of foreign technology products in the US. Recently, lawmakers have taken aim at TikTok, a video-sharing platform owned by China's ByteDance.The platform, thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide, has exploded in popularity in recent years.That surge in popularity has caused concern in Western markets due to the nature of its Chinese ownership.US lawmakers, including Mr Schumer, in October requested that ""the intelligence community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-owned content platforms in the US"".

Bug busters: The tech behind new vaccines,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49974477,"""Infectious diseases are evolving much faster than we are, and much faster than our defences are.""I think it's profoundly naive to think we have a handle on them,"" says Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).His organisation was set up after the Ebola epidemic of 2014, when a vaccine was developed, but too late to have any impact on the outbreak.With more than $750m (£571m) from governments and organisations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it is funding promising new vaccine technologies.In particular, CEPI wants vaccines that can be produced quickly. ""In most circumstances that we have an epidemic, speed becomes really, really important,"" Mr Hatchett says.Traditionally, vaccines are made by taking the original virus or bacteria and disabling it in some way.The idea is to degrade the microbe so that it is no longer a health threat, but can still trigger a response from immune system. The body can then use that immune response if it ever comes into contact with the real infection.That kind of approach has been terrifically successful, saving millions of lives. The trouble is that developing and manufacturing vaccines that way is slow and expensive.Frederic Garzoni is one of many scientists hoping to change all that.He spent years in France working on proteins, examining and tweaking the building blocks of bodies.But in 2016 he came across something he thinks is very special.  A protein structure that self-assembles into a football-like molecule, that can be easily manipulated and be produced in large quantities, and can perhaps be used to vaccinate against a host of diseases.More Technology of Business""I thought that is the best protein I have seen in 15 years. I'm quitting my job and I'm going to focus on this,"" he said.Mr Garzoni, and others, are manipulating all sorts of microbes, often at the level of DNA, to make particles that spur the immune system into action.His research has been helped by powerful tools, including cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a procedure that lowers samples to extremely low temperatures and then bombards then with electrons.The resulting pictures render almost atomic detail, allowing scientists to identify useful properties, that would have been unknown before cryo-EM came along.At the University of Bristol, those images have been combined with powerful cloud-computing services provided by US tech giant Oracle, which allow detailed pictures to be created more quickly and cheaply than ever before.With that kind of detail, researchers can identify all sorts of useful properties.There are dozens of different research groups developing new technologies to create vaccines in different ways.Jon Cuccui is an associate professor of microbiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.His research has focused on vaccines to tackle bacterial infections. The approach has been to use a safe strain of the escherichia ecoli bacterium as a molecular factory to produce a sugar-protein complex, that can train the host to recognise many dangerous infections.""You end up with an infinite quantity of vaccine, that is scaleable... and therefore much cheaper to produce,"" he said.Several vaccines produced using this technology are already in clinical trials.Mr Cuccui says the ability to quickly determine the genetic blueprint of an organism and then tweak that blueprint has made a big difference to his research.""We can go and target an organism and develop a prototype vaccine at a much faster rate than we could 10 to 20 years ago.""Once scientists have developed a promising vaccine, they conduct pre-clinical trials on mice and larger animals. That stage alone can take years of research. But if the treatment is promising then it will be tested on humans.Being able to develop and manufacture vaccines more cheaply is the goal of Mr Hatchett's organisation, CEPI.""We don't want to just develop high-price vaccines that can only be afforded by the one percenters in the developed world... the epidemic diseases we are focused on are much more likely to emerge in lower and middle-income countries,"" he says.Giant pharmaceutical companies are some of the most important operators in the vaccine business.GSK is one of the biggest players in the field, making vaccines that protect against 21 diseases.""This is a new golden age of vaccines as far as I'm concerned,"" says William ""Rip"" Ballou, head of US vaccine research at pharmaceuticals giant GSK.He is particularly excited about a technology, called self-amplifying mRNA (SAM), which starts with part of the genetic code of a virus, converting that into messenger RNA (molecules which carry instructions for the body about how to build proteins).Once injected into the body, the molecule can use the body's own systems to trigger an immune response to the original virus.Potentially it allows GSK to find candidate vaccines more quickly, which could be vital when responding to an outbreak. It could also revolutionise the way vaccines are manufactured. At the moment each vaccine has its own dedicated production line, but SAM could see the same equipment used to make different vaccines - which would be much cheaper and faster.""This is really mind blowing technology,"" says Mr Ballou.

'I would sell a kidney for the Baby Yoda toy',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50656178,"""I want a Baby Yoda toy so badly that I'd consider selling a kidney,"" jokes Star Wars fan and Instagram influencer Jessica Allsop, 26. Ms Allsopp, from Rubery, West Midlands, fell in love with the character of ""the Child"" - affectionately known as ""Baby Yoda"" on social media - in the Disney+ TV show The Mandalorian as soon as she watched the first episode. She then scoured the internet looking for merchandise from the Star Wars spin-off series, and says she is willing to pay up to £200 for an accurate replica of the Child.She's not alone. Since The Mandalorian was released on 12 November in the US on Disney's new streaming service, the character has gone viral, and not just in America - the only place you can officially watch the show for now - but all over the world. It has generated thousands of memes as fans exclaim over how cute the Child is and theorise about what will happen next in the series.Yet, to the surprise of many, Disney has been slow to offer merchandise relating to the Mandalorian, waiting until this week - a month after the show's launch - to unveil its range of vinyl and plush Child toys.Even worse, the figures will not be available until next May or June, failing to meet the frenzy of demand over the crucial Christmas shopping period. That's not stopped people pre-ordering the toys in droves. UK film and entertainment merchandiser Zavvi, which began selling the figures on Wednesday, says the Child is already one of its fastest-selling products with ""hundreds"" being snapped up in the first hour.According to Richard Gottlieb, head of toy industry consultancy Global Toy Experts, Disney's decision to keep the Child a secret will have a big impact on the toy industry.""It's a shame. On the consumer product side, it's an enormous amount of lost revenue for Disney, the licensees and the retailers, and a lot of lost excitement,"" he says.Typically it takes about nine months for a toy inspired by a film or TV show to be realised, from the inception of the idea until it hits the shelves. And it can take up to 15 months if the toy is being prepared for a Christmas release.In order to bring out a new toy product, licensing agreements need to be agreed, designs need to be approved and engineers need to create injection moulds for making the toys out of plastic at the factories in China. The product then needs to be manufactured and delivered from China to retailers around the world. So there is no way that Disney suddenly woke up to the hype surrounding the Child in November, says Mr Gottlieb. Plans for the toy have been underway since 2018 at least, he says.  John Baulch, publisher of trade magazine Toy World, agrees, saying that delaying the launch was intentional on Disney's part. ""Disney would have known that they had a breakout hit with the Child,"" he says. ""But the Mandalorian's director, Jon Favreau, was quite insistent that he wanted the content of the series to lead, rather than the merchandise. In this instance the director won the argument.""Alexander Westwood, 19, a TV and film actor from Birmingham, thinks Disney may also have been trying to avoid toys becoming ""spoilers"" for the series.In the UK, people will not be be able to enjoy The Mandalorian officially until the Disney+ streaming service launches in late March 2020. And while some will find workarounds, many others will just have to wait, leaving them at risk of stumbling across plot and character details. ""I kind of completely understand Disney's decision not to market Baby Yoda as a toy until after Disney+ has become available in more countries,"" Mr Westwood tells the BBC.  ""A lot of toy companies nowadays like Lego's Marvel range spoil potential scenes and possibilities, so to me it makes sense.""Mr Gottlieb agrees, saying that Disney's decision means Star Wars fans will get a genuine surprise for once, in an age where leaked product photos often spoil shows months before they come out.""It's amazing that in this day and age that they were able to keep this a secret,"" he says. ""Their intent was not only to incite excitement in the Mandalorian, but really in the whole Disney+ launch, and it did create a conversation.""He says this situation shows that different industries are no longer in their own silos. Toys, entertainment, intellectual property and video streaming all have the power to affect each other, and that is likely to have a big impact on the toy industry in the future.  ""Was it a good decision or a bad one on Disney's part? We'll have to wait until June 2020 to see, but it's a disappointment that there's going to be a lot of money left on the table."""
US jobs growth jumps in November,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50690745,"The US economy added the largest number of jobs for 10 months in November, confounding economists' expectations of a slowdown.Official data showed employers added 266,000 jobs last month, while the jobless rate dipped to 3.5% from 3.6%.The growth was helped by striking GM workers returning to work and a big rise in healthcare posts.The US economy has continued to expand, despite concerns that trade wars had hit business confidence and investment.Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said the latest jobs data had ""surpassed expectations"".""The upbeat data reinforces the strength of both the labour market and consumer confidence, despite slowing global growth and continued trade uncertainty.""Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed wide-ranging gains, even in indicators that were slow to revive after the financial crisis.For example, the number of people working part-time, despite wanting full-time positions, dropped to 4.32 million - well below the 30-year average. Wage growth, while still modest, also ticked up, rising 3.1% year-on-year.The White House welcomed the gains, which officials said proved President Donald Trump's economic policies were working.""Great jobs report!"" Mr Trump tweeted. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jobs numbers were ""astonishing"", but could be revised down at some point.The 266,000 rise was ""well above"" the analyst consensus of 180,000, and considering returning GM workers were part of a net gain of 41,000 in the motor industry, the numbers were ""hugely strong"", he said.""This is wild,"" he said. ""That [jump is] hard to square with leading indicators, all of which tanked in the late summer and early fall, so it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision.""The US economy, which is powered largely by consumer spending, grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the three months to 30 September, according to the latest government estimate.But business investment and confidence have slumped, amid concerns about trade fights and global growth. The rate of hiring has also retreated, dipping from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018 to 180,000 per month this year.To address fears of a slowdown, the US central bank has lowered interest rates three times since July.The strength of the latest hiring report suggests the Federal Reserve will leave rates untouched for now, analysts said."
'I slept in a cupboard for three months',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50644235,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Mathias Mikkelsen, founder of Norwegian tech company Memory.Mathias Mikkelsen was so keen to get his business up and running that he slept in a cupboard for three months.Back in late 2013, the then 23-year-old entrepreneur had moved on his own from Norway to Silicon Valley in California, to try to secure backing for his start-up idea - an online project and time management tool called Timely.There was just one big problem for the Norwegian - he didn't know a single person in the wider San Francisco Bay Area.""At the time there wasn't really a tech start-up scene in Norway, so I decided that moving to Silicon Valley - the tech capital of the world - would be the best thing for me to do,"" says Mathias.""But I didn't know anyone at all out there. So when I landed human instinct kicked in, and the first thing I knew I needed to do was make friends. Then I realised that most people make friends via work or at college, and I wasn't going to be joining a workplace or going to be a student.""So faced with the prospect of getting very lonely very quickly, Mathias devised a cunning plan.""I decided that I would hire rooms in shared Airbnb houses, and move somewhere new every week,"" he says. ""That way, law of averages, I would start to make friends.""Thankfully for Mathias his idea worked, and over the following months he slowly built up a circle of mates. But his next challenge - the holy grail - was to get himself into a ""hacker house"".A hacker house is a property shared by a number of similar young tech entrepreneurs, who are all trying to get their business proposals off the ground. The idea is that everyone can help each other and share advice, inspiration and contacts.In mid-2014 he was finally able to get himself into such a property in Silicon Valley, but there was a catch - all 15 of the proper beds were taken. So if he wanted in, he would have to sleep on an airbed in a windowless cupboard.Mathias, now 29, says he jumped at the chance. ""I slept in that cupboard for three months. Did I feel stupid or embarrassed? Not at all.""Being in the hacker house was invaluable. It pushed me so much as an entrepreneur. It was extremely valuable and without it I don't think I would be where I am today.""Fast forward to the present day, and Mathias' Timely app is now used by more than 5,000 companies across 160 countries.Born in the far north of Norway, Mathias was raised in a town just outside the capital Oslo.As a child he says that his initial dream was to become a professional football player, specifically for the English team Manchester United, but then as a teenager he discovered that he was much better at computer programming.While still at secondary school he started to get paid to design websites for companies on a freelance basis. Mathias says his parents were initially not happy about this, ""until I got my first paycheque"".More The Boss features:Leaving school at 18, he then worked for a number of digital design companies in Oslo, where his work including making the in-flight entertainment system for airline Norwegian Air, and a Facebook campaign for charity Unicef.But wanting to be his own boss, and wishing to develop his own business idea, he started work on Timely. Mathias launched its first iteration in May 2013 while still living in Oslo, but ""nothing happened"".""I got some likes on Facebook, and some thumbs up from friends, but no real customers signing up,"" he says. ""It went completely to hell. I'd put my all into it, night after night, then it launched and all I could hear was the sound of crickets. It was devastating, it takes the breath out of you.""With his savings running low, Mathias says he realised he ""only had one more shot"" at making Timely a success. So it was time to place a big bet - he sold his apartment in Oslo to raise more funds, and moved to Silicon Valley.After his time in the hacker house, and working with a fellow programmer in India, Mathias launched the second iteration of Timely at the end of 2014. Sales to businesses - who pay a subscription then slowly started to grow. A year later, Mathias decided to move the business - which he called Memory - back to Oslo. ""While there was no tech start-up scene in the city when I left, it has subsequently boomed. Oslo is now a great place to find tech staff.""Backed by $6m (£4.6m) of funding from investment firms in the US, UK and Norway, Memory now employs 45 people, and has annual sales of more than $2m.Entrepreneurs like Mathias ""tend to have certain innate characteristics when compared with the general population"", says Brian Morgan, professor of entrepreneur at Cardiff Metropolitan University. ""This means that they are more likely to take risks and grasp opportunities.""In the early years of product development it's always about resilience - the ability to keep going when the outlook looks bleak - and also self-reliance - the capacity to be resourceful and confident enough to depend only on yourself.""Renting a cupboard in Silicon Valley to help get a start-up business to first base would seem to me to be a perfect example of the persistence and passion needed to become a successful entrepreneur.""Looking back on his three months living in a cupboard, Mathias says it was ""a crazy time, but super cool"". He adds: ""I was working every minute of every day, so I honestly didn't care where I was sleeping."""
Trump warns of another year of trade tension,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50649825,"US President Donald Trump has set off a new bout of trade worries, firing tariff threats and hinting that a China deal may not happen for another year.Speaking at a Nato summit on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he had ""no deadline"" for striking an agreement with Beijing.The remarks suggested another round of China tariffs - due 15 December -  might become reality, sending US shares to their largest losses in weeks.It comes amid fresh trade disputes with France, Brazil and Argentina.For more than a year the US and China have been locked in a bitter trade battle that has seen both sides impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each another's goods.But while the uncertainty has dampened economic growth in the US and abroad, Mr Trump - a self-declared ""Tariff Man"" - has appeared content to let the spat roll on, despite the odd hint he might compromise. ""It creates chaos and instability and he thrives on that in some ways,"" said Jennifer Hillman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former US trade official.""The question being raised is, 'are we really trying to get to a solution with China or is this really all about raising tariffs?'""Investors were cheered when Mr Trump seemed to drop a plan to hit European cars and car parts with import duties earlier this month. There were also hopes that the US and China might strike a limited ""phase one"" deal to avert the 15 December round of tariffs, which will affect a wide range of consumer goods, including Apple products, clothing and Christmas lights.But on Tuesday the president said he liked the idea of ""waiting until after the election"" to make a pact with Beijing, adding: ""We'll see whether or not there's a deal. It's got to be right.""The main US indices fell roughly 1% on the remarks, which were echoed by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on broadcaster CNBC.""It's our job to try to get a proper deal done,"" Mr Ross said, though he added there is still a possibility that the president would suspend the looming tariffs.The comments follow a series of other protectionist moves by the president this week. On Monday, Mr Trump made a surprise announcement on Twitter that he would restore tariffs on Brazilian and Argentine steel and aluminium. The office of the US Trade Representative on Monday also said it might increase the tariff rates on $7.5bn worth of European goods, already planned as punishment for Airbus subsidies.And it announced it was readying higher import taxes on roughly $2.4bn worth of French goods, including Champagne and Roquefort cheese, in retaliation for a digital services tax.  Mr Trump's trade actions - some of which raise legal questions - ensure he remains the centre of attention, while diverting talk from more pressing political problems, Ms Hillman said. The president is currently facing impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives over claims he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020.""I think he thinks it makes him look tough, it makes him look unconventional and it focuses all the attention on his actions,"" she said.Whether Mr Trump's strategy will win politically remains to be seen.Mr Trump's concerns about China are widely held in Washington, providing little political incentive for him to back down. And while the fights have hit farmers - a key constituency for Mr Trump - polls suggest their support remains resilient.Michelle Erickson-Jones is a fourth-generation wheat farmer from Montana, who is working with Farmers for Free Trade, a lobby group that opposes tariffs. She said farmers are aware of the monumental changes the Trump administration is trying to achieve with China and are focused instead on trying to secure other deals, like the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which the three countries completed last year but has yet to pass Congress.""While we don't have time or much more patience with China, it's just the reality of what we're looking at,"" she said."
Johnson backs tech tax despite Trump's threats,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50656106,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would press ahead with a digital sales tax even after the US threatened to punish France for a similar move.In a proposal first outlined last year, large online companies face a tax of 2% of UK sales from April 2020.Mr Johnson said digital companies needed to make a ""fairer contribution"".Donald Trump has threatened to impose taxes on French goods in retaliation for a digital services tax that would affect Google, Amazon and Facebook. Ahead of Wednesday's Nato meeting in Watford, the US President said: ""We've taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled.""We'd rather not do that, but that's the way it would work. So it's either going to work out, or we'll work out some mutually beneficial tax.""The US said it would apply tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4bn (£1.8bn) of cheese, Champagne, handbags and other French products. The US has made clear that other countries pursuing a digital sales tax could face similar action.Multinational companies including Google and Facebook have been criticised for paying very little tax in some countries despite booking large revenues due to the way profits can be reported in lower tax jurisdictions.A multilateral solution is being sought but some countries, including the UK, are introducing interim taxes.""On the digital services tax, I do think we need to look at the operation of the big digital companies and the huge revenues they have in this country and the amount of tax that they pay,"" Mr Johnson said late on Tuesday. ""We need to sort that out. They need to make a fairer contribution.""The UK's tax was first suggested by Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and could initially raise almost £500m a year. The pledge to implement the tax is contained in the Conservative manifesto.The Labour Party has also promised a tax on ""multinationals"".  In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically.France is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than €750m ($850m; £670m), of which at least €25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about €400m this year."
How China-US rivalry is dividing the internet,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50570838,"When Hyunjin Seo visited Beijing in July last year, she scrolled through Google News on her smartphone and discovered several reports about an attack on the city's US embassy.An associate professor at the University of Kansas's journalism department, she bypassed China's strict digital media censors thanks to the roaming plan of her US phone firm. This allowed her to access websites such as those from Google not available in China.""I was telling my Chinese friends about the bomb detonating outside the [US] embassy and they didn't know what I was talking about, because this news wasn't appearing in their search feeds,"" recalls Prof Seo, who teaches courses on digital media. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Her experience is common for any westerner visiting China. The internet in the world's most populous country is heavily restricted and censored, leading experts to speculate that in the future there could be two distinct internets - one led by China and one by the US.The point was made last year by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.At a private event, when an economist asked Mr Schmidt (now a board member of Google parent company Alphabet) about the potential of the internet fragmenting into different sub-internets with different regulations, he replied, ""I think the most likely scenario now is not a splintering, but rather a bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.""Such a divide is already in place, due to the Great Firewall of China, a government-sponsored programme that censors content within its digital borders. Chinese users can't access Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox or Pinterest, among other popular sites.They also can't read online information on the Tiananmen Square massacre or criticism aimed at President Xi Jinping. Even online images of Winnie the Pooh have been banned in China after protesters compared President Xi's face to the classic Disney character.""In one of the biggest markets in the world, tech companies are leaving because they can't fully operate how they want to, by freely sharing information online,"" notes Ms Seo. Such censorship means overseas businesses are hampered if they want to expand into China - one of the most attractive markets in the world. More Technology of BusinessNo matter the size of the company, to operate in China overseas firms have to jump through hoops that can cause them problems.While Apple services and products are available in China, the California-based tech giant has sparked controversy over its activities in the Chinese market. In 2017, China asked Apple to remove the New York Times and Skype app from its App Store. Apple complied. Google has also waded into Chinese waters, only to be met with intense criticism. Most notably, Google secretly worked on a version of its search engine to go up against Chinese-born Baidu. The Chinese-only Google would censor some results relating to human rights violations and controversial laws. ""Project Dragonfly"" was uncovered in a 2018 article by The Intercept, and Google eventually scrapped the project.""When you enter search terms in China on their search engine, you get a different result from what you see in the West,"" says Sarah Cook, senior China research analyst at Freedom House, a US independent watchdog focusing on human rights. ""The red lines of what is being censored are constantly moving.""2019 marks the fourth year in a row that Freedom House has ranked China at the bottom for Internet freedom in its annual report ""Freedom on the Net"".A business looking to enter China has to either play by the rules or leave. For example, LinkedIn doesn't allow Chinese users to access politically sensitive profiles or posts from people outside the country. Why such restrictions on a tool specifically designed to open up digital realms of information, media and debate?""That censorship relates to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and promoting an official narrative about the nation-state,"" says Renren Yang, an assistant professor of modern Chinese popular culture at the University of British Columbia. While Chinese internet users can't use Google and WhatsApp, they have Chinese equivalents, Baidu and WeChat.Meanwhile, Amazon shut down its online store in China earlier this year in the face of poor sales trying to compete against Alibaba.Isn't China already crafting its own parallel internet?""An isolated Chinese internet is cut off from the rest of the world,"" says Ms Cook. ""And what is worrying is that other countries are copying what China is doing by blocking access to certain sites or slowing down net service during protests or rallies.""Prof Yang says it would only benefit China to usher in more Western companies seeking to bring its services to the country. ""For example, competition with Chinese local telecom companies will spawn the invention of new technologies and new services that people can afford and utilize. Competition brings forth innovation.""Prof Seo isn't optimistic China will change its online tune anytime soon. ""Since China has replaced Western media with their own apps and sites, they don't really need western tech companies.""Other experts are hopeful that a splintering of the Internet won't be permanent.Prof Yang says: ""One day, I'd like to see the Great Firewall come down, just like the Berlin Wall did."""
Thomas Cook: 'They told me the money was safe',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50684434,"Customers of collapsed tour operator Thomas Cook have been getting in touch with the BBC to voice their frustration at delays in processing their refunds for holidays that never took place.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) originally said all valid claims made on the first day of its refund programme would be paid within 60 days, or by Friday 6 December. But now it says only two-thirds will be paid on time.Retired teachers Alan and Diane Holmes from Ripon in north Yorkshire booked a two-week holiday in Egypt, but initially thought their money was safe because the booking was made through another firm, Freedom Holidays. ""My wife always wanted to do the Egypt Nile cruise. It's been quite peaceful there these last two years, so we thought we'd best do it before it all takes off again,"" Mr Holmes told the BBC, referring to the possibility of civil unrest in the country.But as they later found out, the cruise itself and the hotel accommodation had been booked through Thomas Cook.The couple had paid £3,200 for the holiday, but were then told they would have to pay another £2,200 upfront if they wanted the holiday to go ahead.""They had told me the money was safe in a trust fund, but it turned out that Thomas Cook had already taken it,"" said Mr Holmes.They decided to cancel and are now waiting for the initial £3,200 to be refunded. ""I filled in the CAA form and never heard anything back,"" said Mr Holmes. ""Then two days ago, I got this email saying they wanted more information.""Mr Holmes has now provided details of the booking and the credit card payment. ""I realise the people dealing with it have got a lot of work to go through. It's just the poor communication,"" he said.""Travel companies are very happy to take your money, then as soon as anything goes wrong, they don't want to know.""Bank employee Deborah Hulme and her husband Stephen, from Staffordshire, paid Thomas Cook £3,060 for ""the holiday of a lifetime"".They planned to spend a week in New York and a further two in Las Vegas.As well as the package holiday itself, they had booked excursions and other extras with third-party companies, which made things extremely complicated.""When they went bust, we were in turmoil,"" Ms Hulme told the BBC. ""We would have had to cancel every single thing. It was a complete nightmare to even start doing.""As a result, they decided to pay out another £3,500 to re-book the same holiday with another travel agent, expecting to be reimbursed promptly by Thomas Cook. But they too are still waiting.""We had no choice but to replace our holiday, because we would have lost so much otherwise,"" said Ms Hulme. ""We thought we would get it back pretty much straight away.""Maggie Eveleigh of Highbridge in Somerset, who works at Asda, booked a £3,500 10-day all-inclusive holiday in Turkey for herself, her partner Terence Beasley and his son and grandson.When Thomas Cook collapsed, she booked another holiday in Cyprus at a cost of £3,800.What annoys her most is that two days before the firm went under, when the extent of its problems had started to come to light, she spent another £50 to secure a late check-out at the Turkish hotel and the payment was processed the same day.""I asked if there were problems and I was told it was just scaremongering,"" she told the BBC.Now she is anxiously waiting to be reimbursed. ""I can't afford to lose that money,"" she said. ""Christmas is looming and I'm still £3,500 out of pocket.""But not everyone has had the same bad experience. Vape shop salesman Jason Henderson, from Lancaster, booked a Thomas Cook package holiday to Cuba and paid for it in instalments on direct debit. As the news emerged that the company was in trouble, he continued to check with his local branch and was told that nothing had changed.""Then I woke up on 23 September and boom, everything was gone,"" he told the BBC.Fortunately, he was able to borrow money to book another Cuban holiday with a different firm.""I ended up having to go via Amsterdam and staying in a different hotel at the other end of the island,"" he said.In the end, his final direct debit payment didn't go through, because the bank stopped it when Thomas Cook collapsed. But after he put in his claim for a refund, he received five separate instalments of £109.56 back within two weeks, while his initial deposit of £700 was refunded on Thursday, just before the deadline.""I had no problems with them. The communication with them was great,"" he said.""But Thomas Cook hadn't provided the correct information for a lot of people, and that's why some people are having so many problems."""
The garlic farmers who love Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50458312,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief""."
Most-viewed mansions of 2019 revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50726762,"More than a quarter of those clicking on property websites have no intention to buy. No wonder they end up looking at the most striking homes available.A castle, a multi-million pound penthouse, and an audacious mirrored bedroom ceiling are among the most-viewed, according to Rightmove.The properties include a boathouse, private cinemas, and a replica Angel of the North - in Essex.In contrast, the UK housing market has been relatively undramatic this year.Relatively few homes have been put up for sale owing to political uncertainty and worries about the economy.It might not be to everyone's taste but the master bedroom in one mansion in Chigwell, Essex, features a huge mirror above the bed. It also has a replica, but smaller, Angel of the North sculpture outside.""Suffice to say the properties with the biggest personalities or quirkiest features are usually the most popular,"" said Miles Shipside, of Rightmove.A survey of 6,000 people by rival property portal, Zoopla, earlier this year suggested that 27% of people had no intention to buy or sell.

'It's inexcusable we don't know who we can hire',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50712497,"A business group has said it is ""inexcusable"" that firms do not know who they would be able to hire this time next year under Conservative plans for a points-based immigration system.The British Chambers of Commerce has demanded clarity on how the proposed points-based system would work.The head of the BCC said farmers were already leaving fruit to rot in fields because of difficulties hiring workers.The Conservative Party says the proposed system is ""fairer"".Over the weekend, the party said a Conservative government would introduce a new system to sort migrant workers into three categories after Brexit.Entrepreneurs, investors and people who have won awards in certain fields would receive fast-track entry under the system.Meanwhile, skilled workers - such as doctors, nurses and other health professionals - who have a confirmed job offer would be placed in another category, with those eligible for an NHS visa also receiving fast-track entry and reduced fees.For low- or un-skilled workers, sector-specific rules would be put in place to fill gaps where UK workers cannot be found.But business groups fear that the plans would leave hiring decisions in the hands of bureaucrats rather than firms.""What we really do need to see is an immigration system that offers businesses clarity and simplicity,"" BCC director general Adam Marshall told the BBC's Today programme.He stressed that it was important for businesses to understand details of how that system would work.""Simply saying you're going to have an Australian-style, points-based system - without giving businesses a route map for what that means for them - is not good enough, frankly,"" Mr Marshall said.Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""While a points-based system sounds attractive, we need a system for the UK and our four nations, not for Australia.""Further, he said ""arbitrary"" assessments of when and where low-skilled workers are needed would be costly.Matthew Fell from the CBI business lobby group said the plans focused too heavily on bringing in workers who are the ""brightest and the best"".""As important as attracting high-skilled workers is, low-level skills are still very much in demand for business.""He said that industries ranging from hospitality and construction to agriculture and the care sector depended on low-skilled workers.""Workers needed to boost economic growth must feel welcome in the UK,"" Mr Fell said. ""Until there is more detail, these plans will leave them nervous.""But Rishi Sunak, the Conservative Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the system would mean visas were processed much more quickly than they are at present.""We want an immigration system that is responsive to the needs of our economy and society and actually responsive to what business wants,"" he told the Today programme.Over the weekend, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Tories would create a ""fairer system"" which would attract the ""brightest and the best from around the world"" while getting immigration down.She said: ""The vote to leave the EU was a vote to take back control of our borders, and that is exactly what a Conservative majority government will do by getting Brexit done and ending freedom of movement."""
What Trump wants from trade,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50465651,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. "
'We try to make good food emotionally addictive',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50557696,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to John Vincent, chief executive and co-founder of fast food chain Leon.John Vincent admits he was ""just mad"" for fast food in his youth.""I remember, vividly, lying on my back when I was eight, waving my hands and feet in the air with delight, when my parents told me that for my birthday we were going to McDonald's,"" says the 48-year old.That was the start of a long love affair with fast food that ultimately sparked the creation of Leon in 2004 when he was 33.He recalls that by his early 30s he was still ""eating a heck a lot of fast food... sometimes two or three meals every day"", when he had the idea that quick service meals did not have to be unhealthy.The result was Leon - named after his father - and launched with friends Henry Dimbleby and Allegra McEvedy.""If we could make good food as emotionally addictive as traditional fast food, which was good for you and kind to the planet, I thought it could be a fun business to run,"" says John.From its first store in central London's Carnaby Street, Leon now has more than 70 restaurants across the UK and Europe, three so far in the US, and a workforce of more than 2,000.Growing up in North London, the ethos of hard work was instilled in John early. His father's family were Italian immigrants, and his grandfather (who had changed the family name from Febraro to Vincent during World War Two) was a serial entrepreneur with multiple start-up ideas that often came to nothing.""I had a desire in me to say, 'don't worry granddad, I can do those things that you tried to do',"" says John.  ""[And] I was absolutely programmed with the stories of how my grandma had to leave school at 15.""I was told every day not to let that happen to me... and that no one's going to help you out if you don't try hard.""That hard work paid off. After going to school, John read history at Cambridge University - where he embarked on his first business venture, a production company doing music events.""We'd be on the road a lot, and I just couldn't pass a McDonalds,"" he says. ""Every time I'd try to drive past, I'd end up stopping and going in to get loads of fast food for the crew in the van.""After university, John spent four years working in sales and marketing at consumer goods giant Proctor & Gamble, before seven years at management consultancy firm Bain. It was while working there that he came up with the idea for Leon with his colleague Henry, son of veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby.Henry brought in Allegra, a professional chef and school friend of his sister's, and the three of them set about launching the business. John says their pitch for Leon was ""what if God did fast food?"", or ""what if fast food was in heaven?"".Looking back, John - who is married to the TV presenter Katie Derham - admits that in many ways they had it easy when looking for financial backers, because of the connections he and Henry made during their time at Bain.One of his clients while at the consultancy was the multi-millionaire South African businessman Vivian Imerman, then the boss of whisky business Whyte & Mackay. It was Mr Imerman who put up £500,000 to help launch Leon.""I had done a project for them, and they liked what I'd done,"" says John. ""And although they didn't really get the concept of healthy fast food, they decided to give us the money.""For the first few years of Leon, John combined helping to run the company with taking up the director of marketing role at Whyte and Mackay. He eventually became chief executive of Leon in 2014. Today Henry remains on the board, while Allegra is still a shareholder.John says that over the years his leadership style has mellowed. Out has gone his military, command-and-control approach, and in has come a more nurturing attitude.More The Boss features:He credits taking up the Chinese martial art of Wing Tsun, which literally translates as ""beautiful springtime"", for the overhaul. ""I thought I was a good leader, but I was told I was leading like a general,"" he says.The guiding principle of Wing Tsun, he says, is built on ""winning not fighting"", or winning by staying relaxed and flexible.  When applied to the world of business, John says that it means leadership should not be ""about confrontation"". Instead he says it is about making sure ""everyone is moving in the same direction for the right reason"". Staff at Leon are encouraged to give Wing Tsun a try.Leon's sales are certainly moving in the right direction. At a time when restaurant chains are closing down, its revenues for the 2018 financial year were up 25%. The company did not, however, make a profit, as it instead put funds into its continuing expansion. It is particularly targeting the US, where it has hired a former Burger King chief executive to lead that drive.While McDonald's may have been John's inspiration, Leon is not a traditional fast food joint, according to Trish Caddy, senior food service analyst at market research company Mintel. She says it instead occupies a ""blurred middle ground between traditional fast food in the UK, and what we consider casual dining"".In the US it would be known as ""casual fast dining"" - higher quality food, without table service.Ms Caddy adds that Leon's ""uniqueness is being at the cutting-edge of menu innovation that is geared towards the business crowd"".""Leon stands out by focusing on making healthy food and drink more accessible to city-dwellers and commuters throughout the day,"" she says.That concurs with John's vision for Leon in the first place. ""It's got to be with fresh ingredients, with good gut health, with Mediterranean food principles,"" he says. ""And in a place where people smile because they want to smile."" "
Apology over railcards issued with missing photos,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50762453,"National Rail has apologised for ""technical issues"" which meant some railcards were issued with photographs missing. Customers who bought ""Two Together"" railcards online complained that only one person was pictured on them instead of two. Other customers have experienced problems receiving their railcards and getting through to the company.  National Rail says it is working hard to fix the issues. Stephen Drury from Wakefield bought a Two Together railcard through the Railcard website. It allows a third off rail fares for two named people when they travel together and the card is supposed to include both of their photographs.But after downloading the new railcard onto his smartphone, Stephen noticed something important was missing. ""I was quite astounded to find that the Mrs wasn't on it. I was the only person on it. It was quite baffling to be honest. How on earth can it process a Two Together railcard with only one person on? It's ridiculous,"" he said.Mike from Sheffield told Radio 4's You & Yours that a similar thing happened to him. He was worried because he had already bought train tickets to London which he thought would not be valid with a Two Together railcard that did not include a picture of his girlfriend. After failing to get through to the Railcard team on their telephone line, their website or via email, he cancelled his discounted tickets and got a refund. ""I've now had to re-buy them at the increased price just so I have that peace of mind travelling without needing a Railcard. I still haven't had any feedback from the Railcard team at all and I feel a bit stuck,"" he said.  National Rail said the problem with people's photographs has now been solved and they are reissuing these cards where possible. Alternatively, people can get a refund and reorder their card. Other problems with processing some railcard applications online are continuing though.  The company has posted the same message on its websites for different railcards including those for older people, ""Family & Friends"" and those aged 16-25, and has blamed ""website maintenance issues"". The message advises people to buy or renew railcards at ticket offices if they are due to travel soon.  Jane Openshaw from Egremont in Cumbria was worried after her new ""Disabled Persons Railcard"" did not arrive in the post and she could not get through to anyone to chase it up. It was only after the BBC contacted National Rail that her application was processed and sent out by special delivery. National Rail said anyone who has bought a railcard but has yet to receive it can still travel but they need to carry email confirmation of their railcard purchase with them which train staff have been briefed to accept as proof. A National Rail spokesman said: ""We recently carried out planned maintenance of our Railcard website to help improve how people buy and renew their cards. ""While the vast majority of customers are not experiencing problems, some technical issues mean that people making certain types of transaction are encountering problems. We're extremely sorry for the inconvenience this has caused and we are working hard to fix the issues.""We are very keen that nobody is left out of pocket by the problems we are experiencing and if anyone believes this to have been the case they should apply for a refund providing proof of purchase to railcardhelp@nationalrail.co.uk.""

Saudi Aramco raises record $25.6bn in share sale,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50681159,"State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco has raised a record $25.6bn (£19.4bn) in its initial public offering in Riyadh.The share sale was the biggest to date, surpassing that of China's Alibaba which raised $25bn in 2014 in New York. Aramco relied on domestic and regional investors to sell a 1.5% stake after lukewarm interest from abroad. The IPO will value it at $1.7tn when trading begins - short of its $2tn target, but making it the most valuable listed company in the world.The share sale is at the heart of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to modernise the Saudi economy and wean it off its dependence on oil. The country urgently needs tens of billions of dollars to fund megaprojects and develop new industries.Aramco has found the journey to its public offering testing. It initially sought to raise $100bn on two exchanges - with a first listing on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another on an overseas exchange such as the London Stock Exchange. But it scaled back its plans after foreign investors raised concerns about climate change, political risk and a lack of corporate transparency. International institutions also baulked at the firm's $1.7tn valuation, prompting Aramco to pull marketing roadshows in New York and London.Instead, it focused its marketing efforts on Saudi investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies. Saudi banks also offered citizens cheap credit to bid for the shares following a nationwide advertising campaign.  Shares were priced at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53) on Thursday and were heavily oversubscribed, according to reports. But it remains to be seen whether the share price rises or falls when trading begins, most likely later this month. The IPO's pricing came as Saudi Arabia met with Russia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna to discuss oil production.The allies - who together pump 40% of the world's oil - agreed to deepen output cuts as part of ongoing efforts to prop up global prices. Oil prices collapsed in mid 2014 and have yet to fully recover, leaving oil-dependent economies under pressure. The market is struggling with slower global growth and a flood of new production from countries such as the US.Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondentThree years after it was first announced Saudi Arabia is finally taking the world's most profitable company public. The market valuation is less than the $2tn target that Crown Prince Bin-Salman - had initially hoped to achieve. The company has committed to a large annual dividend until 2024 to ensure investors don't sell shares in the near future leading to a drop in market valuation.But analysts believe the biggest challenge for the company will be if it decides to list on an international stock exchange in the future to expand its investor pool. The core business of Saudi Aramco - oil - is considered by many experts its biggest risk. Demand for crude has been falling, which could make it difficult for the company to grow in the long term. The climate crisis and geopolitical risks are also key factors that could deter potential investors."
Aramco jumps in world's biggest ever market debut,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50739193,"Saudi Aramco's stock rose sharply as the world's biggest share listing got underway in Riyadh, rising 10% above the initial public offering price.Last week the oil giant, which produces more than a tenth of global crude supply, raised $25.6bn (£19.5bn).Saudi Arabia's royal family is privatising assets as part of a plan to move the kingdom away from its reliance on oil.The money raised from the sales will be used for non-energy investments.Today's 10% rise, Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange's daily limit, gives Aramco a market valuation of around $1.88tn.That easily makes it the world's most valuable listed company but still less than the $2tn targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.However it is still the biggest share sale to date, surpassing that of China's Alibaba, which raised $25bn in 2014 in New York.It came after a testing journey for Aramco's public offering.Saudi Arabia had to rely on domestic and regional investors to sell the 1.5% stake after lukewarm interest from abroad.It initially sought to raise $100bn on two exchanges - with listings on the Saudi Stock Exchange, or Tadawul and an overseas market.The plan was scaled back after foreign investors raised concerns about climate change, political risk, and a lack of corporate transparency.International institutions were also unconvinced by the firm's valuation, prompting Aramco to pull marketing events in New York and London.Instead, it focused its efforts on Saudi Arabian investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies.

Friendly gulf neighbours like the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have also helped bolster the share sale by pumping in billions of dollars. The Kingdom's energy minister is confident that the company's valuation would breach the $2 trillion mark in the coming days. Analysts expect the share price to remain firm in the near future but also say that the real test would be to sustain the momentum in the long run.The IPO is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans to diversify its economy away from oil. The Kingdom's crown prince - Muhammed bin Salman (MbS), who is spearheading the economic strategy - wants to use the IPO proceeds to part-fund some key initiatives announced under a programme called 'Vision 2030' that aims to modernise Saudi Arabia's economy by investing in new industries and multi-billion dollar projects.

HSBC to bring in single overdraft rate of 40%,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50666812,"HSBC is to bring in a single overdraft rate of 39.9% for UK customers from March 2020, as much as quadrupling the rate it charges some customers.However, the bank is removing a £5 daily fee for going into an unarranged overdraft and introducing an interest-free £25 buffer on some accounts.It follows a similar move from Nationwide Building Society in July. It comes in response to tough new borrowing rules from regulators designed to protect consumers. But one analyst warned that steep overdraft rates could now become the ""new normal"". HSBC UK currently charges rates of 9.9% to 19.9% on arranged overdrafts, but the higher rate will be applied across its whole range of accounts except for its student bank account.The £25 buffer will apply to Bank Accounts and Advance Bank Accounts, providing leeway for those going slightly overdrawn.HSBC said that as a result of this and the removal of the £5 daily fee for unarranged overdrafts, seven in 10 who use an overdraft would be better off or the same as a result of the changes.But that suggests around a third could end up worse off. The bank has eight to nine million current account holders in the UK.Madhu Kejriwal, HSBC UK's head of lending and payments, said: ""By simplifying our overdraft charging structure we are making them easier to understand, more transparent and giving customers tools to help them make better financial decisions.""The move comes in response to Financial Conduct Authority's plans to shake up the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market - including stopping banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts.The new rules, which come into force next April, will require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and get rid of fixed fees.But there have been concerns that banks will hike authorised overdraft charges to claw back some revenue lost from unauthorised overdraft fees.In July, Nationwide also unveiled a new single rate of 39.9% across its adult current account range. Its changes came into force in November.Helen Saxon, banking editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ""With both of the first banks to announce changes moving overdraft interest rates to around 40%, we have to wonder if this is the new normal.""The FCA has acknowledged banks may look to increase their arranged overdraft prices as a result of the new rules.But it argues the net effect will still be better for consumers - and increased competition between providers as a result of the changes will constrain any price increases.Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: ""It's disappointing to see such a hike in overdraft charges but there may be more brands coming out in the coming weeks to announce changes too.""This shake-up is designed to make things fairer and more transparent to consumers.""Borrowers would be wise to scrutinise any changes to their current account and look to switch elsewhere if they find that the account has lost its shine."""
Airline boss to lose job over smuggled motorbike,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50682177,"The boss of Indonesia's national airline is being dismissed over allegations he smuggled a classic motorbike into the country.Garuda's chief executive Ari Askhara has been accused of failing to declare the importation of a Harley Davidson and two folding bikes.The country's finance minister said Mr Askhara had avoided up to $107,000 (£82,000) in customs duties.It is a fresh blow to the firm, which has faced questions over its finances.State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir told a news conference that the items were brought into Indonesia from France.""This process was done completely within a state-owned company, not only by an individual,"" Mr Thohir added, according to Reuters.He also said payment for the motorbike was made through a Garuda finance manager in Amsterdam.The ministry would continue to investigate the matter, Mr Thohir said.It was not clear when Mr Askhara, who took up his role as Garuda's chief executive in September 2018, would be forced to leave his position.The State-Owned Enterprises Ministry did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.In June this year, the airline was ordered by the country's financial watchdog to restate its financial results for 2018 over accounting errors."
Another Deliveroo ad banned for being misleading,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50644526,"An advert featuring a woman diving into a Deliveroo delivery bag to retrieve multiple food orders has been banned.The Advertising Standards Authority said it might mislead viewers to think they ""could order food from different restaurants to be delivered together"".The ASA received 300 complaints, the third highest of the year so far. Deliveroo said the advert was about emphasising ""choice"".It is the second time this year that the ASA has banned a Deliveroo advert.In September, the ASA banned a Deliveroo TV advert for wrongly implying that the firm's delivery ""was unrestricted throughout the UK"".The latest ban involves an advert showing a woman taking a delivery from a Deliveroo driver at her front door and then distributing meals from various restaurants around the house from a single bag. At the end, she dives head first into the bag to retrieve the remaining items.During the distribution of the meals the woman calls out restaurant names and type of food: KFC, Wagamama, Pizza Express, Burger King, and others.But complainants said the advert did not specify that each restaurant would need a separate order and incur a delivery fee, with each meal then delivered separately.Although the ASA noted that there was on-screen text to clarify the nature of Deliveroo's service, the regulator concluded: ""The overall impression [was] that customers could order food from different restaurants to be delivered together.""Because that was not the case, and because the ad did not state that a delivery charge would be applied to each order from a different restaurant, we concluded it was likely to mislead.""Deliveroo said the advert clearly stated on screen that ""separate orders must be made for each restaurant"" and had offered to make this clearer. A Deliveroo spokeswoman said: ""This advert underlined the huge choice of great restaurants available on Deliveroo. This is growing each day. For the record, you can't actually dive into your Deliveroo bag, however hungry you are."" Only two other adverts have received more complaints to the ASA this year, one for the comparison website GoCompare and another for a fireworks display.The GoCompare advert, featuring a male opera singer involved in a car accident, received 336 complaints, mostly arguing it trivialised crashes and was distressing. The ASA said it did not break its rules.An advert for Cheltenham Fireworks involving a poster with a picture of a dog wearing ear defenders received 317 complaints, with most saying that it made light of the animal distress caused by fireworks. The advertiser withdrew the poster, and the ASA took no further action."
The surprising fate of plastic in old fridges,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50494949,"As a result of Black Friday many old fridges will be replaced. But what happens to your old fridge, which by law must be disposed of by an approved contractor? Dougal Shaw went to the UK's largest fridge recycling plant to find out.It's like a graveyard for fridges. They are stacked up in columns about six appliances high and this arrangement forms a maze around the industrial site.If you've got rid of an old fridge in the past few years, there's a good chance it's ended up here.The AO Recycling plant in Telford receives 700,000 fridges every year - almost a quarter of the UK's total.The peak season is summer, when fridges tend to fail and get replaced. The other spike is around Black Friday, when many people decide to replace their white goods, if they sniff a deal.The fridges arrive from AO.com's own customers, but also from other retailers and councils.It's been law to dispose of fridges through an approved contractor since 2002 - not least because of the greenhouse gases they contain.Sort then smashAppliances at the plant are first vetted to see if they were retired too early - could they be repaired and resold?If not, their compressor is stripped out. This contains the motor and pump, as well as the refrigerant, the substance which flows around fridges to keep them cool. This needs to be extracted, as it is potentially harmful to the environment. Then a conveyor belt will tip the fridges into a machine known as Bertha, eight at a time.Bertha is the size of a two-story house and you can't see what goes on inside her.First oxygen is sucked out in a sealed chamber so that further greenhouse gases can be recovered from the fridges' insulation foam.Then the fridges fall into another chamber where huge metal chains, like the kind you see holding ships at the docks, whip the white goods at 500 revolutions per minute.This beating reduces them to shreds of plastic and metal, which machines can then separate.However, this rather crude material does not have great potential for recycling - it can only be used to make a few items, like seed pots for plants, for example.So at the moment the final resting place for old fridges may well be in your garden, or perhaps an allotment.'The holy grail'The vast majority of new fridges are manufactured from virgin polymer, derived from crude oil, a dwindling natural resource.This is partly because much of the plastic used in fridges needs to be ""food grade"" to meet safety standards - but also, manufacturers don't want to risk the slightest imperfection creeping into their vast production lines, which run on tight profit margins. Virgin polymers might not be good for the environment, but they are a tried and tested way of getting high quality plastic.""The holy grail,"" explains John Roberts, founder and CEO of AO.com, ""is to add the material recovered from the old fridges back into the supply chain once again, to make new fridges.""This is why his company has just opened a new factory five minutes' drive from the Telford recycling plant, to see if high quality, food-grade plastic can in fact be recovered from old fridges.The new production line is about half the length of a football pitch.A series of machines tries to whittle down the crude fridge waste to recover just the pure, single polymer, food-grade white plastic they want.Water tanks sift out the denser materials, like metals, which sink.Electrostatic machines can separate the various types of plastic in the mix.An optical machine is also used to sort material by colour - the same kind of machine used in peanut factories for quality testing.What comes out at the end of this process are pellets of white plastic, of high purity.However, they are not yet quite pure enough - each batch is tested and so far the results are in the very high 90s - but not quite 100% food-grade quality plastic.A manufacturer's viewIf the technique is perfected, is there an appetite to turn fridge recycling into what's known as a circular economy - feeding the old fridge material back into the supply chain?The mood of manufacturers might be changing, according to Hakan Bulgurlu, chief executive of Arçelik, the global white good manufacturers who own fridge brands like Beko and Grundig.His company manufactures more than 18 million new fridges every year.In the past his marketing teams and engineers would tell him that customers want pristine fridges made of virgin polymers, says Bulgurlu. They told him people would dislike the idea of fridges made from recycled materials. That perception is now reversing, he thinks, as manufacturers realise there is public appetite for white goods that wear their environmental credentials on their sleeves, even if these products cost slightly more.His company tries to use recycled plastic in its production line, he says, but it is a challenge with fridges in particular, because the parts of them which come into contact with food need to be made from food-grade plastic. By contrast, they have already managed to make a vacuum cleaner that is made of 90% recycled plastic.Beko is investing in bioplastics, made from corn husk, which don't use crude oil and can biodegrade, says Bulgurlu. So far they have made one fridge where 25% of its plastic is sourced this way.The real holy grail, he says, ""is a fridge that you can bury and two years later it has disappeared"".Follow Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"
Post-Brexit free trade 'won't offset leaving EU',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50719616,"Post-Brexit trade deals will not make up for the economic damage inflicted on the UK from leaving the EU, analysis for BBC Newsnight has suggested.Independent trade experts from the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) looked at the likely impact of US, Australian and New Zealand free trade deals.They found that even combined, new tariff-cutting agreements were likely to boost the UK economy by just 0.4%.A simple free trade deal would also depress the economy UKTPO said.The body said that moving from full EU membership to a simple deal with our closest trading partner - the objective enshrined in Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement - would depress the size of the economy by at least 1.8%. A Conservative spokesperson said: ""The prime minister's fantastic deal makes clear that we will have a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation. By striking trade deals around the world we will create exciting new opportunities for British businesses."" The Conservative manifesto claims free trade is the ""best way"" to increase exports, cut prices and increase investment.The upshot from this analysis is that there is no realistic prospect of new trade deals with other countries, even the ""ambitious"" deals touted by ministers, offsetting the economic hit from Brexit itself.Moving to an EU free trade deal and striking new free trade agreements with the US, Australia and New Zealand has an estimated negative impact on the UK economy  of 1.4% in the UKTPO results - equivalent to £28bn, or £1,000 per household.The results from the UKTPO, which is based at the University of Sussex, show that moving to a free trade deal with the EU is beneficial overall for the UK agriculture and food processing sector, due to reduced competition from Continental farmers.But that benefit is wiped out if US, Australian and New Zealand trade deals slash import tariffs and quotas, resulting in a surge of agricultural imports.Mr Johnson, in a Commons statement presenting his Brexit Withdrawal Agreement deal on 19 October, stated: ""For the first time in almost five decades the UK will be able to strike free trade deals with our friends across the world to benefit the whole country - including Northern Ireland.""But Newsnight understands that internal UK government impact assessments show that, in fact, only the South East will benefit from US, Australian and New Zealand trade deals, and that the rest of the country will see negative consequencesNorthern Ireland is, sources say, particularly badly affected due to its agriculture industry being severely hit.The UKTPO used what is known as a partial equilibrium trade model to look at the likely impact on 148 individual UK industrial sectors of slashing tariff and non-tariff barriers.Prof Michael Gasiorek led the modelling project for UKTPO. He was unsurprised by the results. ""It's arithmetic,"" he said. ""Tariffs on many goods are already quite low or zero so there are no great gains from lowering them. ""Also relative to how much we trade with the EU, we do much less with the US, Australia and New Zealand, so the overall impact on output is not massive. ""It certainly doesn't offset the negative impact of leaving the EU. Further, agreeing on the removal of regulatory barriers will be difficult - as the EU had found in its negotiations with the US.""The UKTPO results are in line with the findings of a Treasury modelling exercise in 2018, which estimated the benefit of any new trade deals would only be between 0.1 and 0.2% of GDP - a benefit dwarfed by the negative impact of leaving the EU's single market and customs union.Newsnight understands the Department for International Trade has now completed fresh impact assessments of US, Australian and New Zealand trade deals, which show results similar to the UKTPO findings, but that these are not due to be published until after Brexit and ahead of the publication of mandates for trade negotiators.You can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

The secrets of 'food porn' viral videos,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50676131,"I've just watched a fresh turkey being covered in fragments of cheese-flavoured crisps and then stuffed with what looks like three kilos of cheddar.The video has more than four million views on YouTube. Call it a stunt, call it a travesty, whatever you make of it this is food - but not as you know it.It's an extreme example of a so-called ""food porn"" video, a viral clip of an excessively indulgent recipe designed to shock or delight in equal measure. While responses to the cheese-stuffed turkey video were mixed to say the least, videos that revel in stringy, gooey melted cheese, lashings of melted chocolate, or heinous quantities of barbecue sauce are all the rage. Observe a rainbow bagel filled with cream cheese or a 100-layer lasagne in the making.They are shared far and wide on social media and evidence is growing to suggest that they are changing consumer expectations. Some of the most well-known creators behind these videos include Tasty, BuzzFeed Brand, Twisted, Spoon University and Chefclub.Their clips take the form of visual recipes, usually filmed in a top-down format, focusing entirely on the food itself and cooking utensils. The final shots often show slow-motion close-ups of the resulting dish.""For me, watching those kind of things the initial reaction is, they're disgusting, they're so gross, they're also incredibly wasteful, they're ludicrously unhealthy,"" says Thom Eagle, food writer and freelance chef.""The term 'food porn' is apt because it's completely unrealistic.""And yet Mr Eagle, who specialises in modern restaurant cuisine and fermentation recipes, has witnessed the power of social media. Stick a dish on Instagram, he says, and the punters will come looking: ""That's what sells the most the next day at the restaurant.""People nowadays like to eat exactly what they want, when they want it, and are - for instance - increasingly using food delivery apps for that purpose. More Technology of BusinessThe meal delivery market in the UK grew 13.4% year-on-year in 2018 and is up again this year, according to industry data, says Kim Malley at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).It's a safe bet that apps have revolutionised the sector, she says.But what about videos of food? There are clues there too. The AHDB tracks consumer opinion on cooking and food purchasing habits. The body asks what sources people use to inspire their cooking at home. ""12% claim that they've looked at YouTube for recipe inspiration,"" she says. ""To put that into perspective, in 2015 that was only at 4%.""Firms that make the ingredients we cook with are keen to cash in on the eye-popping food craze. One marketing agency that works with brands to make social media videos in this style is Dish Works, based in Pennsylvania.""I think that cheese is maybe one of the sexiest things you can use in a video,"" says Mary Bigham, president and co-founder. ""When you see cheese pulls and melty, bubbly cheese, you gotta stop and look at it.""She calls it ""stretch appeal"" and says her team have a heat gun in their studio so that when pizzas, tacos or quesadillas are being filmed, the cheese can be coaxed to just the right level of lusciousness.This visual language is not confined to cheese. Ms Bigham says that condiments like ketchup or mayonnaise, dressings and unctuous sauces poured in slow motion can all improve the likelihood that viewers will salivate over of the final video.One New York restaurant capitalised on exactly this a few years ago. Raclette NYC serves raclette, a Swiss cheese that is usually brought to the table heated and melting. It is then scraped on to other things on your plate.Raclette NYC posted a video showing off its dishes online and was immediately swamped with eight million views online overnight. The next day, the restaurant was overwhelmed with customers and the head chef had to hire 10 new staff members to cope with demand.This is the effect food companies, restaurants and influencers are all chasing.Ms Bigham says that the general goal for many purveyors of food porn is to nudge the viewer into wanting to try to make the dish at home for themselves. It looks delicious - and straightforward to make - so why not?That does raise a question, though. As Mr Eagle points out, a lot of these recipes are unhealthy. Cheese is high in salt and saturated fat - a little goes a long way. Plus, the portion sizes in many viral food videos are gargantuan. For her part, Ms Bigham argues she's never had a client request a video that she felt was unreasonably unhealthy.But if excess is part of what makes many food videos go viral, that could be bad news for the obesity epidemic.""My opinion is that these videos, they really show recipes which are calorific, they contain an excessive amount of fat,"" says Roberta Alessandrini, a nutritionist at Queen Mary University of London, referring to widely shared clips of deep-fried pizzas and towering burgers.""They don't really depict an idea of what a healthy diet should be. On the other [hand] I think that cooking is a positive thing.""Dr Alessandrini says research indicates that people who cook at home often have better diets overall.If constructing the occasional 100-layer lasagne gets them into the kitchen, perhaps the overall effect might be a good one?"
UK drivers fight for VW 'dieselgate' compensation,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50631823,"Volkswagen ""cheated"" European emissions rules designed ""to save lives"" by installing unlawful ""defeat devices"" in diesel cars, the High Court has heard.Tens of thousands of UK motorists who bought VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda diesel cars are taking legal action in the aftermath of the ""dieselgate"" scandal.The claimants' QC Tom de la Mare said: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used.""Volkswagen has said it will ""defend robustly its position"".In 2015, VW admitted 11 million cars worldwide - including 1.2 million in the UK - had software that reduced readings of emissions in tests. However, the UK hearing, expected to last two weeks, centres on whether that software constitutes a ""defeat device"" under EU regulations.In his opening remarks, Mr de la Mare told the court that VW engines were ""optimised to minimise the amount of pollutants"" in emissions tests, meaning the vehicles operated in a ""completely different way in the street to how it operated in the test"".He added: ""It is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used."" Mr de la Mare said European emissions standards were designed ""to save lives"", adding that ""the most up-to-date evidence"" showed that pollution was ""killing approximately 1,000 people a day in Europe"".He said internal VW documents showed that the company has ""long known that the software was unlawful and indefensible"", pointing to one document in which a VW employee said the vehicles would ""flunk"" emissions tests without the software.He submitted that the documents showed a ""clear acceptance that the software was the only basis on which they were meeting the emissions limits"".VW's barrister, Michael Fordham QC, argued in written submissions that the claimants had misunderstood the legal definition of a defeat device.In a statement before the hearing, a VW spokeswoman said: ""Volkswagen Group continues to defend robustly its position in the High Court in London.""It remains Volkswagen Group's case that the claimants did not suffer any loss at all and that the affected vehicles did not contain a prohibited defeat device.""Volkswagen has faced a flurry of legal action worldwide, and has been forced to pay out more than €30bn (£26bn) in fines, recall costs and civil settlements. The carmaker's current and former senior employees are facing criminal charges in Germany.The English litigation was filed back in 2016, but has now reached what the claimants' lawyers have called ""a decisive court battle"".Gareth Pope, head of group litigation at Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 70,000 of almost 90,000 claimants, said before the start of the hearing: ""This trial will establish once and for all whether VW installed prohibited 'defeat devices' in affected vehicles and is a significant milestone in our clients' attempts to hold VW accountable in the UK.""This is a decisive point for VW. For years, the carmaker has deceived its customers, marketing cars as complying with emissions standards while all the time knowing they were emitting many times more than the allowed level of toxic pollutants, perpetrating an environmental and health scandal.""VW has had plenty of opportunity to come clean, make amends and move on from this highly damaging episode.""But instead it's chosen to spend millions of pounds denying the claims our clients have been forced to bring against it rather than paying that to their own customers in compensation.""One of the claimants, Brian Levine - who bought two affected Volkswagens - told the Press Association: ""VW's tactics have been to delay and prevaricate - anything but face a day when it would have to explain what this software did. Well, that day has finally come.""More than four years after the emissions scandal broke, the tens of thousands of customers will be able to hold VW to account in a British court of law and expose its efforts to cheat us.""Buying a car is one of the big financial decisions we make. We pay a hefty price for a brand we trust and expect the specifications to be as promised.But VW argues that the drivers claiming they were fooled by a defeat device will not qualify for compensation whatever the merits of their case, because they haven't suffered a loss.And VW denies having a defeat device, anyway, despite findings against the carmaker in other countries.Waiting for a result from this case will feel like being trapped in the mother of all traffic jams. Lawyers involved are expecting the whole process could take two to three years."
How to have a more sustainable Christmas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50662378,"There's nothing like 15,000 Christmas trees to get you into the holiday mood, as for many of us, picking out a festive fir signals the start of the holiday season.Unsurprisingly it's the busiest time of the year for Alastair and Diane Lucking, who run Love A Christmas Tree in Kirkby Mallory, Leicestershire. They started growing trees in the fields near their house in 2013, and two years later decided to let customers rent trees as an alternative to buying a single use cut one.""The renting idea evolved from a eureka moment whilst on holiday,"" says Alastair.""It covered two aspirations, to be more environmental than any current tree offering - real or plastic - and creating a business disrupter product for the Christmas tree market."" The Luckings import saplings from Denmark and replant them, letting them get tall enough to rent out. They're grown in special containers with tiny holes around the side, which allows the smaller roots to grow into the surrounding soil.When the trees are harvested those smaller roots break off, but the majority of the roots stay in the pot, which makes replanting relatively easy. ""When the trees are replanted they continue to grow, and some people rent the same tree each year,"" says Alastair. ""We tie a tag to each one with a number, and name, and record it in a book. One of our customers has a young family member who measures his height against the tree each year to see how much he's grown."" Prices vary according to size but a 1.5m (5ft) tree costs £30 to rent. Trees are delivered from the beginning of December, and are picked back up from customers in the first week of January when they're replanted.  ""We have 1,500 trees available to rent this year. Customers love having a real live tree, but they hate having to take it to the skip to be chipped at the end of Christmas,"" says Alastair.He and Diane are also working on making other areas of the business as environmentally friendly as possible. The biggest area of wastage is the plastic netting used to wrap round the trees when they're taken out the ground. ""We've been working with our supplier to source a biodegradable alternative, and this year the netting is made from potato starch which is 100% biodegradable,"" says Alastair.The notion of a sustainable Christmas doesn't stop at trees - for the eco-aware it can encompass everything from presents, to party wear and food. At the recent Spirit of Christmas fair in London's Olympia, many of the stallholders were promoting their environmental credentials. In a cosy corner of the hall, Nicole Paskauskas was manning the stand for her biodegradable glitter company, Disco Dust London. It sells an array of sparkling hair, face and body products minus the microplastics often found in glitter. ""Instead of plastics we use cellulose film, sourced from hard woods like eucalyptus. In wetlands it's broken down by microorganisms in the water, so when it's washed off, animals aren't ingesting the glitter, and it doesn't become part of the food chain. We also sell aloe vera gel to stick the glitter on with."" But bio-glitter is a relatively new product, and Nicole says there are limitations.""Certain shapes and effects have to be made out of plastic, so we can't sell anything neon, UV, glow in the dark, iridescent or holographic."" At the other end of the hall, Jamie Griffiths from Oarsum is selling gifts made from recycled sailcloth. His wares range from holdalls, to pencil cases, and dog beds. ""Once sails are ripped, a chandler [a supplier of sailing equipment] can't use them, so rather than them ending up in landfill we repurpose them."" The robust nature of the material makes for sturdy, waterproof products, including a backgammon board that Mr Griffiths spreads out in front of a sail cloth deckchair. ""If you spill a glass a wine on it, it'll dry out in no time,"" he says as a customer admires an overnight bag emblazoned with a pink flamingo. You've bought the presents, rented the tree and put on your best sparkles, but Christmas wouldn't be complete without the food. Or would it? Fiona Oakes runs Tower Hill Stables Animal Sanctuary in Essex, and encourages people to sponsor rather than eat a turkey, which she then cares for on her farm.  ""We have 23 turkeys and they come from just about everywhere, "" she says as a flock of eight inquisitive birds pecks at our feet. ""These are from a farm in Hertfordshire. One of our supporters approached the farmer and asked if it would be possible to buy them alive, not dead. They're in remarkably good condition, not just physically but mentally; they've already developed personalities."" That's not always the case however. ""We had one turkey called Big Bird, she was over 55lbs, and she was off her feet when she came,"" says Fiona. ""We built her a little cart, she got round on that, and then eventually got back on her feet. We slimmed her down, she had a rigorous exercise programme, we modified her diet, and she actually did live for quite a long time."" Ms Oakes says that like herself many sponsors are vegan, including Leah Griffin, and her nine-year old daughter Lexi, who pay £10 a month towards the upkeep of a turkey. ""I like sponsoring the turkeys because I think they should be saved rather than eaten. They're really cute and they're funny, I like the noise they make,"" says Lexi.  The evening is drawing in and the lights from the barns are starting to twinkle like a scene in an alternative Nativity play - albeit one that includes more poultry than usual. "
'I match clothes with my pug',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50391708,"When you think about the people who match their clothes with their partners, do you perhaps think of them in matching anoraks at a computer games party or in matching husky jumpers at a tourist attraction?

Why do we give money to charity?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50337091,"""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages."" When economist Adam Smith was writing his highly influential book The Wealth of Nations, in the 1770s, his mail probably didn't include envelopes with arresting images of hungry children. And when he strolled around his home town of Kirkcaldy, Fife, he was not accosted by clipboard-wielding young women trying to sign him up for a monthly donation. These days, we are frequently spoken to not of our advantages but of other people's necessities.Charity has become big business, though it's hard to say how big: there's little good data. One recent study estimates the British, for example, donate 54p in every £100. That's three times more than the Germans but three times less than Americans give.  By my reckoning, that's also roughly what Britons spend on beer, not much less than they spend on meat and three times what they spend on bread.  In economic significance, the charity fundraiser is up there with the butcher, brewer and baker.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Charity, of course, is as old as humanity. The ancient religious custom of tithing - indirectly giving a 10th of one's income to worthy causes  - makes modern donations of less than £1 in every £100 seem derisory. Still, taxes have replaced tithes and many modern fundraisers don't have the advantage of claiming to speak for God. They need to be professional about persuasion - and there is a man who's regarded as the father of the field: Charles Sumner Ward. In the late-19th Century, he started work for the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was ""a medium-sized man,"" according to the New York Post, ""so mild of manner that one would never suspect him of the power to sway hitherto reluctant pocketbooks"".  That power first gained wide attention in 1905, when his employers sent him to Washington DC to raise money for a new building. Ward found a wealthy donor to pledge a chunk of cash - but only if the public raised the rest. He then set an artificial deadline for this to happen. The papers lapped it up.  Ward applied his methods far and wide: a target; a time limit; a campaign clock, showing progress; publicity stunts planned with military precision.In the modern world, they all seem familiar but when Ward came to London in 1912, they were novel. The Times was suitably impressed by his ""knowledge of human nature, and an extremely shrewd application of business principles in securing the advantage at the psychological moment"". World War One brought more fundraising innovations: lotteries; and flag days, which have modern equivalents in wristbands, ribbons and stickers that show you've given money.  By 1924, Ward had a fundraising company and was advertising how much it had raised for everything from boy scouts to masonic temples.  For the modern heirs of Charles Sumner Ward, what counts as a ""shrewd application of business principles""? We can get some clues from advertising executives interviewed for the Guardian newspaper. Images of starving children don't rack up many ""likes"" on social media, they say, build your brand instead, engage and entertain. Economists have also studied what motivates donations. One theory is called ""signalling"": we donate in part to impress other people. That might explain the enduring popularity of wristbands, ribbons and stickers: they display not only the causes that matter to us but our generosity too.  Then there's the ""warm glow"" theory, which says we give in order to feel nice - or less guilty, at least.Experimental investigations of these ideas have produced results that are - well, a little depressing. Economist John List and colleagues sent people to knock on doors; some asked for a donation, others sold lottery tickets for the same good cause. The lottery tickets raised a lot more; no surprise there. But the researchers also found attractive young women who asked for donations fared much better - about as well as the lottery sellers. As the study drily acknowledges: ""This result is largely driven by increased participation rates among households where a male answered the door.""That's evidence for the signalling theory of altruism - and you can see exactly what kind of pretty young lady these gentlemen were keen to signal to. Another economist, James Andreoni, studied the ""warm glow"" idea by asking what happened to private donations when a charity started getting a government subsidy? If donors gave purely from an altruistic desire to ensure the charity could function, then the donations should move to another worthy cause when the subsidy arrives. But that doesn't happen, which suggests we aren't purely altruistic - we just get a warm glow from feeling that we are.  It's starting to sound like Adam Smith's logic applies to charity after all. ""It is not from the benevolence of the donor that we expect a contribution,"" a fundraiser might say, ""but from their regard to making themselves feel good or look good to others."" But if charities are selling a warm glow and the ability to send social signals, that doesn't give them much incentive to do anything useful. They just have to tell us a good story.Some people, of course, take very seriously the question of how much good charities do. There's a movement calling for ""effective altruism"", featuring organisations such as GiveWell, which studies charities' effectiveness and recommends who might deserve our cash.  The economists Dean Karlan and Daniel Wood wondered whether evidence of effectiveness would improve fundraising, and worked with a charity to find out. Some supporters got a typical mailshot, an emotional story about an individual beneficiary called Sebastiana. ""She's known nothing but abject poverty her entire life,"" it read.Others got the same story but with an additional paragraph noting that ""rigorous scientific methodologies"" confirmed the charity's impact. The results? Some people who'd previously given big donations seemed impressed and gave more. But that was cancelled out by small donors giving less. Merely mentioning science seemed to have punctured the emotional appeal and cooled the warm glow. And this may explain why GiveWell hasn't even tried to assess the household names of the charity world - the likes of Oxfam, Save The Children, and World Vision. In an exasperated-sounding blog post, the organisation explains such charities ""tend to publish a great deal of web content aimed at fundraising but very little of interest for impact-oriented donors"". Or, as Adam Smith might have said: ""Never talk to them of our own effectiveness"".The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Pound surges to two-year high against the euro,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50656107,"Sterling has jumped after opinion polls suggested the UK would avoid a hung parliament after next week's election. The pound reached a seven month high against the dollar and its highest level against the euro since May 2017.The move came after polls suggested a 10-point lead for the Conservative party and a parliamentary majority.However, analysts cautioned against relying too much on one poll and said the pound gained momentum after it went past the $1.30 mark.The pound has risen sharply since October, gaining 6% in two months, after the EU granted Britain an extension to its departure from the bloc.This week sterling climbed further as investors saw the prospect of a hung parliament receding. Jeremy Stretch at CIBC World Markets said move was caused by traders consolidating all the recent polls and deciding that a Conservative majority was the most likely outcome.The markets see that as ending the stalemate over Brexit.However, Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, said: ""As we saw in 2017, polls can sharply narrow as we approach polling day.""If a repeat situation pans out, seeing Labour gain ground and hung parliament territory approach, sterling will likely face stiff headwinds.""The pound gained as much as 0.83% on Wednesday to touch $1.31 while against the euro, the pound hit a high of €1.183, up 0.84%.Jane Foley from Rabobank said the pound's rise was mainly due to ""technical reasons"" after it went over the ""psychological"" $1.30 level.The initial referendum result in 2016 sent the pound sharply lower against other currencies. Since then its value has tended to rise when a Brexit deal, particularly one maintaining closer ties with the EU, was in prospect. "
Coral dredging: 'It's going to cause irreversible damage',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50647625,"Campaigners in the Cayman Islands say they are fighting a ""David and Goliath"" battle against the world's biggest cruise lines that want to redevelop the country's port to accommodate huge ships. ""I fear that it's going to cause some irreversible damage that we can't ever change, take back or fix in the future,"" says Michelle Lockwood, one of those opposed to the coral dredging that will be needed to enlarge the port. It's just gone 9am in Grand Cayman and the Royal Watler Cruise Terminal is already crowded. Hundreds of tourists are disembarking from a fleet of small tenders from two enormous ships anchored just off George Town harbour, that loom like giant white whales. As the visitors step onto the dock, some of them pose for a photograph with workers dressed as pirates. This is the Caribbean after all. But away from the holiday-makers heading for the island's famous Seven Mile Beach, tension is in the air. The cruise ships and the coral reef beneath them are at the heart of a dispute that has pitted local scientists, conservationists and small businesses against the world's largest cruise companies - Royal Caribbean and Carnival - with a combined market value of $55bn (£42bn).The cruise lines are leading a consortium - Verdant Isle - to build a $250m new jetty and berthing facility on Grand Cayman. They say their new liners, which will carry almost 9,000 people, won't use the tenders to ferry passengers ashore. It will make disembarking quicker and easier for tourists but it means dredging the harbour - destroying at least 10 acres (4ha) of coral reef. ""It's a really unique area, that's why Cayman is so famous for its diving and snorkelling, it's just pristine,"" says Nadia Hardie, the head of The National Trust for the Cayman Islands. ""There are so many different varieties of marine life but also coral, we have endangered species here which we have to protect and that's what's really at risk."" Caymanians will vote on the proposal in a referendum expected early next year. ""We know that a pier is much better for the guest experience,"" says TJ O'Sullivan of Royal Caribbean Cruises. ""Guests will come off the ship at a much higher rate and spend more time in port.""But many local tour operators are unconvinced. They say cruise firms already take most of what passengers spend by pre-selling tours onboard. They worry that by funding the port redevelopment, the cruise companies will have greater control of the local tourism sector.""We will be left out,"" says one guide who doesn't want to be named. ""Pre-booked [tours] will increase more, they will force us out of business.""Mario Blanchette is a scuba instructor at the nearby Eden Rock Diving Centre. ""Unfortunately, they will be digging a lot. All that silt and sand will eventually start making its way over our reef. ""Eventually Eden Rock and other businesses that rely on the reef will have to shut down.""His concerns are shared by lifeguard Bernard Rockett. ""People come here for the diving experience - to see the beautiful creatures that we have in the water and the coral life,"" he says. The Verdant Isle consortium says the amount of material clouding the water will be closely monitored, as corals die if they get smothered.""We'll have turbidity, silt-monitoring buoys that read in real time,"" says Barry Loudermilk of Orion Marine Group, the firm set to dredge the harbour if the project goes ahead. And dredging will be carried out by a specialised backhoe that operators say has a lower impact on the environment than hydraulic dredging. I ask him if he's certain there won't be lasting damage to the reef. ""What I'm certain of is, if there is a 'yes' vote, we have a lot of [environmental] modelling to do. I think a lot of the fears will be settled once we complete all our modelling.""  So isn't that a bit of a risk? ""Everything's a risk,"" says Mr Loudermilk. ""But we've brought the best specialised teams to handle the delicate environmental approach to this project.""Opponents point to the experience of Falmouth, Jamaica. In 2009, Royal Caribbean built a $170m new pier but the number of cruise ships visiting Jamaica has since fallen.Opposition Cayman Islands legislative assembly member Chris Saunders says the Cayman Islands had almost 60% more cruise passengers than Jamaica in June even though Jamaica has three main ports and Grand Cayman has none. ""The cruise lines already skilfully beguiled the Jamaican people with regards to the port in Falmouth and they are trying to do the same with Cayman. Let's not make the same mistake.""Royal Caribbean says tourists have become less interested in visiting Jamaica, and that's been reflected in the company's itineraries. The Cayman Islands government is confident the new facilities will boost cruise tourism - meaning more jobs for islanders. To help fund the project, its agreed that part of the tax tourists pay to visit the Cayman Islands will be given to Verdant Isle - for 25 years.Cayman Deputy Premier Moses Kirkconnell says the government has a responsibility to develop the country for the next generation. ""The balance that we have to understand, from a government policy, is how do we balance the need of the people for a job and opportunity compared to our environment that we have to protect."" Only 1% of the Cayman Islands' reef will be affected, he says. But Cruise Port Referendum (or CPR) Cayman, a grassroots group opposed to the development, says the economic arguments for the project are weak as overnight tourists spend far more than cruise passengers.Last year, 1.9 million cruise passengers visited the Cayman Islands bringing in $200m (22% of tourism revenue) while 460,000 overnight tourists brought in $680m (78% of tourism revenue).""Overnight tourism is really where the money's at and luxury-stay tourists even more so,"" says CPR Cayman's Michelle Lockwood. The group says healthy reefs are vital to attract the higher-spending overnight holiday-makers. Verdant Isle has sought to allay these fears by promising to relocate 30-50% of the common coral that's removed, and 100% of rare corals. It's hired Florida-based marine consultant Dr David Vaughan who plans to use a technique called micro-fragmentation to plant new corals, alongside those that have been moved. ""This is a new technology [that involves] reskinning the tissue back on a dead coral head or a rock,"" he says. ""It's not the reason the referendum should be 'yay' or 'nay', but it's something to add to mix."" But the science of coral relocation is hotly debated. Not all marine experts are convinced it can work. Terry Hughes, a professor in marine biology from James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, who has been studying coral reefs since the 1970s, says: ""It's very difficult to move corals. ""They often break apart and they're injured fatally when you try to detach them - then when you relocate them they're often very unhappy and have high rates of loss.""Michelle Lockwood from CPR Cayman says: ""The cruise lines... they're in this for profit, they're not in this for what's best for the Cayman Islands."""
Cambodia's bicycle firms face bumps in the road,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50388764,"Made in Cambodia is a common label on clothing from shirts and skirts to cycling shorts, but these days there's a good chance the bicycle itself will also have been made there.The south east Asian nation is making the most of shifting global trade patterns to diversify its economy, and it is now listed as the fifth-largest exporter of bicycles in the world after China, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Germany.But concerns over democratic freedoms mean there could be bumps in the road ahead.At the Bavet Special Economic Zone, right on Cambodia's border with Vietnam, and just 50km north west of Ho Chi Minh City, the industry is gearing up to make the most of growing demand.Inside a factory belonging to Taiwanese-owned firm Speedtech, bicycle frames hang from hooks like meat carcasses at a market.Workers, some in protective goggles or welding masks, are engrossed in their tasks along the production line, ignoring the biting scent of spray paint. The starting salary of $350 (£268) a month compares well with the garment industry, but the air is humid and heavy, and when the monsoon downpour arrives in early afternoon there's a whoop of delight but no pause in production. When Speedtech first arrived at Bavet in 2013 it was only doing final assembly, says vice-general manager, Aliette Tong. Now the workers weld and paint frames too. The factory can turn out up to 2,000 bicycles a day if the demand is there, he adds. But the industry still has shallow roots.At Speedtech everything other than the frame is imported from Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan or China, explains Mr Tong. Even the steel used to make the frame is imported from China.""In this period, parts makers are more are interested in Vietnam,"" he says. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Moreover, the finished bicycles are exported, not from Cambodia's main port at Preah Sihanouk, which is a gruelling nine-hour drive to the west, but via Ho Chi Minh City's Cat Lai port, four to five hours east of here, even though that entails additional customs processes at the border.What prompted Speedtech to move its operations from Vietnam to Cambodia in the first place, alongside two other Taiwanese-owned manufacturers, A & J and Smart Tech, was a decision by the European Union in 2005 to impose anti-dumping measures on Vietnam, making Vietnamese exports more expensive.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:A similar pressure is now growing on firms manufacturing in China. President Trump's trade war has pushed up the cost of their products in the US. And at least three manufacturers are yanking production out of China to open factories in Cambodia instead.One of them, Shanghai General Sports, has registered to operate at a site near Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Already, US-based bicycle brand Kent International has pledged to move around 60% of its cycling manufacturing to the new plant by 2022. ""It will take a long time for Cambodia to get to the efficiencies of China, if ever,"" says Kent's chief executive, Arnold Kamler, but at least for now the lower productivity and the added transport costs in Cambodia are less of a problem than rising costs in China.Now the greatest danger for Cambodia's cycle makers is that the country could face new tariffs on its own exports.Cambodia currently enjoys tariff-free access to the EU under what is known as the Everything But Arms arrangement (EBA) designed to support low income countries. But in February the EU could cancel that preferential access, when it publishes the results of a review into Cambodia's political situation.Since the end of the devastating Khmer Rouge regime more than three decades ago, the country has been ruled by one party under the same leader, Hun Sen, who is increasingly seen as an authoritarian figure.Over the last two years critics have been jailed, the main opposition party dissolved and radio stations closed, in what the EU described as a ""deterioration of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.""In Washington there have also been calls for a review of the US's preferential trade relationship with Cambodia.When the subject of Cambodia's trade status comes up, the polite, chatty manager at Speedtech, Mr Tong goes quiet for a moment. Prices are likely to rise if preferential status is lost, he admits. Mr Kalman has said that Kent will stick to producing in Cambodia whatever happens to its trade status since costs are rising rapidly in China.But others may not.Robert Margevicius, the executive vice-president for US-based Specialized Bicycles, which uses Speedtech in Cambodia as well as suppliers in Vietnam and Taiwan, warns the ""volatile"" situation over trade risks putting the brakes on Cambodia's exports.""Any issues with [the EU] or if the US turns on Cambodia for political dissonance, it could be an unstable foundation for the bicycle industry,"" he says.  Manufacturers could migrate back to Vietnam, he believes, especially once the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement comes into effect next year. ""Cambodia could be a short-term solution until things heat up in Vietnam,""  Mr Margevicius says.Crucially, Cambodia needs to start making more components domestically, for the bicycles to continue to count as Cambodian-made. If too many parts and materials come from China the final product will end up subject to the same punishingly high tariffs as Chinese bicycles.Moun Channheak, from Cambodia's Ministry of Commerce says the government is doing its utmost to support a sector that employs thousands of people and exports around $400m worth of finished bicycles a year. ""We gained success with bicycle exports to the EU and other countries but we need to invest in components manufacturing,"" he says. ""We need investments in Cambodia instead of importing material."" It may be hard to attract that investment while the country's trade status remains in flux, points out Mr Margevicius.One thing he will say for Cambodia though is the progress that has been made so far, in the quality of the work and the shift towards higher specification designs.  ""What I have found about Cambodian workers is that they are craftspeople,"" Mr Margevicius says. ""They take pride in their work."""
Peloton bike ad labelled 'sexist' and 'dystopian',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50649826,"A Christmas advert from exercise bike company Peloton has been widely mocked on social media as being ""sexist"", ""out of touch"", and even ""dystopian"".The ad, which has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube, sees a woman receive an exercise bike for Christmas from her husband.She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says.Criticism of it has been so viral it infected the company's shares, which closed more than 9% lower on Tuesday.Peloton was not immediately available to comment after being contacted by the BBC.Peloton sells fitness equipment - with bikes priced at more than $2,000 - fitted with touchscreens. Users then purchase a subscription to access classes streamed live and on-demand. The New York-based company released the ad on 21 November, but criticism on social media has increased markedly in recent days. Some people complained it is sexist for a man to give his wife an exercise bike for Christmas, as it suggested he wanted her to lose weight. Others noted that - despite claims the bike has ""changed"" her - the already slim actress who plays the main character looks exactly same.Some also said the ad had a dystopian vibe and compared it to a horror film.Comedy writer Jess Dweck wrote on Twitter: ""The only way to enjoy that Peloton ad is to think of it as the first minute of an episode of Black Mirror.""A Twitter account devoted to Limericks wrote: ""The Pelaton [sic] wife/Has a beautiful life/And a general aura of fear.""The ad has also spawned parody commercials, with at least one suggesting giving the bike would lead to divorce.To date, the firm's Twitter account has not weighed in on the debate. But it has turned off comments on the YouTube video of the ad. It is not the first time Peloton's appeals to buyers have been spoofed.ClueHeywood, a Twitter personality in Arizona, called out the company earlier this year for the absurdity of how it staged its adverts. ""Love putting my Peloton bike in the most striking area of my ultra-modern $3 million house,"" he wrote.He offered his take on the most recent commercial as well, describing it as an account of a ""116 lb woman's YEARLONG fitness journey to becoming a 112 lb woman""."
Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50129510,"The central element in the Conservatives' election pitch is a commitment to ""get Brexit done"". Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU would indeed end the UK's membership.But it would leave some very important Brexit-related challenges still to do, including the UK's future trade relationship with the bloc, and with the rest of the world.  Some people are worried that we might face a new ""cliff-edge"" at the end of 2020. Under Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement, the existing arrangements between the EU and UK would temporarily continue, with goods and services being allowed to flow freely across the various borders with the continent.That arrangement is due to end on 31 December 2020.If Boris Johnson wins a majority he says he would negotiate a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU ready to go into operation at the end of 2020.An FTA is an agreement between two countries which eliminates trade taxes, known as tariffs, with the aim of making business and commerce run more smoothly. FTAs often also include measures to reduce other types of regulatory barriers that make trade more difficult.The aim is to have a deal done in time for the end of 2020. That is a very challenging timetable.Trade negotiations tend to take several years to complete. They are technically challenging and politically contentious. Both those features can make them drag on.To take one example, the EU's deal with Canada took more than five years for negotiators to complete and another three before it came into force, on a provisional basis.The UK-EU negotiation will be unusual in that it is intended to establish a trade relationship that is less integrated than what the two sides have now.Usually, trade negotiations make for closer commercial relations, so past experience isn't necessarily a good guide to the likely timetable.Some people say that because we are already fully aligned with the EU the negotiation will be easy and quick.But for many Brexit supporters the freedom to depart from EU rules is one of the main prizes. How much we depart - on food standards for example - will be important for the EU in judging what restrictions to impose on British goods. That could be a time-consuming process.Yes. There is a provision in the Withdrawal Agreement to extend the transition period by one or two years, but that decision must be taken by 1 July. So there would only be a few months of negotiating time before an extension would need to be agreed. Will there have been enough progress by then to allow us to be confident that it can all be done in another six months? After that date an extension could not be done with the arrangements in the Withdrawal Agreement. The Agreement itself would have to be amended or a new treaty agreed. There is some debate about whether that would be legally possible. If there is no agreement the trade relationship would default to what is known as World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - which is what trade relations would be if we left the EU now with no deal.WTO terms mean British exporters would have the same access to the EU as do other countries with no trade agreement. That means the EU would apply to UK goods the same tariffs it applies to goods from the US or China for example. For cars that would be 10%. EU tariffs are particularly high for some agricultural products. British exporters would also face regulatory barriers they currently don't.UK exports would not face tariffs going into the EU. Whether they would have to go through some checks and tests to show compliance with EU rules would depend on exactly what was agreed.So exporting could involve more red tape and more costs for UK firms.This is one reason why many economists think the UK economy will be smaller with this kind of deal than it would have been had we stayed in the EU.How easily services businesses could supply clients in the EU would depend on the extent of regulatory alignment and on what agreement can be reached on working and travelling across borders.It would probably be more difficult. One clear potential trouble spot is product regulations, especially food standards.The US and EU tried to negotiate a wide ranging deal that ran aground partly on that issue.There were particular issues about chlorine-rinsed chicken, growth-promoting hormones used in beef production, and genetically modified (GM) foods.The US wanted to be able to sell these foods (or to do so more easily in the case of GM foods) in the EU. The EU wouldn't agree.In a UK-US trade negotiation, the Americans will want easier access for their foods to the UK.The EU would be very wary of any such foods in circulation in the UK finding their way into the EU's single market.If they thought that was a risk they would be more reluctant to allow unrestricted access for UK goods, lest some of the controversial US food should get in.The term ""no-deal"" was often used to mean no withdrawal agreement. So the scenario of no FTA at the end of next year is not no-deal in that sense. Ratifying Mr Johnson's deal would mean an agreement covering citizens' rights (EU citizens here and British on the continent) the financial contribution and the Irish border. But ""no deal"" is also sometimes used as meaning no trade agreement and a WTO terms trade relationship with the EU and that scenario is a possible outcome of Mr Johnson's approach. "
US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50750746,"US aviation regulators allowed Boeing's 737 Max aircraft to continue flying despite knowing there was a risk of further crashes.Analysis after the first crash last year predicted there could be up to 15 disasters over the lifetime of the aircraft without design changes.Despite this, the Federal Aviation Administration did not ground the Max until a second crash five months later.FAA chief Steve Dickson, who started in August, said this was a mistake.The FAA risk assessment was revealed during a US congressional hearing on Wednesday. Lawmakers are investigating Boeing following fatal 737 Max crashes in Indonesia in October 2018, and Ethiopia in March. The disasters killed 346 people in total.Air safety officials investigating the crashes have identified an automated control system in the 737 Max 8, known as MCAS, as a factor in both accidents. Boeing has said the system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards. The FAA's investigation of the October Indonesia crash called for Boeing to redesign its system, warning of a risk of more than a dozen crashes over the 45-year lifetime of the roughly 4,800 737 Max planes in service.Regulators also issued an alert to airlines, but the agency did not ground the aircraft until after the 10 March Ethiopia crash, several days after action by other countries.""Was a mistake made?"" asked Democrat congressman Henry Johnson.""Obviously the result was not satisfactory,"" said Mr Dickson. In response to later questions, he admitted the agency had made a mistake at some point in the process. Boeing is revising the MCAS software, but lawmakers say their investigation has shown that the aircraft manufacturer was aware of flaws in the system.Boeing staff have also raised concerns that the company was prioritising speed over safety at the factory that produced Max 737s, contributing to the crashes.Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at the factory, told Congress he repeatedly warned Boeing's leadership of the safety risks caused by what he described as a ""factory in chaos"", but it had little effect.He also said that, after the crashes, US government regulators have shown little interest in his concerns.""I remain gravely concerned that... the flying public will remain at risk unless this unstable production environment is rigorously investigated and closely monitored by regulators on an ongoing basis,"" he said in prepared testimony.Mr Dickson said the FAA is probing production issues. He also said he is considering further actions against Boeing.In a statement, Boeing said Mr Pierson's own account showed the company took his concerns seriously.""Company executives and senior leaders on the 737 programme were made aware of Mr Pierson's concerns, discussed them in detail, and took appropriate steps to assess them,"" it said.

Why is the world's financial plumbing under pressure?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50069985,"We don't always notice vital infrastructure until something goes wrong. So it was at Citibank in London in the 1960s. On the first floor, payment instructions were inserted into a canister and sent upstairs via vacuum tube. On the second floor, a team confirmed the transactions and sent their authorisations back down the pipe. One day the payments department on the first floor realised it wasn't receiving the authorisations it needed. Someone was sent upstairs, where the confirmation team had been idly wondering why all was quiet. It turned out that the vacuum tube had become blocked. Citibank's payment processing operations were duly restored with the assistance of a chimney sweep. Confirming large financial transactions is hard. It is even harder across national or international borders. Since the development of the telegraph in the first half of the 19th Century, sending instructions has been quick enough. But quick does not necessarily mean foolproof, as Frank Primrose, a Philadelphia wool broker, was to realise.In June 1887, Mr Primrose sent a message to his agent in Kansas about buying wool. Because the Western Union telegraph company charged by the word, the message was in code to save money. It was supposed to say ""BAY ALL KINDS QUO"", meaning ""I've bought half a million pounds of wool"".But it actually read ""BUY ALL KINDS QUO"", which the Kansas agent understood as an instruction to ""Please buy half a million pounds of wool"". Primrose lost $20,000 - several million dollars in today's terms. And Western Union wouldn't compensate him, because he could have paid a few cents extra for the message to be verified - but had not. Clearly, there was a need for a way to send financial information more reliably than through a vacuum tube and more securely than via telegraph in an easily-mistranscribable code. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

But the need to make sure that messages were secure and accurate added enormous complexity. Banks hired former military signalmen to operate their telex machines, and used tables of cross-referenced codes to check and recheck what was being sent. One veteran recalled the laborious complexities of the task:""For every single telex that was sent, you had to manually calculate what this telex test key was. When you received the tested telex, you had to do the reverse calculation to make sure the telex hadn't been tampered with during transmit and receive cycles. It was incredibly prone to human error.""  By the increasingly global 1970s, the telex system was groaning under the strain. Especially in Europe, the need for a better solution - one that could work smoothly across borders - was becoming acute. Committees were established, arguments raged, progress was glacial. Then an American bank started strong-arming everyone into using its own proprietary system, called Marti. This was, as they say in Europe, ""insupportable"". Many banks feared becoming locked in to any standard that was owned by a rival. So they got their act together through a new organisation, Swift - the Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication. Swift was a private company, with its headquarters in Brussels and run as a global co-operative venture, initially between 270 banks across 15 countries. The first Swift message was sent by Prince Albert of Belgium on 9 May 1977 - and the Marti system closed down the same year. Swift simply provided a messaging service, using a standardised format that minimised errors and dramatically simplified proceedings. The computing company Burroughs installed Swift's dedicated computers and connections in Montreal, New York, and 13 European banking centres. Each nation's banks would plug into those central hubs.  The underlying hardware and software continues to change, transmitting and storing 7.8 billion highly sensitive cross-border banking instructions last year. More important than any particular technology is the co-operative structure of the institution, through which more than 9,000 member banks and financial institutions currently agree standards and resolve disagreements.  Hacks, outages and other problems have occurred - often the result of weaknesses in the systems of banks from smaller or poorer nations. Yet they remain rare enough for Swift to seem indispensable. The organisation itself would prefer to stay under the radar, a humble part of the financial pipework, operating out of a lakeside office in the sleepy town of La Hulpe, near Brussels. But having largely solved one problem, Swift may have created another. It is so central to international banking that it is a tempting tool for the 800lb gorilla of the world economy, the US government. Want to track terrorist financing? Examine the Swift database.  Want to destroy the Iranian economy? Tell Swift to deny access to their banks. After all, as any London chimney sweep can tell you - financial pipework can be blocked.Swift has found itself unable to resist direct orders from the US, even when the EU disagrees. Swift isn't interested in geopolitics, but geopolitics is interested in Swift.Political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman see the argument over Swift as an example of what they call ""weaponised interdependence"" - the big players in the global economy using their influence over supply chains, financial settlement and communications networks to monitor and punish wherever they wish. The US's blacklisting of the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei is another example, but it isn't a completely modern tactic. In 1907, after a severe banking crisis had rocked the US and left the British financial system largely intact, British strategists took note. The UK was losing ground as a manufacturing economy, but as a financial hub it remained supreme. The City of London sat at the centre of a web of banks, telegraph lines and the deepest insurance market in the world. The thinking was that in a war, Germany's banks could swiftly be crushed by financial shock and awe.  Spoiler alert: the plan did not work. But that historical parallel is unlikely to frighten the US. It will keep a firm grip on the pressure points of the international economy - including the Swift messaging system. For an organisation that was galvanised as a response to pushy Americans, that is quite a kink in the financial pipe.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Thomas Cook customers face refund delays,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50680106,"Customers of defunct tour operator Thomas Cook have reacted angrily after learning they will face delays in getting refunds for Atol-protected package holidays. The Civil Aviation Authority originally said all valid claims made on the first day of its refund programme would be paid within 60 days, or by this Friday. But now it says only two-thirds will be paid on time.It said it had asked the remaining claimants for more information.Customers have reacted angrily on Twitter, with some arguing they should have been made aware from the start that the process could take longer than 60 days.Others say they have struggled to reach the CAA by phone to get information. CAA boss Richard Moriarty acknowledged many would be worried about not getting their money back before Christmas. ""We thank consumers for their ongoing patience as we continue to do all that we can to work through the UK travel industry's largest ever refunds programme,"" he said. ""I appreciate that this is a concerning time for Thomas Cook customers who are waiting for their refunds, particularly at this time of the year.""When Thomas Cook ceased trading on 23 September, anyone who had paid for a future Thomas Cook package holiday protected under the CAA's Atol scheme was entitled to a full refund. From 7 October an online refund application system opened, and customers were told the Civil Aviation Authority aimed to pay out within 60 days.The CAA said it had received 67,000 claims on the first day, and two thirds would be paid by this weekend, bringing the total amount of compensation paid to date to £160m. Sue Moore applied for a refund for her Thomas Cook holiday on the day the CAA launched its online form. She told the BBC: ""We submitted our claim online and gave the information that they asked for, which was only the information on our Atol form. They did not ask for full booking information or evidence of payment. ""We have waited nearly 60 days only to be told that this additional information was now required, and that we would have to wait a further 60 days before we would receive our refund. ""We are very disappointed and feel that the agency working for the CAA should have thought  through what information would be required in the first instance before people submitted their claims. I wonder if this was a deliberate delaying tactic to delay the payment of refunds?"" But it said the refunds operation had been challenging due to the potential for fraudulent claims, and some 85,000 claims it had received so far were invalid or duplicates. It said it had ""paused"" the 60-day claims period for certain customers, and urged anyone who had been asked for further information to respond at ""the earliest opportunity"".The regulator stressed that all valid Atol-protected payments would be refunded, without giving a specific timeframe. But some who spoke to the BBC said they had been told they would have to wait a further 60 days.Thomas Cook collapsed in September after last-minute negotiations aimed at saving the 178-year-old holiday firm failed.It triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. It also put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, although some of those roles have been saved. The refunds process has been rocky, with the CAA's online form crashing due to high demand on the day it launched. The website was also targeted by scammers, while many customers have said the long wait for refunds has stopped them rebooking holidays.The CAA said it had received 260,000 valid claims to date. But around 40,000 of the cancelled holidays eligible for a refund have still not been claimed for.Customers have until September next year to submit the online form.One of the reassuring things about booking a holiday with a tour operator is that the trip is Atol protected - you know you'll get your money back if anything goes wrong with the company. So the 300,000 customers who had booked package deals with Thomas Cook were at least comforted that they'd get their money back. However, the process has not been an easy one. It's been a difficult job to weed out any hoaxes, and verify passengers across different Thomas Cook booking systems. But the CAA set themselves a tight deadline, to make sure people weren't out of pocket for long. But now it's more disappointment for 22,000 of those early bird customers who applied immediately for a refund and still haven't received a penny back. For many it'll mean things are extra-tight this Christmas, or a longer wait before they can afford to book a new holiday.  Those customers are being advised to provide any extra information asked for, and be patient. Have you been told you will have to wait longer for a Thomas Cook package holiday refund?

Superdry boss 'pleased with progress' despite loss,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50756183,"Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton has said he is ""pleased with the progress"" the fashion retailer has made despite it reporting a half-year loss.Mr Dunkerton said reviving Superdry would ""take two to three years"" and pledged to stay at the firm until 2021.He returned to the company in April after a lengthy campaign against the previous management.Superdry sank to a loss of £4.2m in the six months to 26 October compared with a profit of £26.4m a year earlier.Revenues dropped 11% to £369.1m after the company focused on full price sales and reducing promotions to try to lift profit margins.However, it said its decline in retail sales had moderated during the six months.Mr Dunkerton said: ""At this halfway point in our financial year, I am pleased with the progress we have made to comprehensively reset Superdry.""We are only eight months into a process that will take two to three years, but I have great confidence in the strength of our new executive leadership team.""Mr Dunkerton stepped down from the firm's board in March 2018 but returned this April after narrowly winning a shareholder vote, prompting Superdry executives to resign en masse. He argued the fashion brand, which he co-founded in 2003, had over-extended its range and needed to focus more on the jackets and hoodies that made it famous.In July, when Superdry reported an £85m annual loss, Mr Dunkerton said he wanted to ""steady the ship and get the culture of the business back to the one which drove its original success"" by returning the brand to its ""design-led roots"".Retail analyst Richard Lim, from Retail Economics, said: ""As the boardroom shenanigans begin to settle, these results demonstrate the size of the task at hand"".However, Mr Lim said that going back to the original roots of the business ""remains a questionable strategy given the sheer pace of change in the industry"".""Returning to a brand that once had a point of differentiation, a reason to visit stores and a point of view will be no easy feat.""He added that online Superdry ""falls well short of many of its competitors"".""The long road of recovery is likely to have many twists and turns ahead."""
